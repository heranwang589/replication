I just found this sub-reddit tonight as I was thinking about a lot of opinion topics so I thought it would be a good time to express this opinion of mine. Disclaimer: I'm neither a vegan nor a vegetarian.\n\nI understand that many vegetarians abstain from meat because they feel morally guilty or they feel that it is wrong to kill animals for food. I suppose that some vegetarians may just not want to take part in eating meat themselves and don't really care about the bigger picture but that seems like a shallow and pointless reason to be a vegetarian to me. While meat-eaters don't actively kill the animals themselves by eating them, they support the slaughterhouses and farms that do kill the animals for food production by continuing to consume meat. If meat is demanded it will be supplied, and vegetarians aim to reduce the demand. This to me seems like a much more legitimate purpose and reasoning for being vegetarian. This same philosophy compels people to vote in democratic governments. Even if they are only one person, it takes many individuals to come together to elect representatives. This is the most valid argument that I can think of in favor of moral vegetarianism.\n\nThis philosophy is all fine and good but vegetarians alone will not and cannot fulfill this goal by virtue of not being vegans. As long as dairy products and eggs are consumed, there is still a need for dairy cows and egg-laying chickens. When the cows no longer produce milk and the chickens no longer lay eggs what do you think happens to them? Generally they are turned into meat for human consumption. Vegetarians drink milk and eat cheese that comes from cows that get slaughtered. The only way to lessen meat production is to reduce the number of people with any kind of need or want for animal products. Maybe I'm wrong about what vegetarians aim to accomplish exactly. Any ideas?\n\n\nResponse A Author: eggy_mule\n\nResponse A: Vegetarians and vegans aim to reduce animal suffering by not eating animals/animal products.\n\nMost vegetarians agree that not eating dairy would be better than eating dairy (as milk requires calves to be born, which, if male, are killed soon after birth).\n\nMost vegetarians accept that this is a compromise position. But all morality is a compromise. If I truly lived to my own moral standards, I would be giving far more to the needy, living more frugally, using my free time to be politically active in causes I believed in, etc etc. Instead I do what I can, and accept I am not perfect. Every little bit counts. This is not a reason to not try.\n\nThere is no moral difference between two worlds where in one, half the world was vegan, and the other, everyone just ate half as much meat and dairy.\n\nResponse B Author: Val5\n\nResponse B: First of all, it doesn't matter what you think someone's reason should be, people have different reasons. Neither being vegetarian nor being vegan makes any difference, so you can easily say that every vegetarian \"should\" be an activist and fight harder to make a change.\n\nI totally understand that some people simply don't want to part take in something they see as negative. I was always against bad treatment of animals but i wasn't vegetarian because it wouldn't make a difference. Because of my dog, one day it got harder to have the distance between meat and animal I felt before and meat got less appealing to me. I don't think by not eating it I am making a change, but I feel cleaner personally. And I will still occasionally eat it if I feel like it or it is simpler than a veggie option. \n\nPeople can choose to which extent they want to get into something. I would never give up dairy because I love it and benefit to the world is non existent. But I assume many vegetarians can get their dairy and eggs from better sources, local farms etc where animals aren't treated badly. For some it is a purely health concern, so all together, there is an incentive to treat animals better for these purposes. Since it is totally possible to eat eggs from chickens who live decent lives, no one needs to be vegan,\n\n\nHaving said all that, things still add up. so between people concerned about their own health, moral vegetarians, total vegans, occasional vegetarians, people who simply care about their sources of food etc, a trend is being created that might lead to more humane methods of treating animals. So it's pointless to say what someone should do if they care, and let people choose in which way they want to participate and what is good and healthy for them.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author eggy_mule's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: As a male feminist concerned with the rights of both genders, I must admit that the name \"feminism\" is really unfortunate. I would have liked to align with the people calling themselves egalitarians, but most \"egalitarian\" forums I've seen seem more concerned with calling out feminism than working for gender equality.\n\nAs the rules of this sub necessitate 500 characters or more, I'll go ahead and generalize wildly; I think there is a large amount of cross-over between MRAs, egalitarians, white supremacists, conspiracy theorists and antisemites. It's kind of unfortunate, because all of these \"movements\" touch on valid issues here and there, tainting the efforts of those who are legitimately trying to improve things for everyone.\n\nFor example, if I suspected that black people/white people/women/men were biologically less apt to do math/creation/teamwork/etc, and I devised an academic experiment to test this hypothesis, I would automatically be thought to work on the behalf of hate groups and be discredited - there would be no doubt that I have an agenda, because active hate groups have made those subjects effectively taboo, and anyone oblivious to these taboos are probably seeing the world through the lens of those hate groups.\n\nResponse A Author: IHaveThatPower\n\nResponse A: I am a straight, white male and I self-identify as an egalitarian. I *also* self-identify as a feminist, pro-LGBTA, anti-racist, and several other similar groups. I consider *all of these* to be subsets of egalitarianism focusing on one particular type of inequality. (I also take a fairly dim view of conspiracy theorists, since you mentioned that.) \n\nI also think MRAs -- the well-intentioned ones, not the misogynists-in-disguise -- don't realize that MRM and feminism are *the same thing*. Both are concerned with freeing people from gender roles and ensuring equal treatment regardless of which gender, if any, one identifies. It's the same cause; it doesn't need two different names.\n\nI *prefer* the term egalitarian, for the exact same reason you say you would: \n\n\nI think what you're encountering is at least partly the result of people that have yet to comprehend the various systemic disadvantages slanted against minority or discriminated groups. \"Blacks have it easy because affirmative action!\" might make superficial sense to someone who only sees affirmative action as an easing of the path for one group that is *otherwise equal* to the majority (white) group. It fails to account for the pre-established systemic disadvantages faced by the minority group, which necessitate the \"special treatment\" in the first place. My own encounters with people that hold these sorts of views has consistently shown this to be the case and it's true across a *broad* stripe of ideologies. There are bad apples in ~~any~~ every group driving for social change and this is no less true for egalitarians than it is for any of the groups that fall under its (very large) umbrella. Egalitarianism is simply large enough that it can encompass *all of them*, rather than a particular stripe. \n\nThat there are \"egalitarians\" that sully the ideal of egalitarianism should come as no greater surprise than the existence of \"feminists\" that sully the goals of feminism.\n\nResponse B Author: bluefootedpig\n\nResponse B: Egalitarian simply means to imagine yourself before life, not knowing if you are going to be born poor, rich, male, female, black, white, etc. Before you know this, how would you decide society should look. Should women get special treatment? Should men be in charge? Should we take care of our sick? (you might be born one of the sick). \n\nEgalitarian just strives that each group is treated the same. The reason various hate groups get involved or leverage egalitarian is because many laws are written to favor one group of people. \n\nLet's start with affirmitive action. There are requirements for large companies to hire X percentage of minorities, but there is no law requiring them to hire X percentage of whites. Even though 99.9% of businesses wouldn't have an issue with that, the fact that one group is treated special over another is the problem.\n\nThere is an easy way to address this, and John Locke gave the answer. That is a just government must apply the law equally to all citizens. Impacts must fall on the citizens equally or fairly. Now in the case of taxes, this means a progressive tax system that no matter who you are, you pay based on income. But notice our laws for taxes isn't, \"blacks pay 5% less, Asians 1% less, and white pay full amount of taxes\". We don't have tax brackets for different races.\n\nSo various hate groups, or just different groups, always leverage egalitarian as a rebuttal. The reason feminism is attacked, is because much of feminism aims at helping one specific group (namely women). Like the women protection act, which does provide some help for men, but without a doubt mainly helps women. It is not difficult to write men equally into these laws as well. \n\nSo these groups see bills being passed, that exclude them, be it a hate group, or any group. But Egalitarian is merely the belief that each law should equally affect all groups. The idea that we can stop and frisk you because you look foreign is breaking John Locke's ideal government. \n\nAnd if we want to bring up something on reddit often, look at MGM vs FGM, one is banned in all forms, considered horrific, while the other one is encouraged by the CDC. Why, when FGM was banned, didn't we ban MGM? This is where MRA's get upset. Laws that put children with the mother because she has a vagina. That doesn't apply to all citizens equally. \n\nAnyway, I am rambling now. But Egalitarian is a method of deciding the right thing to do, various minority groups often join in because these groups see themselves as victims, and thus not being treated equally as others in the eyes of government and law. \n\nAnd to be fair, I think many of these people are right. I think we have coded much bias into our laws.

CMV.\n\nOp: ***Background***\n\nI enjoy discussing philosophy, but I increasingly feel that the philosophical questions lose their magic when you break them down critically.\n\nMy philosophical viewpoint rests on two premises that to me seem uncontroversial *(Edit: their controversy status is not central here; think of them as one metatheory that can lead to answers)*:\n\n- The human mind is an instinctive, emotional, stereotypic and subconscious machine, subject to [hundreds of cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) and prone to [hundreds of logical fallacies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies).\n\n- Materialism is the default position until evidence of the contrary is shown.\n\n---\n\n***Categories of fallacious trivialities***\n\nI contend that *philosophical questions in general* *(edit)* can be put into one or more of these five categories:\n\n**1.1.** The concept is a humanly conceptualized [prototype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory) without clearly definable boundaries. The question is as meaningful as \"at what shade does the color red cease to be red?\"\n\n**1.2.** The concept is an artifact of human intuition. Any reasoning will concern human subjectivity rather than the universe around us.\n\n**1.3.** The question is merely a semantic dispute or a syntax error.\n\n**2.** The question can easily be answered within materialistic (or otherwise Ockhamian) axioms. This does not denote absolute truth, but should be the default position.\n\n**3.** The question is ill-suited for philosophy. No amount of purely philosophical reasoning can *(be verified to)* bring one closer to the truth. *(Edit: I've conceded that it might be an arbitrary category.)*\n\n---\n\n***Evaluations of some \"[unsolved problems in philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_philosophy)\"***\n\n**Aesthetics - Essentialism:** *Are there essential properties that make a thing what it is?*\n\nSee **1.1**. It depends on if the thing is already defined by those essential properties. The roundness of a geometrical shape will determine how central it is to the \"circle\" *prototype*, but it can only have a binary relation to the \"perfect circle\" *definition*. Almost all physical things are prototypes of vastly different gradualities.\n\n*Does the quality of art correlate to its degree of organic form?*\n\nSee **1.2**. Even on a subjective basis, it's a very weak idea.\n\n**Aesthetics - Art objects:** *What is art?*\n\nSee **1.1**.\n\n**Epistemology - Gettier problem:** *Can knowledge be defined as justified true belief?*\n\nSee **1.1**. No, as Gettier shows.\n\n*What is knowledge?*\n\nSee **1.1**.\n\n**Epistemology - Molyneux problem:** *If a man born blind, and able to distinguish by touch between a cube and a globe, were made to see, could he now tell by sight which was the cube and which the globe, before he touched them?*\n\nSee **3**. The article itself mentions that this might not be an unsolved problem in philosophy, due to scientific studies.\n\n**Epistemology - Infinite regression:** *As it is impossible to satisfy the justification element due to infinite regression, can one truly have knowledge of anything?*\n\nSee **2**. No. Pragmatically, it doesn't matter.\n\n**Epistemology - M\u00fcnchhausen Trilemma:** *It is impossible to prove any certain truth even in fields such as logic and mathematics. The proof of any theory rests either on circular reasoning, infinite regress, or unproven axioms.*\n\nSee **2**. See the previous question: it's a trivial notion that nothing can be known with 100% certainty. However, a proposition can theoretically be true *within an axiomatic framework itself* (but you can't be 100% certain that you wrote that axiom five seconds ago).\n\n**Epistemology - Qualia:** *Is your blue the same as my blue?*\n\nSee **2** and **1.2**. If our brains are the same, then necessarily so.\n\n*Is a human experience inherently different from that of philosophical zombie or a sufficiently advanced AI?*\n\nSee **2** and **1.2**. No.\n\n**Ethics - Moral luck:** *A poor person is born into a poor family, and has no other way to feed himself so he steals his food. Another person, born into a very wealthy family, does very little but has ample food and does not need to steal to get it. Should the poor person be more morally blameworthy than the rich person?*\n\nSee **1.2**.\n\n**Philosophy of language - Moore's disbelief:** *A first-person present-tense sentence such as, \"It's raining but I don't believe that it is raining\" is paradoxical.*\n\nSee **1.3**. The full form \"I believe that it is raining, but I don't believe that it is raining\" is a trivial syntax error.\n\n**Philosophy of mathematics - Mathematical objects:** *What are numbers, sets, groups, points, etc.? Are they real objects or are they simply relationships that necessarily exist in all structures?*\n\nSee **2**. They are formal abstractions of the world around us -- not vice versa.\n\n**Metaphysics - Sorites paradox:** *Is a bale of hay still a bale of hay if you remove one straw? If so, is it still a bale of hay if you remove another straw (ad infinitum)?*\n\nSee **1.1**.\n\n**Metaphysics - Counterfactuals:** *What is meant when one asserts a conditional statement, the antecedent of which is contrary to fact? E.g. \"If Joseph Swan had not invented the modern incandescent light bulb, then someone else would have invented it anyway.\"*\n\nSee **1.3**.\n\n**Metaphysics - Material implication:** *In formal logic, the statement \"If today is Saturday, then 1+1=2\" is true; a causal or meaningful relation is not required. There is a discrepancy between material implication and the general conception of conditionals: is it an inadequacy in formal logic, an ambiguity of ordinary language, or no discrepancy?*\n\nValid question by itself, but see **3** and **1.2**.\n\n**Philosophy of mind - Mind-body problem:** *Is the mind separate from the physical body?*\n\nSee **1.2** and **2**. No.\n\n**Philosophy of mind - Cognition and AI:** *What are the criteria for intelligence?*\n\nSee **1.1**.\n\n*Is it possible to artificially create consciousness?*\n\nSee **2**. Theoretically yes.\n\n**Philosophy of mind - Hard problem of consciousness:** *Why is there a subjective component to experience?*\n\nSee **1.2** and **2**. *(Edit: personal hypothesis)* Short answer -- evolution. It seems clear that an organism with a conception of a coherent self-experience would have an evolutionary advantage. For how it actually arose, see **3**.\n\n**Philosophy of science - Problem of induction:** *(1) Any inductive statement (like the sun will rise tomorrow) can only be deductively shown if one assumes that nature is uniform. (2) The only way to show that nature is uniform is by using induction. Thus induction cannot be justified deductively.*\n\nSee **2**. Indeed, it's as previously mentioned a trivial notion that nothing can be known with 100% certainty. Pragmatically, it doesn't matter.\n\n**Philosophy of science - Demarcation problem:** *\"The problem of finding a criterion which would enable us to distinguish between the empirical sciences on the one hand, and mathematics and logic as well as \"metaphysical\" systems on the other\"*\n\nSee **1.2**. Mathematics and logic are not divine concepts, but rather useful human inventions based on axioms from what seems inductively obvious to us. Distinguishing between completely physical fields and completely abstract fields seems like the only possible answer. Human intuition might lead one to believe that there is a gradualness between physics and mathematics for example, but in reality, mathematics is a thoroughly abstract model of a study that is physical by definition. As for \"metaphysical systems\", see **2**.\n\n**Philosophy of science - Realism:** *Is there a world independent of human beliefs and representations?*\n\nSee **1.2** and **2**.

The way you just handwave away many of these without actually *saying* anything doesn't give one much to consider, much less actually respond to.  For example:\n\nSee 2 and 1.2. No.\n\nSeriously?  You think that that is sufficient to support your claim that humans have no subjective experience?  You've given no one any reason to accept that claim. \n\nSee 1.2 and 2. Short answer -- evolution. It seems clear that an organism with a conception of a coherent self-experience would have an evolutionary advantage. For how it actually arose, see 3.\n\nAgain, you've said precisely nothing beyond \"nuh-uh\". It is *not* \"clear\" at all that subjective experience confers an advantage, hence why there is a debate.  Also, you just finished claiming we don't even have it, so clearly you find it non-obvious as well.\n\nI could go on about others, but I think that's enough for now. \n\nMore broadly, on the topic of your numbered items themselves, you seem to have missed the step as to why you think that, even if your items are true, this says anything about philosophy.  For example, your response to the question of what qualifies something as having intelligence was to say nothing more than \"it's a concept without strict boundaries\". Okay....sure. But so what?  Are questions about the usage of such concepts and how they relate to others somehow intrinsically excluded from philosophical analysis?  You've provided no reason to think so.  What is the basis of your claim that philosophy is not allowed to deal with questions of that nature?  \n\nRather than show that a question is trivial, many of your examples do nothing more than serve as a *categorization* of a question.  Categorization is not to be confused with *resolving* a question. \n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: Your claim is a non-sequitor. An analogy would be to say that because life can be broken down into one of the following categories, inquiries into the nature and function of living matter are trivial.\n1.a viruses\nb. single cell bacteria\n2.a. Plants\n3.1 Insects\n4.Fish\n5. Mammals\n6.i Reptiles\n7. Birds\n8. Non-living matter\n\nAs for the materialism, the bit that materialism is the default position is an interesting philosophical choice. Do you mean to say that imaginary numbers are material? If they exist now in their own right, what happens if there are no humans to imagine them? This doesn't seem to hold for material items.

In terms of biodiversity, I don't see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my (limited) understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now. As far as humans lives are concerned, I don't think it's essential that seven billion people live on the Earth. I think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note I'm not sure I care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.\n\nSo why should I, as an individual, be invested in preventing climate change?\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: funmaker0206\n\nResponse A: You seem to be under the notion that there won't be any immediate problems that effect you. So I'll try to cover what I can off the top of my head since I'm on mobile.  \n  \n  \nYes this will be a problem however the more serious issue is changing climate patterns, specifically regarding desertification. Soil for agriculture is a mix of different particles mainly sand and smaller more nutritious particles. When an area goes with out water for an extended time period, like California did recently, those small nutritious particles blow away. This could mean a dramatic decrease in crop yields all over the globe and probably loss of life because of food shortages as well.   \n  \n  \nThis is another problem that we'll be facing. While it is true that this won't effect everyone immediately or even close to the near future, it will effect a lot of people indirectly. Perhaps you saw that CNN crossfire with Bill Nye where the mentioned how a road in North Carolina, USA (I think) has to be raised a few feet because of rising sea levels (or at least in the future). This is just a small example of some infrastructure changes that will need to be implemented to accommodate for this. Housing for a lot of people will need to be relocated as well as the businesses and factories that are also in these zones.  \n  \nI would also argue that the biodiversity aspect is important, but that is a different CMV topic. So think of this economically. If there was any other type of problem that would result in loss of life, thousands of jobs, hundreds of thousands of homes, and reduced quality of life for those who weren't affected by the former, wouldn't you consider that a problem that should be addressed? Even more so, wouldn't you think it foolish of the people who knew this was coming and knew how to stop it in time but did nothing?  \n\nResponse B Author: payik\n\nResponse B: \nWeather patterns are already noticeably changing.\n\n\nYes, only that we could be one of those species that didn't make it, or we could be thrown back into the stone age. \n\n\nThere is only so much we can do, and while dying out is not very likely, life could be miserable. It's simply not worth it. It takes just around 2\u00b0C warming for the costs clearly outweigh the benefits. Weather paterns would change considerably and great many people would have to migrate. That would cause great tensions and possibly wars. \n\n2\u00b0C probably not archievable any more. 6\u00b0C, which is the best estimate for no serious efforts taken to stop the warming would be a dystopian world. Basically no life on Earth is adapted to such hot climate. Life could adapt if it took a hundred thousand years, but not in a century. The metabolism of C3 plants becomes much less efficient with higher temperatures, which would mean much lower yields of less nutritious food. Many seas would be devoid of life. It would be a completely different world. The last glacial period was only 5.6\u00b0C colder than the modern period and most of Europe was covered by glaciers and tundra.\n\nAnd the more pessimistic estimates like 12+\u00b0C would probably mean the end of humanity. It would no longer be possible to live in most of the world without advanced technology, it would be simply too hot to live. It would be so hot you would die, with no low-tech means to cool you down. The usual methods don't work any more when temperatures and humidity go high enough, (drinking enough water wouldn't help, fans would feel more like hair dryers, ...) and people would have to live in enclosed buildings and not go outside most of the time, or live only in places like Tibet or the Arctic.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author funmaker0206's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

It would be unconstitutional, as it's essentially \"[this much] life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.\" A corporation shouldn't be a person, but since they are ran by people you can't limit their freedom to LAWFULLY (all caps for emphasis) pursue high profits. Plus, as said before, you do limit the quality of products made when there is no incentive to make the best product (as you can only profit but so much.)\n\nNot trying to defend business, I just think your idea is more based on correlation than causation.

But either way, they will make what people want to pay for it.\n\nAnd then, seeing how much they made, another company comes in and invests to make an even better game.  And the same thing begins again.\n\nThen, the first company goes back, invests a ton in a 3rd game, which completely bombs.\n\nWho is harmed by this process?  Nobody is screwed because they don't have to buy the game.  We end up with not just one but two great games because of the profit motive.  The first company is able to survive the failure of game 3 because of the profits they made on game 1.\n\nNow, in your scenario, the developer behind the game, who is working a boring job writing code for spreadsheet software takes a look and decides that it's not worth the risk of quitting his job and spending a couple of years developing the killer game.  Or even if he does, company 2 decides that it's not worth the investment for 15%.\n\nNow, Comcast is another story.

Rather than through free will becoming interested, or making ourselves interested in certain fields and applying the hard work, we are pigeonholed from birth. \n\nWe can determine how far we get on our path, but its seems the path itself was determined in the first place, talent making the rest an illusion. \n\n\nResponse A Author: NaturalSelectorX\n\nResponse A: \nTalent just gives you an advantage in a certain pursuit.

It's easy to envision someone who *would be* talented in (let's say) piano but who doesn't *like* it, and therefore goes into neuroscience or something. They may have been a star piano player if they chose, and they may have ended up being only a middling neuroscientist, but their talent didn't define their life choice.\n\nYour whole approach is the product of confirmation bias. The people who are truly outstanding in their fields are the people for whom a confluence of factors came together in just the right way at just the right time. Talent is certainly one of these factors, but it's not the only one. If someone is talented in X and goes into X, you say \"Oh, talent! It defined their life.\" But if someone is talented in X and goes into Z, you say \"Oh, they're just an average joe with no particular talents.\"\n\nIt's also easy to envision someone who is talented but lazy/unambitious not getting as far *even in the field in which they have talent* as someone who is more \"average\" at the beginning but who devotes their entire life to that pursuit.

Here are some things that I viewed as traditionally viewed as safe spaces for men:\n\n1) Video games which were dominated by men for a while now have even genders overall, in hard core games where women are a low percentage the gamer community/games themselves are labeled as sexist. See: Female character model controversies, Mirrors Edge 2, Assassins Creed, etc.\n\n2) Jobs dominated by men (engineering, blue collar jobs, etc.) are being encouraged more and more for females to join. At the same time society is essentially calling these jobs/companies sexist because of the low percentages of women which has resulted in lots of companies pushing hard for more women in the work place.\n\n3) Domestic shelters are dominated in numbers by women with few shelters being available for men. \n\n4) Websites on the internet, like reddit, have the communities called sexist all the time and even now we are seeing a constant push towards making reddit more female friendly (see: twoxchromosomes becoming a default subreddit) and pushing aside the male demographic.\n\nAnyway, the result of all of this is I think that men essentially have limited/no avenues for places to talk to other men, where as women have a plethora of places that they can go to. Any place that was once traditionally male dominated is being gutted, but females still get to keep their exclusivity. \n\nCMV?\n\nResponse A Author: serenity-bumblebee\n\nResponse A: Certain job fields, gaming communities and subreddits are called sexist not because fewer women than men are present but because the attitudes propagated in those environments are sexist. I'd hazard a guess that /r/DIY has more men than women as regular contributors, but nothing about that is sexist; meanwhile /r/redpillwomen is (presumably) mostly women and is very sexist against women. \n\nDomestic shelters I do agree with, as there are many places that lack adequate facilities for male victims of domestic violence. That said, women tend to have a greater number of shelters dedicated to them because women represent about 60% of domestic violence cases - not quite 100%, but still a substantial majority.\n\nOn another level, let's break down what you call \"traditionally safe spaces for men\": Video games, engineering and blue collar jobs, and online communities. Why should those things be deemed \"for men only\", when there's nothing inherent about them that makes them inappropriate for women? Video games can and do cater to both genders, women can be equally competent engineers and blue collar workers, and online communities are for everyone who has an interest in the focus of the community to contribute to. Meanwhile, what are traditionally female safe spaces? Women's groups, women's gyms, women's shelters - all things that are explicitly created with women in mind. You're pointing to gender neutral parts of society and saying that they should be for men; why should they be? The [Men's Shed movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men's_Sheds) is combatting the fact that an equivalent to women's groups doesn't exist for men and that's a positive step forward - what isn't a step forward is saying that anything that isn't traditionally dominated by women should be less accommodating to them so that men don't have to create their own gendered safe spaces.\n\nResponse B Author: MackDaddyVelli\n\nResponse B: It seems to me that in all of your examples you're saying that the fact that public spaces are becoming less segregated by gender that there are less \"safe spaces\" for men.  That is not the case.  There's no reason that video games, historically male-dominated jobs, domestic shelters, or websites like reddit *should* be male-dominated places -- they should be places for equal opportunity for all, and that is what is happening.  Men aren't becoming oppressed, they're becoming equal.\n\nThe reason that there *are* support groups for women, \"safe spaces,\" and whatnot is because historically men and women have not been equal.  Historically, men *have* dominated many places and so women had no choice but to set up women-friendly spaces that were predominantly for and by women.  As women slowly gain equality to men in every aspect of life, you will likely see these groups fade away, but I don't see it happening for a long while.  We've made a great amount of progress in the past 150 years, but we're still far from true equality.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author serenity-bumblebee's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

For specifics, the Saudi Arabian government violates:\n\n* Article 3\n\n\nIf one observes the practices of the Sharia Law set forth in Saudi Arabia, it becomes clear that these are clearly not respected rights. For one, the women of Saudi Arabia are the subjects and objects of their husbands, having hardly any right to life, as they can be killed for vaguely defined reasons such as \"dishonouring the family\" or \"acting in a manner unbefitting of a woman\". Even in the case of the Princesses of Saudi Arabia, there is no distinction. They can be punished as easily and publicly as a servant, without consequences under the law. This also violates their right to security, as they have no guarantee that the government will protect them against any abuses. By extension, their right to liberty is violated, as once again, the male of a house holds immense amounts of legal power over the female. Several examples are found in this quote:\n\n\nBecause of the bastardized version of Islam many of the powerful men of Saudi Arabia choose to follow, they interpret many things from their religious texts, including that women are the source of all evil, that they should not be allowed to study or work, and that if they do they will negatively affect everyone around them. Due to this, the right to liberty in Saudi Arabia for Saudi woman is not only de facto non-existant but also de jure non-existant. The Mutawa of Saudi Arabia are very powerful as they serve as the religious police. They are so powerful that they have the power to prosecute a member of the Saudi Royal Family, which, to my knowledge, has never been done. The point is that they serve as a very powerful force in the oppression of  women in Saudi Arabia, and given the power of Sharia Law over the Saudis, they easily cast shadows on the liberty of all the women of Saudi Arabia.\n\n* Article 5\n\n\nThis is probably the most infringed on right in the Kingdom. The punishments under the Law in Saudi Arabia include, but are not limited to, lashes, stoning, drowning, death by firing squad, death by crucifixion, death by beheading, with the option of public punishments, just as one would offer with a spectator sport. If Saudi Arabia allowed as much choice in the living of live as they did in the ending of life, they would be much better off.\n\nOut of these items, three stand out. Cruxifiction, stoning, and beheading are all barbaric and extremely cruel ways of punishment. In the case of beheading, during the process, I can only imagine that the subject would experience immense pain as the executioner proceeded to cut through his throat, then the thick muscles of his neck, and then all the way through the spinal cord. There is no debate that this is a violation of Article 5. Cruxifiction , for those who don't know, means that you would be nailed to a plank of wood or some such surface to bleed out, or more likely, die of starvation or stoning while nailed to the wall like an animal skin. I'm not even going to bother explaining why that infringes son Article 5. Lastly, stoning. Since when has having stones hurled at you a normal punishment? Not only is it extremely degrading, it is also extremely cruel, and extremely stupid. I think I've said enough on this topic.\n\n* Article 7\n\n\nWomen are not equal before the law. I mentioned it above under Article 3, but once again, it is blatantly clear that women are not treated as equals under the law. Not only are they completely unrepresented in the Saudi Arabian government, even the Royal women have barely any power. With a court system, law enforcement system, army, and executive system all run by men, I would find it very hard to believe that they are given equal protection or treatment under the law. The simple fact that it is completely legal for a man to kill his wife with \"proper reason\" is evidence enough for this point.\n\n* Article 9\n\n\nI'm not even going to bother to explain this one myself, and I will instead leave you with [this](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30744693?ocid=socialflow_twitter), [this](http://www.arabianbusiness.com/saudi-arabia-executes-54-people-in-first-3-months-of-2015-588431.html), and [this](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/siti-zainab-saudi-arabia-beheads-mentally-ill-female-domestic-worker-angering-indonesia-1496492).\n\n* Article 10\n\n\nI'm losing steam writing about this, so I'll leave you with a few quotes to prove my point:\n\n\n\n* Article 13\n\n(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.\n\nSaudi woman require permission from the head of the house (husband, father, or male relative) to leave the country. They can be sequestered in their own homes and forbidden from leaving, returning, or any number of things that would restrict their movement. I quoted this above, but it is also relevant here:\n\n\n* Article 16\n\n(2) Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.\n(3) The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.\n\nEvery single god damn right in Article 13 is utterly non-existant for the women of Saudi Arabia. They do NOT have equal rights during marriage, as a women has to go through the highly biased court systems to achieve a divorce whereas a man need only say, \"On this day I have divorced you.\" They certainly do not marry with consent, teenage girls often marrying 55 or 60 year old men, maybe even older than their own father. And if you think that the family is protected under the law, from, say, a father threatening to execute his daughter for \"indecency\", then I advise you look into exactly how that doesn't happen.\n\n* Article 18\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has a de jure restriction on the right of freedom of religion, as the only allowed religion is Sunni Islam, and Sunni Islam alone. No other denominations of Islam or ANY OTHER RELIGION are allowed to be practiced. Anyone marrying a Saudi citizen or attempting to be a Saudi national MUST convert to Islam, with no exceptions. \n\n* Article 19\n\n\nCensoring of the media, of the press, and of the basic expression of thought through speech are all restricted heavily in Saudi Arabia. No further explanation is needed, simply look at the first article linked above under Article 9.\n\n* Article 20\n\n(2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association.\n\nThe second point above is infringed on; by being forced to convert to Islam, you are also being forced to join the mosque and participate in practices such as praying at the specified times and observing religious customs as part of the mosque...unless you're a woman, in which case I don't believe that you are allowed in a mosque. But I may be wrong about this.\n\n* Article 21\n\n(2) Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country.\n(3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.\n\nThey are a monarchy and a theocracy, breaking point three of Article 21. Women are allowed no representation in the government, breaking point one in Article 21. I don't believe there is a such thing as public service in Saudi Arabia, so point two can be entirely disregarded in this case.\n\n* Article 23\n\n(2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.\n(3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.\n(4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.\n\nWomen DO NOT have the inherent right to work, nor the right to even have an education so that they might one day work. In the case of equal pay, women simply not being allowed to work takes care of that issue right there. Point three of Article 23 can be entirely ignored under these circumstances, and point 4 is entirely untrue in Saudi Arabia, as I doubt the poor laborers have ever heard of the word \"union\" used in that context.\n\n* Article 26\n\n(2) Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.\n(3) Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.\n\nWOMEN DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION. Again and again this will surface. Women are extremely restricted in all manner of ways, violating their basic rights as human beings. Furthermore, the one-sided Islamic based education that people are allowed to go through in Saudi Arabia is little more than indoctrination of the falsifications that have plagued the bastardized version of Islam all too many people think is the true interpretation of the religion!\n\nFinally, I have finished cataloging all of their violations of ONLY the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This was **established by the UN itself** and is being **broken by one of it's main members**. If this isn't grounds for removal, I don't know what is.\n\nI know Saudi Arabia is a large economic player, is one of the founding members of several Arab confederates and alliances, as well as a major player in OPEC, but by sending our (United States) President to that country, allowing them to serve in the United Nations, an organization committed to stopping violence and promoting fairness and equality, and maintaining an allied relationship with them is not only hypocritical, it is morally wrong. I don't see how one could argue that they shouldn't be removed from the United Nations, nor can I see how one could justify ANY of the actions or laws listed above.\n\nIf you want to change my mind, I'd be open to listening to the economic, geo-political, and military perspectives of this argument, but if you insist on arguing morality here, I'm open to hearing it.\n\nThank you in advance for reading and responding thoughtfully!\n\n\n\nAnd thank you for all the thoughtful responses. I'm in school right now but when I get home I will respond to ALL of them, I promise!\n\n\nThanks, everyone!\n\n\nResponse A Author: mr-tibbs\n\nResponse A: I see your mind has already been changed, so maybe it's too late, but anyway.\n\nThe main thing that leaps to my mind is that you've listed several ways that Saudi government contravenes articles in the UDHR, a UN document. Saudi Arabia can be held accountable for this because they are a UN member, and therefore meant to follow the rules laid out in this document. That's not to say that they successfully *are* being held to account, but that's beside the point.\n\nIf Saudi Arabia is kicked out of the UN, then they have no requirement to pay any attention to UN laws. It would be very difficult to hold them to account based on UN definitions of what a country should and shouldn't do.\n\n...so if you want to hold them accountable by UN laws, then they need to first be a member of the UN. From there, you can start pushing for change. By kicking them out, you're restricting your legal options for challenging their current practices.\n\nResponse B Author: TThor\n\nResponse B: The simplest explanation of why modern countries don't outright reject and criticize Saudi Arabia:\n\nOil.\n\nThis world runs on fossil fuels, and no major country wants to cut themselves off from Saudi Arabia's massive oil supply.\n\nThat oil also gets Saudi Arabia money, which they can use to wield additional influence.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author mr-tibbs's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Some people find it difficult to lose weight for many reasons. I get that. I fucking despise working out until I finish doing it. It's awful stuff, I'd much rather be doing other less strenuous shit. But I still do it anyway because even though I'm not built like a brick shit-house (Australian for big and tough) I still find that it maintains the shape of my body. \n\nIf I didn't work out then I would get fat or at least start looking pretty sloppy i.e. gut etc. But When that starts to happen I eat a little better and work-out and do my best to pull away from being fat or obese. If I didn't have showers twice a day I would stink. It sucks. People don't think I smell bad but it's because I put in the effort to shower when I wake up and before I go to sleep. If I didn't I would stink and people would react accordingly. If I stank enough to need 3 showers then I would do my best to do so. Even if there was a trend running in the wealthier parts of the world where more people were stinking, I would still try to shower enough. I wouldn't just accept it. \n\nPlease, if anyone is thinking of posting an argument saying that \"it's really hard for some people\", or anything close to that, do not do it. I get for a select few, weight must be impossible to lose. We are human, some people are born with hearts out of their fucking chest, I'm sure some people just literally can't lose weight. But I don't believe all the fat people here in Australia and America should even think about asking to not be teased or ridiculed. Obviously, I don't advocate street rallies against the fatties. I'm just saying that as far as people would normally ridicule stinky people or dirty people then so should that level of ridicule be due obese people. Some people stink more and so they have to shower more. Some people gain weight quicker or faster or easier and so they should be more healthy and work out harder to avoid being fat -- otherwise they are fair game.

I just am curious to see if people can CMV on seeing the broad obesity \"problem\" in the West as a personal hygiene failing. THIS ALSO MEANS THAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE PEOPLE NOT TO TRY TO CMV BY CITING THEIR FAT COUSIN OR FAT-SELVES WHO HAVE A DISEASE DISALLOWING FAT LOSS OR EXERCISE. \n\nSo change my view or just tell me I'm wrong. Feel free to be hostile if I am blatantly wrong.  \n\nResponse A Author: caeppers\n\nResponse A: How would you feel if someone ridiculed you for something they thought wasn't socially acceptable but is perfectly normal for you? Why do you think it's acceptable to ridicule or tease anyone for any reason? What exactly would that accomplish? If you know someone and you think some fault of them affects your, their or anyone else's life in a negative way by all means tell them so if you feel the need to. But for anyone you don't know, whose situation and how they got there you're not familiar with I think it's just plain rude to be as hostile as you describe. There's an infinite number of ways to get yourself into a bad situation or start a bad habit and some of them are of course no one's fault but your own but a lot of them simply aren't. And you simply cannot tell them just by looking at someone.\n\nResponse B Author: Lord_Vectron\n\nResponse B: The key difference is the how easy it is to revert back to \"acceptable\" levels. \n\nIf someone has not showered in a long time, they can fix it in an hour. If they have eaten too much and exercised too little for a long time it can take an equally long time to get back to normal and most importantly, all the way during the process of becoming normal they are still unacceptable, just slightly less unacceptable than previous. Which means unless you monitor them, you won't be aware of improvement, so you would mistreat a person that is actually already aware and working very hard on \"fixing\" themselves. \n\nI do agree in general that society should be less content with it's citizens becoming unhealthy but more subtle or at least private methods must be used.

Something is wrong with us.\n\nThe rich business savvy Brits they are and the music they make is not only an inauthentic loose impression of folk-Americana music, but by bridging the gap between that genre and corporate pop, they have perverted the essence of what folk is supposed to be.\n\nThere exists a tradition of confronting the zeitgeist of society in folk music, an independent spirit that will stand up to the bland apathy of a generation of pundits and the status quo. In the sixties, folk music mattered to a generation who needed to express a message.\n\nWe need folk musicians now more than ever with something important to say that matters from a sincere place for a population that needs a voice. That's what Dylan did, and the literal opposite of what Mumford is doing with their whitewashed genre mash-up.\n\nThey are selling records and tickets to people who refuse to confront issues or challenge their minds with innovation in the form of organic music. They might as well be fucking robots, and robots are not allowed to play folk music for the sake of all that's holy.\n\nWhat they make is the soundtrack to a commercial, designed to capture one's attention in small doses without any sort of meaningful investment on the part of the listener.\n\nAs critics have pointed out, their songs are a manufactured lowest common denominator formula.

The true afficinados or people who look for more meaning in their music will not look on the top 40 charts or even the genre-specific charts. The people who like soft jazz are unlikely the audience for more challenging music, the people who like their rap with social commentary aren't the audience for Pitbull, and so forth. Weak imitations of certain genres speak to different audiences than the core audience of that genre. \n\nEven if we assume that Mumford and Sons is no longer played, it is unlikely that innovative and confrontational folk would take it's place. It is more likely it would be replaced with other unobtrusive and bland music. Even if it was, it would likely suffer the same fate as Woody Guthrie's \"This Land is Your Land\" where the commonly played versions eliminate the controversial verses left the song void of the intended political message. Dumbing down the music that appeals to core fans is arguably more damaging than soulless imitations intended to appeal to completely different audiences. \n\nResponse B Author: feartrich\n\nResponse B: Why do you give a shit about other people's preferences?

You view abortion (as I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong) as a way of getting out of the responsibility of raising a child, and thus, both parents should have this right. I would contest this view - I am pro-choice, but I don't think that the right to an abortion comes from a women's right to avoid the responsibility of raising a child; it comes from her ownership of her own body, and her right to choose what to do with it. [This view is well demonstrated out in the Famous Violinist thought experiment, which you can read here.](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2012/02/the-under-rated-famous-violinist-defense-of-abortion/)\n\nObviously, this defense of abortion does not cover men. And I find your underlying logic, that men should be able to avoid this responsibility in a way analogous to women, to be unconvincing. After all, in the 'male opt out' scenario, that responsibility is not going away, it is just being entirely shifted to the mother. \n\nPlus, you have to consider how much power this gives to men who get a women pregnant. They only have to sign one form to get out of a lifetime of payments which the mother will rely on; this is a huge bargaining chip could be used for blackmail. After all, there is no way of knowing how genuine the signer is about wanting the mother to get an abortion; we only know the end result will be the mother no longer getting financial support. \n\nResponse B Author: Aldrake\n\nResponse B: - Does he have to do so in writing?

And if the result is that the father would be required to pay child support, what incentive does Mother have to even look?

Maybe I used ineffective search terms. Whatever.\n\nI was raised evangelical Christian (Southern Baptist, specifically). All through my life I held Christian viewpoints. I still do, but I am discovering that a lot of the Southern Baptist doctrines are little more than traditions established over the years, and have little to no Biblical basis, or else are based on misinterpretations of scripture.\n\nRecently I've been more and more often pulled into the conflict between the church and gay rights. Now, I've already made my position clear on gay rights: People shouldn't be discriminated against for their sexual orientation, regardless of how we feel as a religion about their actions; it's between two consenting adults and we don't have a right to legislate that, and as Christians we should treat them with love.\n\nFurthermore, as a heterosexual male married to a heterosexual female, I have no personal stake in this. However, I'm finding it difficult to reconcile some parts of my worldview with the idea that homosexuality is morally wrong from God's perspective. I have heard some fairly solid arguments each way. In short, I am on the fence and that's not where I like to be. \n\nI am aware of the following points regarding homosexuality:\n\n1: Something being \"natural\" or \"unnatural\" does not have any bearing upon its morality.\n\n2: Homosexuality is overtly condemned in the Old Testament law... along with a lot of other things that modern Christians do not follow due to Christ's example and the release of many of the prohibitions upon Christian gentiles. So OT condemnations don't have any weight unless they come with a convincing argument that the lifting of the limitations doesn't apply to that particular part.\n\n3: There are parts of the New Testament that condemn homosexuality, as well.\n\nSo, from the perspective of a Christian, Change My View. Either convince me scripturally that homosexuality is wrong, or that it is not condemned. But keep it within the scope of Christian values, please. I'm not asking whether it's right or wrong. I'm asking whether it's scripturally defensible.\n\n\nMy real question, then, is is homosexuality sin at all? Does God look down on it? Is it harmful to us the same way other sin is? Does it displease the Creator?\n\nBonus points: Is there any defense for homosexuality being okay with God that doesn't abolish the institution of monogamy, or cause promiscuity to be okay? \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: X019\n\nResponse A: The Bible is a complex canon of letters written to the early churches. We can't just take one verse from here and one verse from there and form out beliefs on it. This leads to some pretty bad stuff.\n\nAs far as homosexuality goes, I'll take a more philisophical approach rather than specific verses, since you could do a Google search on all of the various interpretations of the verses you know about.\n\n\nI will argue that it isn't. We see examples of sin throughout the Bible. It is always destructive to someone. Bearing false witness ruins someone's reputation, cheating on your spouse ruins your relationship, murdering someone doesn't need explanation. All sin follows some sort of a pattern. Homosexuality doesn't follow this pattern. It wouldn't make sense for God to have this be a sin if it didn't follow in lines with the others.\n\n\n\nI don't think so. We are here to love others and to bring Glory to God. I don't see how someone who is in a homosexual relationship is incapable of doing those things.\n\n\nHomosexuals and heterosexuals are held to the same relationship standards. Keep one spouse, serve each other in humility and serve and glorify God with your lives and marriage. Promiscuity is bad as it damages your relationship with your future spouse.\n\nResponse B Author: tamist\n\nResponse B: To my knowledge, the bible is clear about male homosexuality but says nothing about female homosexuality. So to CYV - men engaging in homosexual activities is a sin in Christianity, but not females engaging in homosexuality. As far as verses that say things about homosexuals being abominations (without reference to gender) this can easily be interpreted (if you translate it taking historical context into consideration) as homosexual prostitution being a sin. When the bible was written, homosexuality looked much different then it does today. Mostly, it was prostitutes, not monogamous couples. This doesn't counter the verses that say \"if a man lies with another man as he would with a woman...\" (Paraphrasing here) which is why from a Christian POV gay males are still sinning, but does easily excuse the other verses that refer to homosexuality in general, if you take historical context into consideration (which you should IMHO).

For many (most?), however, fines are intended to recoup the cost of fixing the problem.  If you litter, it makes the area less beautiful and needs to be cleaned.  The loss of beauty has a cost associated with it that is unrelated to whether the litterer was rich or poor.  The cleanup costs a fixed amount.  We just need to charge enough to pay for all the issues even after taking into consideration that many people aren't caught.  If Warren Buffet decided to litter all the time and pay the fines each time, that wouldn't be a problem.  His money would pay for the cleanup.\n\n\nJaywalking is kind of a bad example for both of our positions because it's not intended to fix the problem or to deter the rich and poor equally.  It is only intended to deter the poor.  Enforcement of jaywalking statutes very clearly is different between rich and poor areas.  http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/06/06/jaywalking-panhandling-tickets-vancouver-poor-areas_n_3395385.html \nhttp://www.beyondblackwhite.com/racism-and-anti-poor-tactics-all-rolled-into-one-blacks-in-college-community-receive-excessive-tickets-for-jaywalking/\nIn wealthier areas there are more crosswalks and fewer tickets if one does walk outside crosswalks.  Poorer areas have fewer crosswalks and more tickets.  The reason is that jaywalking isn't actually unsafe.  It just impedes the flow of traffic.  And we just don't find the walking convenience of poor people to justify slowing traffic.\n\nResponse B Author: urnbabyurn\n\nResponse B: It depends on the theory you are employing to justify fines.\n\nThe economic theory of deterrence is that certain actions impose costs on others. Therefore to discourage an inefficient level of that activity, we set fines to a level reflecting the social cost. More precisely, we set the fine times the expected probability of enforcement to the social cost.\n\nSo if jaywalking causes a potential harm averaging $100 and a person has a 10% chance of getting caught, setting the fine to $1000 would mean a person choosing whether to jaywalk would face the social cost and make the efficient choice (if their benefits are more than $1000, it's efficient to jaywalk in that case). \n\nWhat would adjusting fines to income accomplish? In this theory, it wouldn't increase efficiency. People who are willing to pay more derive more value from the activity. This means the fines for some are then set too high and others too low.\n\nAlternatively, if fairness is an issue, then it begs the question of why fines aren't just set prohibitively high. If the goal is to prevent jaywalkers, why not just set the fine for everyone to a maximum, like $1m or even a lifetime jail sentence. It would save a lot of money on enforcement. We wouldn't need as many cops to issue sanctions and less people would jaywalk.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author GnosticGnome's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

When your diaper is changed, you don't know what's going on except that you're suddenly very cold and are having a cold, wet cloth wiping your nether regions.\n\nI don't know about you, but I can't really blame newborns for screaming a lot of the time, even if it is annoying to adults.\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: NoTraceNotOneCarton\n\nResponse A: I assume we are talking about young infants: what I am about to say is quite untrue for toddlers. \n\nThe worst part about pain is the anxiety that comes along with it. Chronic pain causes depression not because of the physical sensation alone - a large part of it is the anxiety that accompanies the realization of all the future pain you will experience. Would you rather be told today that you will die in a horrifying, gruesome accident (but not be told when) or would you rather just have it happen at some point without knowing of it? Most people would pick the latter because of the mental anguish caused by being aware of the future. \n\nBabies do not have this. Infants cannot imagine the future and what it will be like - they experience only the present. \n\nOf course babies experience pain. But all animals do. So in that way, babies do not have it any worse. The anxiety you are describing from feeling helpless simply is not there - it's only awareness of the present. If YOU were turned into a baby, it would be horrible for you to experience. You would not be able to be as free of anxiety as a baby is. But they are able to live without those chains. \n\nLiving in the present - free of the burdens of the future and of the past - sounds to me what yogis and spiritual advisors of Eastern religions see as the unattainable ideal of human existence. We would all be happier if we could experience each pain and joy in the present, with no expectation of what's to come. \n\nIt is the ideal way of living, and for a brief moment in our lives, we are able to. \n\nResponse B Author: ExploreMeDora\n\nResponse B: \nDo you think a newborn has the mental capacity to ponder these things and worry about these things like an adult in this situation would? They don't even know a language yet so they can not think, \"When will someone feed me?\" These things may upset the child in the moment, but I can not see these small problems contributing to a difficult life where the child does not look forward to the following days hardships. And that is really my main point: **A baby does not have a rough life because the baby has absolutely no understanding of life. The baby can not develop a perspective. It can only be upset in that moment or happy in that moment.**Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author NoTraceNotOneCarton's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Wii and of course Wiifit, you'll see a trend: These are all games that were either created FOR casual players, or very casual entries in an existing series. \n\nFor instance, Mario Kart Wii is easily less difficult than Double Dash, and certainly less than Mario Kart DS. Yet, when you compare the units sold with DS hitting 23.56 million versus the Wii version which sold 35.53 million, it's clear who the winner here is. \n\nSo, one thing is clear here: Nintendo has managed to tap into the far larger, pick-up-and-play casual gamer market. This is their major audience, currently, and it's earned them a large amount of money. \n\nNow, much of the hate being directed towards Smash 4 is that it's not \"competitive\" enough. Combos are hard/impossible to link, the physics are too slow and there's no L-cancelling, wavedashing or other related high-level techniques that can be used. However, Nintendo's current market is CASUAL, not COMPETITIVE. \n\nWe've already seen through the Gamecube to Wii transition that many, MANY more games are sold when they're catered towards the casual, not competitive, market. Furthermore, entries in a series that get simplified and made easier for casual players (Ex: Brawl, Mario Kart Wii) frankly just sell more. \n\nSo, from a business standpoint, why should Nintendo listen to all these naysayers? And why should the company care at all that a group of people who ultimately represent a tiny fraction of their current playerbase dislike the direction that the games are going, when the majority of the players don't care? \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: sibtiger\n\nResponse A: Competitive players may be a small market, but they have ripple effects far beyond their own sphere.  They get people excited about the game, they confirm the value of the game as a deep experience that won't get boring after playing for a few hours.\n\nRegardless, the existence of higher-level mechanics does not necessarily preclude the casual market.  Think of games like Magic: The Gathering, which has a massive casual market but also a very healthy competitive scene.  The two are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and the mechanical depth that is required for a good competitive scene also improves the casual experience.  I enjoyed Melee casually even with the existence of wave-dashing, L-cancels and the like that I never used.  But seeing people using those mechanics showed me how much depth and skill one could develop at the game.  Improving at the use of mechanics is core to what many people enjoy about games, even people who play casually, so having a lot of ways to improve yourself improves the experience for everyone.\n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: Xbox is also fully targeting the casual market, they only difference is there's more violence and better graphics. I have never seen any xbox games from truly target any hardcore audiences. PS4 seems to be mainly targeting casual market, but has nods to hardcore gamers too. At E3 they showed a new From Software IP and we KNOW those guys don't mess around. \n\nNintendo never used to be so casual, their games have been easy to pick up but usually were well made and had enough difficulty that they attracted both type of games. Anyone could play Smash Bros, but not everyone could play it at a competitive level. I think they're trying to return to that, and I say that's AWESOME. I mean look at Bayonetta 2, this is a game that's basically like Devil May Cry, and it has a lot of depth. I can't believe nintendo picked it up. Even though I'm completely uninterested in casual games if I see Nintendo return to it's roots and impress me with the new Zelda and a version of Smash Bros that worlds well competitively and they continue to get games like Bayonetta 2 then I might just be a customer once again.

In high school, my team had a tradition that everyone would shave down before the districts swim meet at the end of the year.  I wasn't competing my freshman year, but I shaved anyway as a matter of team spirit.  I found that bald skin feels fantastic and I haven't gone back since (this was 8 years ago).\n\nNow, I shave my head every day, and my legs about once a week (I skip winters because the extra insulation isn't too bad).  The smooth feeling of bare skin is fantastic and definitely worth the pain and discomfort to me.\n\n\nThey likely didn't voice anything, because most people view being hairless as the standard for women.  However, I bet if you stopped shaving, you  would start to get comments from men and likely a few rejections.  If you thin that is worth not having to bother with the shaving, then go for it, but every guy I know prefers hairless women.

I don't mind putting in too much more hard work than everyone else if it means I can compete with them.  However, I'm not sure if I can maintain that attitude about the extra training if I see everyone literally run past me, despite my training.  I even read that factors like determination and perseverance are genetically based as well.

Is genetics (I read that some of the sources say 20-80% of overall performance comes from genetics) really such a determining factor when I comes to sports (even at my age level)?  Does putting in that extra hard work even make a difference, is it even worth doing?  \n\nResponse A Author: moonflower\n\nResponse A: First of all, I totally agree that a person's genetic blueprint is one of the biggest factors in determining how well they will do at any given sport, but I will attempt to answer your statement: ''I hope someone can change my view to keep running and trying my best.''\n\nParticipating in sport does not have to be for the sole purpose of beating other people; your chosen sport can be enjoyed for the sheer pleasure of running cross-country, and keeping yourself fit and healthy ... and also, if you enjoy the competitive element with striving to improve times, you can compete against your own records, and feel that sense of achievement when you set a new 'personal best'.\n\nYes, it is very much worth it!\n\nResponse B Author: Ralkir\n\nResponse B: First off, I'd like to ask you a few questions. When's your birthday (the month), what city do you live in (population size), your race and the race of those who you are seeing get faster times than you. \n\nI start with those questions because there a specific phenomena that we know that are associated with those variables and athletic performance.\n\nThe first being the [Relative Age Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_age_effect). Basically what happens in this effect is the individuals born in the early months of a registration season are relatively older than those born in the later months. When this happens at a young age people mistake \"talent\" for just a child being older. Ex: An 8 year old born in January is relatively older than and 8 year old born in December. Then these children get more opportunities and better training because they are perceived as better. So what starts as just a difference in age, becomes a difference in training, which becomes a difference in performance.\n\nThe second effect is the Relative Birthplace Effect. Similar to the relative age effect, children who are born in basically more average or middle population cities have a statistically significant higher performance. This is because there are ample opportunities available to them in these cities, AND they can be noticed for their talent and not be overlooked by others. Contrast this with with small cities where you may not have the opportunities or big cities where you might be overlooked for other skilled individuals and they might receive better training. \n\nThe next effect occurs with stereotypes. Basically if one is told that a certain race or sex is better at something genetically, then the person who is supposedly worse will perform worse than if they did not have the knowledge that the other race or sex was better. Essentially if I was have you run a race and you had no prior knowledge that kenyan's were supposedly really good endurance runners, you would perform better than if I had you run a race against kenyan's and told you that they are better runners than you because of genetics.\n\nAll three of these things are effects that have been proven time and time again, and they contribute to an athletes performance. \n\nMoving on. Now, you mentioned the Kenyan runners. They are interesting aren't they, but have you looked closer at them? Kenya is relatively poor and to travel between any place they run. That's right they run all the time, they also run barefoot, and in order to get out of poverty they often work very had to become amazing runners to get money. In fact they have have entire schools dedicated to training these runners. \n\nNow what does barefoot have to do with anything you might ask? Well as it turns out using shoes has hindered our running ability. It is change our running technique and decreased efficiency, so it is very possible that because of how kenyan's run makes them better, not their genes. \n\nNow what does there culture have to do with their running ability you might ask? Well let's look at the [Boston marathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_winners_of_the_Boston_Marathon). Look from 1990 onwards. Absolutely dominated by kenyan's right? Well there is also a few Ethiopians in there as well. Ethiopia and Kenya are notorious for pumping out incredible endurance runners, and they border each other, how about that. So at this point you're probably thinking \"well that makes sense, they are so close they have similar genes, and that's why they run so fast.\" Well actually the opposite, those two countries contain people who's genes are MORE genetically diverse than ANY two white people on the planet. This is because human civilization started in africa, so the further you go from africa the less genetically diverse each population becomes. \n\nWhat I'm trying to point out to you here is that Kenyan's are such good runners, at least now, because of their culture, not their genes.\n\nLet's use another example, Canada. Canadians dominate at hockey. Does that mean Canadians are better genetically to play hockey, or is it perhaps because it's the biggest sport that is played up there. You can do it with pretty much any sport, if any one country dominates in any sport, their country places a huge emphasis on that sport. \n\nAnyway this has gotten long enough, there's more that I could say if you remain unconvinced, but I'll leave it at that for now. What I what to emphasize though is that, genetics, if it does play a role it is very minimal, and any differences you see are probably based on other reasons, a few cited above. Further based on all my education thus far I view genetics in sort of a roleplaying game fashion. Your genetics are your starting traits (high intellect, low strength etc.), but through leveling your character (or training), you can change your traits to be whatever you want them to be.

CMV.\n\nOp: \nBefore mentioning anything, I'd like to note that I am by no means demonizing the feminism movement or anything of that nature. Instead, I'm referring to allocation of jobs; many other industries (i.e, hard sciences) received a great boon after the feminist displays in 1910 and after. However, I believe that this shift of allocation has damaged the American education system, and have only been affirmed since I've began my last year as a student teacher.\n\nIn colonial times (1772 until the end of the 18th century, essentially) teachers were primarily male; you'd honestly be hard pressed to find a female as an educator in this time, but it certainly was plausible as being an educator wasn't seen as a career. Instead, most teachers used their experience in education as a stepping stone in order to advance to other jobs, such as medical jobs, law jobs, and religious jobs. \n\nThis primarily male system continued in place until about 1820-1830. However, because of the large amount of secretarial work that comes with being an educator, most teachers did not consider education as a primary profession and instead were siphoned into fields that I mentioned prior. This only became a greater issue with westward expansion of the United States, so additional educators were required to be adopted. It was around this time that the standard of female educators (which we still hold today, but no where near to the same degree) was formed. In addition, because of females being employed into the educational field, education began to be seen as a primary occupation (albeit one that only females pursued, similar to secretarial work). \n\nHonestly, this sort of educational system lingered until late 1800s-early 1900s, with it really picking up steam in 1910s. At this time, feminism as a movement is coming into full swing; the women teacher's rebellion followed along with it. Initially, this forms into having teachers unions, better benefits, and a gamut of other improvements.\n\nBut, after the feminism movement (mid and post 1930s) had largely made ground, female educators were (similarly to males) siphoned from education as a field and into hard sciences, medical, and law fields.  **Because of this siphoning, I believe that our education system experienced a crash and has never recovered from it.**\n\nMany of the educators at this time, who were siphoned, became prize winning biologists, physicians, chemists, doctors, and a gamut of other high caliber occupations. These individuals were, quick frankly, brilliant. At no other point of history after 1930s can we really say that education is filled with brilliant individuals, primarily because they were siphoned into other occupations (yes, males were in the 1700s, but as females adopted education as a field, education didn't experience a crash). Even today, the demographic of educators is no where near the intellectual caliber as at this time (and I say that going into education myself!). This is not to say there was not brilliant teachers, as I have the pleasure to interact with them on a near daily basis and refine my pedagogical skills, but we certainly do not have the prize winning hard science individuals teaching our children like we did in the 1920s and prior. \n\nI'll mention again that I'm not demonizing the feminism movement. After this movement, there were undeniable leaps and bounds in hard sciences, and those discoveries would not have been possible without those women leaving educational positions and trading in their chalkboards for lab coats. However, education has (and still is!) experiencing a drought that it honestly cannot recover from. In order to recover from this drought, you have to make education more attractive to those who are interested in pursing doctoral and master degrees. Education is always experiencing budget cuts, has an awful public image, and is an incredibly demanding job when considering its time:money ratio. \n\nI do not believe that it is possible to make education more attractive for these individuals who otherwise would pursue hard sciences, law, and medical fields. The only real reason I hear of individuals being passionate about education is from intrinsic value, and that's certainly not something that can be advertised to everyone (Come teach! You'll find meaning or something!). Unless there's some massive rework of the education system to make it more attractive (and, honestly, who sees that coming when education isn't a field lead by educators?), I see no real way education in the United States can recover from its current drought.\n\nCMV.\n\nResponse A Author: Not_Han_Solo\n\nResponse A: Your argument is factually incorrect.  Specifically, this part:\n\n\nJames J. Murphy spent his life researching pedagogical trends across centuries, and what you're describing happened, *kind of*, but not in the way you describe.  Read his work to get the whole story of what I'm saying from the horse's mouth.\n\nHistorically, men taught boys, and the pedagogical style was antagonistic.  A prof would drill his students, and then expect them to memorize every word for the next day's class.  This heavily masculist-focused educational system resulted in major clashes between students and teachers, who were universally despised, including several [armed student insurrections as recently as 1834 at Harvard](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/harvards-long-ago-student-risings/).  \n\nDuring this time period, women began to get formal educations, because a formal education was considered, by the extremely sexist standards of the Victorian era, to be an essential component for the creation of a marriageable upper- and middle-class woman, who would be expected to manage a household, ledgers, and sometimes a staff.  Because of those same sexist standards, however, it was grossly inappropriate to teach women in this way, and as a result they were taught using methods which we would recognize today.\n\nAnd then the West opened up.  With the Louisiana Purchase, the Eastern seaboard depopulated humongously, and no matter where you went, there was work for men to do who wanted it--if you were a settler, you were building or mining or herding or investing or building railroads, and if you stayed on the Eastern seaboard, you could get those lucrative jobs that many of the richer or middle-class men had vacated.  There simply weren't enough hands for the jobs, and teaching had always been an acceptable profession for women in the Victorian mold.\n\nSo, women stepped in where men had gone to seek their fortunes elsewhere, teaching being a less-than-profitable profession in the best of times.  And, since you teach others largely the way that you yourself were taught, these women taught their mostly male pupils in the same way that they had been taught, in a calm, non-confrontational manner.  Eventually, these boys grew up, and wouldn't put up with the bullshit that old-style profs at Harvard and such tried to make them put up with, and universities had to change rapidly and radically to survive.  Antagonistic teaching was gone, and gone forever, within a generation.\n\nWhat you're describing here:\n\n\nalso never happened.  First, women didn't make serious movement into the fields you describe for another 20-30 years.  Second, *after* that point in time, during the 1970s, we had hands down the best education system in the world.  Third, the observations you're making about prize-winning is not significant of the intelligence of the educators but of the comparative specialization you need in order to make discoveries today.  It required a lot more equipment and funding to discover DNA in 1962 than it did for Karl Landstiener to discover blood types for the identical nobel prize in 1930.\n\nResponse B Author: jnr_77\n\nResponse B: There is a glaring problem with this view. It presupposes that women (or anyone) would be educators simply because they wanted to *be* educators. Many probably were not. They were probably women interested in math and science and up until the fields of math and science were opened to women, the only way they could *sort of* work in the math and science field was to teach it to children.\n\nUnless you teach at the University level, I'm fairly certain that working as a full time teacher in primary and secondary schools means you will *never* make a significant advancement in the fields of science or math. Because you're too busy teaching kids.\n\nI think you're confusing the desire to teach with teaching being *the only option available.*  It's unlikely that people who are absolutely the top in their field, whatever that field is, are going to be interested in being *mere* teachers because teaching, by definition, means you're barely being involved in your chosen field. \n\nIt's disingenuous, and frankly a little too socialism-minded for my taste, to imply that women (or men) who are at the top of their fields be somehow made to remain teachers \"for the good of society\". \n\nThe fact remains that teaching is a low paying job, with no real opportunities for significant recognition, and hinders people from actually participating in making advancements in the field of choice.\n\nBeing good or interested in a subject does not automatically translate to being interested in teaching that subject to others.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Not_Han_Solo's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

The money he possesses, obtained from the profits of his many businesses is never re-invested. This is a huge blow to the economy, since by not being re-invested :\n\n- consumption is lowered and the money doesn't benefit companies and therefor the workers, who, by not getting paid higher, will spend less, thus creating even lower wages and unemployment. This vicious circle cripples the economy. \n\n- people and small businesses cannot loan it, this makes opening your own business very hard. And since Scrooge owns most of the businesses around, this could very much be an anti-competion technique. These shenanigans against entrepreneurship create unemployment and poverty.\n\nSecondly the amount of money he possesses in not clear. Amounts vary from *one multiplujillion, nine obsquatumatillion, six hundred twenty-three dollars and sixty-two cents* to *607 tillion 386 zillion 947 trillion 522 billion dollars and 36 cents* and sometimes *five multiplujillion, nine impossibidillion, seven fantasticatrillion dollars and sixteen cents*\n\nThis makes it very hard to assess the value of the currency, which could also be very fluctuant, an obsquatumatillion could become as worthless as a fantasticatrillion very quickly. This is very bad for the stock-exange market.\n\nAlso, people have calculated that based on it's size, his money bin could only contain $27 trillion. This could mean that he could be hiding the multiplujillions in overseas accounts, safe from the IRS.\n\nAlso, since there is only $77 trillion worth of things in the world, this means that, if the calculations on the money bin are correct, Scrooge owns 35% of the world's money. And since the world's second richest is Flinthead Glomgold who owns about he same amont, that means the population of the donald universe owns less than 30% of the world's riches, the two richest owning about 70%. \n\nSo in the duck universe, the richest 1% (or in this case 2,86x10^-8 % assuming there are 7 billion inhabitants in their world) swims around in their gold, rubbing it on their feathered skin whilst the rest of the population and the economy suffers.\n\nI believe Scrooge McDuck is a plague to the economy. CMV\n\n\n\n          I wish I could, like Scrooge, put my first gold at the end of a string and carry it around with me :)\n\n\nResponse A Author: fdar\n\nResponse A: There are two separate issues here:\n\n1) If the currency is actual gold, or backed by gold, then McDuck hoarding gold will severely restrict the monetary base, and in turn the money supply. This will indeed create a strong recessionary pressure in the economy. But note that this and the point you make in your edit cannot both be true. Releasing a ton of new found gold into the economy creates inflation by growing the monetary base; hoarding creates recessionary pressure by restricting it; both effects counteract each other. Either could be a problem, but both cannot be simultaneously.\n\nIn the case one of these effects is indeed the problem, this is really a problem with having a value-based currency as opposed to a fiat currency with a central bank that can better manage the money supply. While the effects on this situation for the economy may be severe, it doesn't seem fair to blame McDuck instead of the policy makers for refusing to abandon the gold standard.\n\n2) You mention the lack of profit re-investment as a problem. To ignore problem (1), let's assume that we have a fiat currency, but McDuck earns a large proportion of the world's GDP in profit and just let's it sit.\nThis may seem like a problem for the economy, but it isn't! Hoarding currency forever is, in macroeconomic terms, equivalent to setting some money on fire. And if I set some money on fire, the Federal Reserve can just print more! Printing money produces inflation, but somebody else burning it creates deflation. It may make the central bank's job trickier, but it shouldn't be a big issue.\n\nIf McDuck suddenly changes his behavior and starts spending a significant portion of his money, then inflation could become a problem. But as long as his behavior doesn't change very suddenly it wouldn't be. It does seem like 2 people holding 70% of the world's wealth may cause this issue to be too brittle for comfort: Maybe a high consumption tax with a high yearly limit would help here? Something that doesn't affect anybody, but would hit McDuck hard if he decides to spend a significant portion in a very short period of time...\n\nResponse B Author: PG2009\n\nResponse B: 1) His money is contained in gold, which has intrinsic value.  Hiding a lot of it away makes the rest of it much, much more valuable.\n\n2) His vault is a tourist attraction for Duckburg.  People have come from miles around to see it, just like building a giant statue.  That means tourist dollars flowing into Duckburg.\n\n3) When his vault gets robbed (which is *all the time*) there's always a bunch of random gold coins lying around which the robbers didn't bother to grab, since it was such a horde anyway.  Those extra coins often seep into the economy from scavengers, looters, etc.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author fdar's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I don't take new profile pictures of myself for months at a time. I don't take pictures of myself or my friends when we hang out. I don't take pictures when I'm on vacation nine times out of ten, and I don't take pictures of my family when I go to visit them unless they specifically ask me for one. \n\nI don't have any aversion to being on camera or anything - I know some people actively don't like being photographed, but that's not me. I just don't value it. It doesn't seem that important to me. I have a pretty good memory as it is so I don't tend to rely on the pictures of others to remember how something happened or that it happened. Additionally, I never really take the time to look through photo albums to reminisce. I have all my high school year books and I don't think I've opened any of them since the end of that school year. Meanwhile I have friends that consider taking pictures of stuff a hobby.\n\nHowever, it seems like a thing that \"normal\" people do.

Many feminists, including people in academics would say I'm a misogynist. But I disagree. I'm very much for equal rights of women, and I do think we live in a sexist society. However, I'm very much against what feminism has become in the last few years or so. I'll break down one by one on things I hate about feminism. \n\nFalse Rape accusations: Feminists claim this is a non-issue. And that you should NEVER EVER question the supposed victim, even though that means loss of freedom for the supposed perpetrator. \n\nRape 2.0(tm): Claims that if a woman has even 2 drinks, and a man has sex with her, he committed an act of rape. I can't find the exact article. But there was a guy at a college, who texted a girl for a booty call that happened to be drunk. The whole thing seemed consensual, as the girl did text the guy to bring a condom and invited him over. The guy gets kicked out of college for sexual assault. Even though they have both been drinking. Rape 2.0 also is apart of the new \"Yes means yes\" law in California. \n\nShirtgate: A guy who accomplished landing a probe on a comet gets attacked by feminists for wearing a tackey shirt. Was the shirt unprofessional? Sure. But that was not sexist or misogynistic, in fact, a female friend made the shirt for him. \n\nDonglegate: A guy gets fired for making a joke about dongles. \n\nFeminists are now running the government, and messing up men's lifes. Therefore, I'm an anti-feminist, but an egalitarian. So just because I'm against feminism, does NOT make me a misogynist.\n\nCMV\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: sillybonobo\n\nResponse A: It seems you have an almost cartoonish view of feminism. For instance, you'd have to look pretty hard to find a feminist who thought that false rape reports are a \"non-issue\" or that rape allegations should NEVER EVER be subject to due process of law.\n\nIt also reflects a one-sided view of the issues. You've got all these \"gates\" that are highly publicized issues while ignoring that these things come up because sexism, assault and mistreatment are still commonplace in this society. Also, many of the \"gates\" you cite are far less black and white than you seem to make them out. \n\nYou've created a strawman version of feminism that other people (rightly) don't share. So when you say that you are \"anti-feminist\" others will asume that you are against REAL feminism (ie- the support for fair and equal treatment of women in society). If you were against that form of feminism, you WOULD be a misogynist. But you aren't against feminism, you are against a bastardization of feminist principles.\n\nThat's the issue. Even feminists (myself included) agree that there are aggressive, unethical aspects and methods employed by certain individuals. However, to extrapolate from those to being \"anti-feminist\" is wrongheaded, for the same reason that people shouldn't be **anti-muslim** because of fanatics, **anti-environmentalist** because of eco-terrorists, or **anti-animal welfare** because of PETA. You shouldn't be **anti-feminism** because of extremists.\n\nResponse B Author: Aclopolipse\n\nResponse B: It seems that you refuse to support feminism because of the actions that some feminists have taken.  It's hardly fair to take the actions of some rabid online activists and apply their ideas to an entire movement.  Labels are important, though, as you have shown in your post - the feminist label used by the activists for these things you take issue with seems to be at the root of your attitude towards feminism.    \n\nBecause of that, I would recommend that you renounce your label of anti-feminist, in the interest of pursuing an egalitarian agenda.  Many of the people promoting egalitarian change in regards to men and men's issues (divorce court neutrality, gender neutral rape statutes, etc.) identify as feminists.  Every second spent working *against* feminism is a second that prevents you from working *with* these feminists in order to bring about change you can both agree on.\n\nOn the flip side, many people that work against egalitarian agendas happen to identify as anti-feminists.  The two major camps that come to mind are Red Pill types, who mourn the \"pussification\" of men that comes with a more egalitarian society, and traditionalists, who would rather men and women stick within yesteryear's gender roles.  If you're bothered by the prospect of being associated with these people when you proclaim yourself as anti-feminist, then congratulations - you know how the ideological kin of Margaret Sanger feel about the judgments of Feminism you raised in the OP.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author sillybonobo's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Anakin Skywalker was refused a proper life with his wife because apparently \"attachment is the path to the Dark Side\", but we know this is false - The Altisian Jedi were pure in their light and had proper families. Hell, Ki Adi Mundi, Jedi Council member had 5 wives.\n\nFurthermore, the whole Jedi Order accepted clone troops, and while they might have felt morally wrong about it, they did nothing (with the exception of Bardan Jusik and Etain Tur-Mukan). All they did was play along. Even mongrel officers like Gilad Pellaeon and Hallena Devis did not like the expendable treatment of clone troops.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, the Jedi were not guardians of the light - they were guardians of the crumbling, corrupt Republic. They overthrew governments in Cestus, Gaftikar for their own profits. Cestus, to simply prevent Separatist control without asking the citizens' opinions, and the Republic wasn't attacking Gaftikar planet so much for the war effort or to help the Marits, but rather as a favor to the Shenio Mining corporation, who were interested in the gaining greater economical control over the planet. The Jedi were complicit in this - even Etain was. There was no opposition to this, be it by force or by discussion.\n\nEven though the Chancellor had championed Jedi causes repeatedly, no Jedi could see that it was his inept decisions that were causing the war to be drawn out and they never opposed his decisions - not even Yoda did.\n\nSince the Jedi always failed to see this, they acted against their core values and thus deserved to fall.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: sonofaresiii\n\nResponse A: Nearly every thing the Jedi Council was doing wrong could be traced back to manipulation from Palpatine/Sidious/the Sith. IMO that's not \"deserving\" to fall, it's just the first steps of being taken down. The Jedi had kept order for-- how many millenia?-- without anyone ever needing or wanting to revolt.\n\nAs far as keeping celibate goes, that's a pretty common religious order, so it shouldn't be that big a deal. If you're going to bring the EU into it, things get way more wonky, but at the least we can say with that *extra* information, we now don't have enough information to pass judgment. Maybe only members of the Jedi Order can take wives? Maybe there are certain conditions that need to be met?\n\nAt the end of the day, I think you're right that the Jedi Order was doing more harm than good-- *but* I don't think they deserved to fall, I think they already were. What they deserved is a hero/savior to free them from the evil manipulation, what they got instead was a powerful warlord who took them down.\n\nLet's look at it this way. In the US, we've had shitty Presidents, right? Does that mean our government deserves to fail because one guy in control is ruining things? Do we seek national revolution any time our leader does something wrong? No. We get rid of the person doing the wrongdoing and do our best to right the wrongs that he made happen.\n\nResponse B Author: ymeel\n\nResponse B: In my opinion the jedi order were by no means Jedi. They were white siths that's what they were. They reasoned in absolutes all the time. They used their powers to force their opinions on peoples and they were unblanced peoples through and through. Only sith thing they didn't do was to use their emotions to channel the force. Using a different discipline doesn't justifies automatic death penalty\n\nI like to mark the difference between sith and jedi, not by the dark and white distinction, but on their fundamental points of view on life.\n\nA sith will think in absolutes and can't be reasoned with.\nA jedi is open minded and tries to reason first. Because that's what adults do, life is not black and white.\nThat's how I judge a good guy from a bad guy in real life anyways.\n\nNow let's apply this. Who was a sith and who was a jedi? Answer: Qui-gon, Anakin and Luke were Jedi. The rest proved to be a sith, white or black. Qui-gon was a clearer Jedi than Anakin, that's for sure. Anakin was pretty dark. Luke is pretty grey. He force choked and killed a lot of peoples, but always tried reasoning first and was a pretty good guy overall.\n\nSee here's the difference. Qui-Gon tried to reason peoples, even the jedi council. Anakin tried to reason the emperor and wanted to until the very end of his jedi career (Windu's death) and Luke, when he was a jedi, went to jabba, went to Vader and the emperor, always to reason with them. The whole rest of them: You don't share my point of view?! Pew Pew! Die! Die! I'm white thus I'm good! Don't touch that titties Skywalker, it'll turn you \"bad force\" and I'll have to kill you on the spot!\n\nTl;dr: Vader did not restore balance to the force by balancing the number of jedi and siths. He just (almost) single handedly killed every single sith, finally leaving some space for the jedi and some effing balance.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author sonofaresiii's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

One is that they are a business, they need to pursue stories that will have a large readership. The news wasn't always conducted in this manner, but today that's what we have to deal with. Two is that people have an abiding love for Mandela. Doubtless some news editors knew him, some reporters were inspired by him, and they know their readers adore him so they feel it is their duty to keep everyone as informed as possible.\n\nSecond, I think most people who read these stories are trying to come to grips with the fact that he will probably not make it through the day. He was a larger-than-life figure, and there will be billions of people mourning his passing. I've heard him described as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln combined to the South African people, and the national father. If your actual father were dying, you would certainly want to hear up-to-the-minute news on his condition. I think it is somewhat similar.\n\nTl;dr: The news organizations know that their stories will be read, and people love Mandela.\n\nResponse B Author: Lostprophet83\n\nResponse B: \nNo, its an event upon which the hopes of an entire nation hing. Mandela is his country's Martin Luther King Jr. Imagine that instead of the 60, the US had been segregated until 1994. Blacks, Whites, Asians, and 'Natives' were segregated in schools,beaches, and even where they lived. The mostly white government would even dictate where you would live in a city based on your race. \n\nThen imagine that one day it all changed. Imagine that one of the great black leaders who had fought against segregation for 30 years was president! Mix the election of Obama with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in ONE DAY. The 1994 election meant that Apartheid was ended, and there was a black president. You think African Americans were excited over Obama? This is nothing compared to the election of Mandela.\n\nSo the fact that he is dying is a pretty big deal. For South Africa, they don't want a morbid update on the deterioration of a political leader. They are holding vigil for a man who represents the greatest moment in their history.

CMV\n\nOp: I hold this view because I don't see how ticket scalping is good for anyone other than the few scalpers trying to make money. The price of a ticket is not going to be lower when scalped (excluding rare overselling) and the increase in price only hurts people. Ticket scalping is just rent extraction that only hurts the consumer trying to purchase tickets as individuals.\n\nSince there is only a loss to general utility and no gain in a rent extraction event like ticket scalping, making it illegal makes a lot of sense to me, why shouldn't it be? CMV\n\nResponse A Author: convoces\n\nResponse A: I agree that ticket scalping has no or negative value. However, in an attempt to change your view, I would say that adding legislation is not the way to prevent scalping. Basically, the transaction that occurs is usually between the legitimate customer and the performer. Scalping occurs when the scalpers try to make a margin by inserting themselves into the middle. \n\nScalping generally hurts the legit consumer because prices go up, but sometimes it helps the consumer if the scalper overpurchased. \n\nThis generally helps the performer, since all of the tickets get purchased, but it can hurt the performer if they lose audience due to the scalper taking too much of a cut.\n\nSince it's not an absolute good or bad for either the performer or legit consumer, I don't think that this should be regulated by legislation, which is really hard to enforce, and if it's hard to enforce it will not deter scalping. It would also require resources to enforce.\n\nHowever, I do agree that we should solve the problem, since scalpers suck... just not with legislation. This can be done easily by matching identity with the purchaser at the venue, which some performances now do. I believe that this decision should be up to the performer and possibly the venue, with those people knowing themselves and their audience the best so they can decide how to best address the problem (some artists do this already) and does not require legislative action that would probably not be very effective in any case. Hopefully this changes your view!\n\nResponse B Author: EricTheHalibut\n\nResponse B: Scalping helps some acts like Britney Spears and the like, which have very expensive tickets anyway. The existence of some tickets being sold for ludicrous prices makes people think that the merely excessive prices charged by the venue are not so bad (a bit like \"compare\" prices in some shops).Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author convoces's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

As you all know, our muscles atrophy, our eyes get weaker, and many more side effects of space life are yet to be discovered. For the record, I'm an optimist and wish we could travel light-years, but it's just not plausible. We can't have babies in space, I saw a Vsauce video showing all the deformities there would be. The fastest moving object in space is Voyager 1 at 70,000 mph. I read in Bill Bryson's \"A short history of nearly everything\" that at that rate it would take us 25,000 years to reach the Kuiper Belt, which is all the debris circling our solar system. Which we would then have to either navigate through or have a ship sturdy enough to withstand meteors being flung at the side at breakneck speeds. All of human history (practically) has taken place in the last 2,000 years, so 25,000 is a long flight, which would require us to reproduce in space. The ONLY way we could escape, is if something is invented, like a gravity chamber. Or wormholes. We can't \"planet hop\" either because after Mars nothing habitable is within reach. This is something I think about often. I wish I could smile about humans eventually branching out, but the odds are... we will go extinct right here on Earth (and Mars). The post about the new habitable planet on /r/science is what prompted me to make this post. \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: garnteller\n\nResponse A: Well, first of all, there's some exciting research into warp technology going on: http://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive-possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html\n\nBut even if there isn't, a lot of your objections can be overcome.\n\nFirst, many of your problems involve zero-G.  But it's easy to simulate gravity via rotation on a large spacecraft, as scifi writers and scientists have been discussing for years.  \n\nNext, the Kuiper Belt is donut-shaped, in the plane of our solar system.  Just go outside the plane, and no worries about whacking into things.\n\nYes, the time is an issue, but to think that our technology, which has advanced tremendously will somehow stop in the 1970's propulsion systems behind Voyager is pretty pessimistic.  There are many technologies that could make it possible to travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light (which of course will also make time pass more slowly for those on the craft).\n\nNow, I'm not sure if we have a reason *why* we would do this beyond \"because we can\".  But assuming we don't destroy ourselves in the next 1000 years, I can't imagine that we wouldn't have the ability, if not the will.\n\nResponse B Author: DogtorPepper\n\nResponse B: 1) We can simulate gravity by having a spinning spaceship/chamber due to centripetal force. \n\n2) It's likely that we achieve near light speed by the end of the century with technologies like nuclear rockets, antimatter rockets, solar sails, etc. This means we can visit our closest star in about 4-5 years.\n\n3) Even if we wanted take 25,000 year trip, humans might not need to reproduce in space if you are traveling close to light speed. This is because of Einstein's theory of relatively. Time moves slower the faster you go meaning the astronauts can possibly make a 25,000 year journey within their lifetimes\n\n4) There's a small chance we could planet hop within our solar system.

However, I have always been unsure as to whether the recognition of privilege should have any special effect on my behavior. Specifically, I believe that you should treat everyone equally regardless of sex, gender, race, or anything else, and that even if privilege did not exist, you should still treat all people equally.  In short, when it comes to my actions, I don't see any situation in which being aware of privilege affects my behavior in a manner different than that of the desire to treat everyone equally.\n\nResponse A Author: unsettlingideologies\n\nResponse A: I am with you on one level: I think that acknowledging privilege in itself is completely useless. \"Okay, I have unearned privileges as a man. What do I do with that?\" In practice, the more important step is what you are taking right now, figuring out what to do once you acknowledge that privilege. I have two immediate thoughts about this. \n\nFirst, by acknowledging that you have certain privileges, you are implicitly acknowledging that there are others who do not have access to those same privileges. Consequently, when someone who does not have access to particular privileges is speaking about their experience, it is important for you to listen to them and recognize that their understanding of that experience may be different than yours. For example, if a poor person of color is talking about their experience of police violence and says that they don't think police make their neighborhoods safer, you should really hear what they say and not dismiss it because it's not your experience.\n\nMy second thought is that what to do [with the knowledge that you have access to certain privileges] often depends on the situation. For example, as a man in the classroom who is aware of the ways in which society tends to privilege my voice and my opinion, I try to be aware of how much conversation space I take up. I also try to notice if any of my female classmates are struggling to get into the conversation and will sometimes say \"I think so-and-so is first\" or something like that. That's a way of using my male privilege to disrupt the unequal structure.

I disagree because she has full custody, and should have just left.\n\nOp:  I recently read this case on a legal website and decided to read the whole thing and it kind've irked me. The court may not have made the wrong decision per se, but Maybe the petitioner messed up by even going to the court for permission at all.\nhttp://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/AppellateCourt/2012/1stDistrict/1111916.pdf\n\nBasically, a divorced woman with \"full custody\" of her children wanted to move to a different state for financial and educational reasons.. Respecting the divorce decree that granted her ex-husband visitation rights with his kids, but no custody, she petitioned the court in Illinois,USA,where they lived ,to give her leave to relocate. She outlined a new visitation plan and told the court all the details of why she wanted to move and how it could be arranged to keep her kids in regular contact with their father and the Illinois side of their family. The petition was ultimately denied by the court and on an appeal because the father made claims that the move would obstruct his decreed visitation time, and give the woman too much control over the nature of the visitation with the kids.  If there was joint custody I would be more inclined to concur with the courts but in this case I cry foul ball. \n\n I'm not sure I disagree with the courts' decisions rationally because they weighed the circumstances pretty solidly, except maybe I don't see how there can be any objection to the woman, with full custody, retaining control over the nature of the visitation with her kids; nor do I understand how the fact that the father couldn't afford to keep up visitation in another state should become the mother's burden especially when she is willing to help fund the continued visitation; and finally also why they didn't factor in the reduced visitation sending the eldest child to a boarding institution might cause on all parties.The kids are all relatively advanced in age, and I am not an opponent of father's rights, but I do think the outcome was unfavorable in this case especially considering the situation with the house being already sold on the market. \n\nPersonally I think her actual mistake was asking the courts for permission and trying to work out an arrangement. Anytime you involve the courts and the party appears to object you reduce your chance of getting your way down to 50/50 who else sees it that way? Sometimes, especially with family matters, Its better to DO and apologize than to ask for permission and be denied.\nI'm sure there are lawyers and lawful-good persons who might  disagree and I want to hear from you so I can better understand the ramifications of my rationale(ie what I would have done.)\nWhich is to say if you have full custody of your children and you want to move to a different state in the U.S. just leave. The IL court would have no jurisdiction in NJ, and you have full custody so it couldn't be considered kidnapping. If he makes too much trouble I'm sure he'd have had to go to court in Jersey with his visitation order to demand visitation rights be respected(or get custody) but thats all he could do is ask them to grant him a similar order in NJ. Mission accomplished. He should get his money right so he can keep up with them, not be allowed to use the divorce decree to encumber the ex-wife's right to choose what U.S. state she wants to raise her kid's in. She also screwed up by selling her house before the petition was granted. \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: OFF_THE_DEEP_END\n\nResponse A: A child with divorced parents who can't cooperate ends up having three parents: father, mother, and judge.\n\nThe judge represents the State first, and the interests of the child second. (It's the law that directs the judge to consider the interests. And the law comes from the State.)\n\nThese two folks here, the mother and father, can't agree on what's right for their kids. And the State steps in and makes the decision for the kids. Its eventual decree is as binding as the law itself.\n\nIf you don't like it, don't ever have kids with someone you can't trust to represent your interests.

CMV\n\nOp: Hello reddit.\n\nI find myself with a frustrating predicament. I have a large number of friends, primarily female, who have over the last five years really started getting into comic books and superhero culture. I've personally been a comic book nerd since I was a kid, so sharing this culture with my friends (and my girlfriend) has been a wonderful and liberating experience.\n\nHowever, I have a small irritation. A few of my friends are very vocal about mainstream comic industries and their portrayal of women in their works - and their constant barrage of anger is having a persuasive effect on my other friends. Even though in most cases I do agree that women need a better representation in comics (Which would help develop more interesting characters and plots), I will admit their opinions sometimes feel like an intrusion. That being said, I have no real problem with the eventual shift from current male-targeted depictions to a more gender neutral archetypes. Women are currently over sexualized in comics. I strongly believe that, due to the shift in demographics, continued male-centered marketing will prove to be an extremely unwise business move and will force the big name comic producers to level their tone a little bit. I feel this change is inevitable if the medium wishes to stay afloat, and as a whole will be beneficial to everyone. \n\nHere is the issue: People like [this](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-pbs-superheroes-the-neverending-battle-documentary-fanboys-20130807,0,2640758.story) and [this](http://observationdeck.io9.com/mark-millar-and-todd-mcfarlane-ladies-comics-arent-f-1095912572) are making gender issues a constant topic in the comic fandom. And while, once again, I do not wholly disagree with the general sentiments portrayed, these sort of incidents whip my female friends into a frothing torch-and-pitchfork style frenzy. Causing them to decry the industry as a whole, and demand change instantly otherwise they will forsake comics all together. I feel this is a knee-jerk reaction to marketing, and that a knee-jerk response by comic producers would be not only inappropriate but bad for the industry as a whole. It will alienate a lot of the core base of readers keeping the paper/ink industry afloat, not necessarily due to misogyny (though I'm sure it will play a part for some people), but simply due to radical change.\n\nI'm not anti-feminist (said every male-privilege beneficiary ever), I just like comics how they are. I've liked comics how they have been for the last twenty years. Yes women are overly sexualized, but men are over-idealized in romance novels. Obviously there have been some stupid and downright offensive alterations and incidents in recent history (I\u2019m looking at you DC. Starfire did not deserve that), but as a whole comics continue to be a male-targeted market. I am not opposed to change, but I strongly believe that a change in marketing will not, and should not, happen overnight. Enough people flipped out when the new 52 hit the shelves, and do you remember how maturely people handled [Peter Parker being replaced](http://www.webcitation.org/614OyqzPr) ?  A PC coup would be a disaster, and constantly throwing these matters into the face of the industry only foments anger and resistance to the very change that is desired. These women I know started liking comics despite the tone they present, and I don't believe it needs to be radically addressed simply because they happened to change their minds. No one wants women to stop reading what they want to read, but I don't appreciate being made to feel guilty just because I am doing the same. \n\nFeminists who have a complaint need to wait for the inevitable change, or stop reading the comics which offend them in favor of other, more gender neutral publications (they do exist). An economic vote is the best way to contribute to the change of a consumer industry.\n\nHelp me out reddit, I think my opinion is missing something. CMV.\n\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: I can tell you directly and personally why vocal commentary can be incredibly effective in a field like this. I work as a designer in video games, a field I'm sure you know has many of the same gender issues as comic books. And in the past five years, there has been a huge uptick in discussion of gender and sexism in gaming. Now, I read a lot, and so I read the blogs and columns and articles about gender issues in gaming, and they all considerably opened up my perspective; the thing about gaining empathy is it only works if people express their beliefs and emotions. As a result of this, I realized that there were aspects of previous products I'd worked on that had unfortunate gender implications, and I worked hard on all subsequent ones to correct that. The recent games I've worked on have received praise for their strong, nuanced female characters. If all those women hadn't spoken up, their message wouldn't have reached me, and I wouldn't have changed. And an economic vote would have been vastly slower, because the previous titles I worked on sold just fine.\n\nThe thing that you're missing is that these women speaking up and pointing out sexism aren't doing it expecting a sea-change, 180 degree shift in the industry overnight. They're doing it so that, bit-by-bit, comic writers and artists will become aware of the flaws in their medium, and work to correct it. Their agitation and activism is precisely what will provoke the 'gradual change' you're looking for.\n\nAlso, the argument that 'an economic vote is the best way to change a consumer industry' only works if the people making the economic vote are the primary consumers of the product, and if the protest is a unified movement. If men protested tampons by not buying them, it wouldn't change much about the feminine hygiene industry. Loud, outspoken activism and criticism is actually often much more effective at effecting change.\n\n\nResponse B Author: 7Architects\n\nResponse B: People complain about products they don't like. Sometimes if enough people complain changes are made. Unless all the feminists ban together and storm comic book shops with torches I don't think it is fair to call it a PC coup. No one is being forced to change their comics at gunpoint. The changes to the comic industry are being created by a sustained message that the depiction of women is deeply flawed and that if this image doesn't change the PR damage will translate into lost sales. \n\nThis argument reminds me in a lot of ways of people who don't like gay pride parades. People always complain that gay people are hurting their own struggle by being very loud and very public about who they are and what they want. At first glance it does seem true. Footage of gay pride parades is often used by conservatives to discredit the gay rights movement. Even though this position makes intuitive sense we can see that very public very unpopular (with the majority) demonstrations seem to work to move issues forward. The reason rants about sexist comics and gay pride parades work is because the absolute best thing you can do for a social justice movement is to expose it and give it attention. the status quo thrives on silence and encouraging feminists  to just shut up and buy fewer comics would only serve to slow down the pace at which comics and other geek media change.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author [deleted]'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: I define rape alarmism as the feminist initiative to spread awareness of rape, through statistics, posters, and campaigns like \"Don't Be That Guy\". I believe that this initiative harms men more than it helps women because of these reasons:\n\n1. Making everyone more aware of rape does not stop rapists. In fact, spreading around the fact that 33% of women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime can be viewed by some that rape is okay because it is so prevalent in our society. So instead of fighting rape culture, making everyone hyper-aware of rape in fact perpetuates the culture we are trying to fight.\n\n2. Rape alarmism paints men as violent, horny monsters controlled by their penises, who will stop at nothing to have sex. When women see rape as a global pandemic, and are afraid that a rapist may be right around the corner, their view of men in general is affected. For example, some women get scared whenever a big, tough man gets visually angry, when in fact said man may be very nonviolent, just frustrated. When men are nice to women and do them favours, it is seen as the man is just doing it to have sex, when in fact the man may just be a nice person. Many people believe that single men can't have friends who are female, because he will be too preoccupied trying to have sex with her. These are all very real views of men that are perpetuated by rape alarmism.\n\n3. Rape alarmism has existed for a long time, and has been used as anti-black propaganda during the reconstruction era of the USA. The goal was was to strike fear into white women by painting African American men as brutes. Now, the same thing is happening, but to all men, not just African Americans. Now, all men are seen as brutes, which is counter to the efforts feminists have made to break down gender roles.\n\n4. Feminists' efforts should be focused on empowering women, not on rape awareness and telling men not to rape. Campaigns like \"Don't Be That Guy\" assume that without instruction, all men are inherently rapists, so the solution is telling them to stop. Having one's entire gender labeled off as potential rapists doesn't make a person of that gender more likely to support that campaign, and certainly wouldn't deter him if he actually *was* a rapist. The way that we will move away from rape culture is by empowering women; make society see women not as objects but as people who have the right to not be taken advantaged of, not by taking shots at men and shaming the entire gender because of the relatively small percentage who actually *are* rapists.\n\nBecause of all of this, feminists should stop focusing their efforts into rape awareness because the paranoia it creates harms men more than it helps women.\n\nResponse A Author: dogtatokun\n\nResponse A: \nOne of the biggest problems of rape is that so much of it goes unreported. Why? Because victims overwhelmingly blame themselves, feel shame, or don't recognise that what happened to them was wrong. So the awareness helps exactly that issue. By bringing it into the open, it is recognized clearly as a problem, and it makes the victims more likely to come forward. There are many, many online reports of women who were raped who did not go on to report their rapist due to pressure, and how they were handled by police, friends, and entourage. While rape happens to everyone, there is a very strong stereotype that it happens to women who were doing something wrong themselves. Who put themselves into a bad situation. Who chose to take a risk. By far the most important thing in a trial, is the character of the victim. Like a victim of rape doesn't deserve to be treated respectfully if she slept around, did drugs, or was a prostitute. Rape has to be clearly called for being a crime that the perpetrator is 100% guilty of.\n\nRape alarmism has existed for a long time, and has been used as anti-black propaganda during the reconstruction era of the USA. The goal was was to strike fear into white women by painting African American men as brutes. Now, the same thing is happening, but to all men, not just African Americans. Now, all men are seen as brutes, which is counter to the efforts feminists have made to break down gender roles.\n\nIt does the complete OPPOSITE. By making it a point of saying rape is a choice, it is combating that deeply rooted idea that men are simply walking penises with no self control, and that it is the women who are gatekeepers, and who are responsible for covering themselves up, and not putting themselves in situations where they will be raped. See very backward societies, like highly religious sectant muslims. Women have to cover up, because men cannot control themselves if they see a baren ankle. Men are helpless, and women are vulgar and sexual inherently. \n\nThis culture not only harms women, it harms men because it claims men are unthinking brutes, and if a woman is raped, it's her own fault for wearing X, going to Y, or saying Z. It's the fault of the woman for not having protected herself against men who are just men. While the point of the campaigns are exactly that rape is a choice a person makes, and not something that happens. And that a woman who is raped did not bring it on herself by doing a certain thing.\n\n\n\nNope. If anything, it's trying to stir up the good guys into being more harsh with any people in their entourage who might rape. Guess what, most people who rape are not strangers hiding in a bush. It's people who know the victim, who are dating the victim, or are related to the victim. Often you get an aquaintance do it, and then you as a woman, are faced with either being that bitch who puts everybody's friend in jail because she woke up and regretted her drunken one night stand. So many times the rapist has friends and family stand by him telling the victim it's not fair to put him in prison for a misunderstanding. Everybody makes a mistake once, doesn't he? *puke*\n\nWell, that's exactly the kind of thing you want to make moral, stand up men aware of. If your guy friend takes a blacked out women to his room to have sex with her, you should feel repulsed by that. \n\nAdditionally, men have to be aware that there are situations in which their own actions can blur the lines, even without realising. As a woman, if a man is sitting blocking your way, and kisses you while holding your face, you cannot move, and if he is physically imposing, and you did not want to kiss him, you know what the most common reaction is? Freezing. Sitting there like a frozen duck, and letting the guy do whatever. It's not calmly asking the guy to back off, it's not yelling NO. It's often being so intimidated that you just retreat in your head and try to stay there until whatever happens is over.\n\nMaking men aware how important it is to get express, freely given consent is a huge problem.\n\nImagine if a guy takes a girl home, and he says let's do X. She says no, shrugs, and looks down. He says  ''c'mon''. She says ''no, I don't want to'' and gets even more flustered about it. At this point, what do you think it means if he keeps asking? With many women, not respecting their no to back off, and asking on and on will at some point get a yes. It's not a real yes. It's the result of badgering, and cornering a person who may have grown up to be submissive, and accomodating to men. It's wrong, but a lot of men aren't aware of that. For them, as long as you don't forcefully get something, asking 100 times for it is ok. \n\n \n\n\nResponse B Author: jacenat\n\nResponse B: 1. Making everyone more aware does not stop rapists, but it does help cartographing in more detail how many persons are raped and how it happened. This should lead to refinement in counter strategies. Also it liberates victims to know they are not alone. Rationalizing an assault on you to fit in society is still a problem as it takes the assault of the radar of authorities/doctors. It's important to know that rape is very prevalent even in developed countries. Everyone should know that.\n\n2. **\"are afraid that a rapist may be right around the corner, their view of men in general is affected.\"** This is indeed an issue. **\"or example, some women get scared whenever a big, tough man gets visually angry, when in fact said man may be very nonviolent, just frustrated. When men are nice to women and do them favours, it is seen as the man is just doing it to have sex, when in fact the man may just be a nice person. Many people believe that single men can't have friends who are female, because he will be too preoccupied trying to have sex with her.\"** These are socially constructed. Both physical strength and financial resources did lay in the hand of men until just a few decades ago and still do so in many regions of the planet. It will probably take another generation for this to degenerate into a romantic fantasy. I can't see it being connected to rape alarmism however.\n\n3. Being from the heart of Europe, I can't comment too well on that. Here the view on men is not as exaggerated as it is portrayed by you. Classic gender roles do break up as both sexes mix more heavily in the workplace here. Men are not seen as brute, and women are not seen as fragile.\n\n4. **Campaigns like \"Don't Be That Guy\"** to be honest, I also have issues with this campaign, becuase it seems more to blame than to educate. But there is a need to educate. Current legislation regulates that rape is non consentual sex. Boys and girls need to be told that sex needs to be wanted from both sides to be legal. Especially in young ages this is mostly (but not exclusively) a problem for boys. In adults, both sexes need to remember that fact. Do not have sex with someone who isn't sure if he/her wants to have sex with you.\n\n5. I feel you actually missed something. Rape alarmism concentrates heavily on female rape while male rape still exists. This actually raises the bar to come forward as a male and report a rape. IMHO the whole discussion should be hold as sex neutral as possible. Both genders are affected (even if not equally) and leaving out one is discrimination.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author dogtatokun's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: Around my senior year of high school (2009-ish) I became quite interested in public events and foreign relations and wanted to become more knowledgeable about how the United States compared to the other nations without the star-spangled bias you get from public school and fox news. Not too long after that I was exposed to 9/11: In Plane Site as well as others, and the copious amounts of conspiracy videos of YouTube. As someone of above average intelligence and a skeptic by nature I have never taken conspiracy theories too seriously, as many rely on sparse circumstantial evidence but for whatever reason this feels different.\n\nMy main reasons for suspecting foul play in order of importance:\n\n1. BUILDING 7!?!?\n2. The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed implying a coordinated severance of support beams along with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns.\n3.

Im swearing into the Navy on Wednesday and this is the my biggest cause of apprehension about joining the war machine so hopefully one or more of you fine people can CMV!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisclaimer: First Post so I apologize in advance if I am in violation of any rules or protocol\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Llamarama\n\nResponse A: 1) ALL of the buildings in the complex were damaged by massive buildings falling on them, building 7 just got the worst of it. IIRC, building 7 fell about an hour after 1 and 2, and firefighters had already evacuated because they could tell it was on the verge of collapse.\n\n2) If you watch video of the towers falling, you can see they started at where the planes hit. There were several stories above where the planes hit, so that's a lot of weight falling at once onto the rest of the building, which caused a chain reaction of each floor falling into the next. The building wasn't built for that kind of stress, which caused the whole thing to collapse pretty quickly. As far as the cut beams you were talking about, there were only a few of them, and truthers cherry picked them out.\n\n3) When the towers fell, each floor sandwitched into the next. There's a lot of air in between each floor, and it has to go somewhere. the easiest escape out is weakened windows (the explosions coming out of windows some truthers like to point out) or down the stairwell, which ended in the basement. I never heard about a burned janitor, but that air coming into the basement would be really hot.\n\n4) Thermite is just a mixture of a metal powder and a oxidizer, typically aluminum and iron oxide. You don't need a chemical reaction to make it, just to physically mix it (mythbusters made a bunch by putting the two powders in a cement mixer). You'd find a lot of that stuff mixed together when 2 100+ story buildings collapse.\n\nIn addition to that, an inside job would require weeks of work, including cutting away walls to wrap the support beams with explosives or thermite (which unless channeled, only burns down btw). Many of the over 30,000 people that worked there every day must have noticed that, but no one did.\n\nResponse B Author: trefitch\n\nResponse B: \nWhat exactly was the benefit of these unknown insiders destroying building 7? It accomplished nothing compared to the Twin Towers and Pentagon in terms of boosting public support for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the only other theory I can think of was that there was some sensitive data stored there. In which case, wouldn't these \"insiders\" have a much easier job sneaking in and destroying the data rather than destroying the entire building?\n\n\nThe buildings fell at free fall speed because they were being piledriven by all the building on top of it. Think about how much weight was at and above where the two planes hit. How many tons of metal, concrete, etc. came down the minute the collapse started? That much weight is pretty much unstoppable.\n\n\nHave you seen the amount of wiring and explosives that normal demolitions companies use to destroy a building? How much time it takes to set that stuff up? How much more time it would take to set it all up but have it all be perfectly hidden? How could these \"insiders\" sneak into the building undetected by security personnel and janitorial staff and do all of this work? Work by the way that was **impossibly durable** because it all survived the impact of a jetliner and the subsequent fire.  How do you design a demolition project (which is by it's very nature, prone to explosion) to withstand the impact of a plane and a massive fire?\n\n\nA 45 degree angle cut only really makes sense on a vertical support, so how did they attach thermite to a vertical support? Even nano-thermite takes considerable time to burn through a support that thick, so whatever you're using to attach the thermite is just going to burn and fall off long before the I-beam is cut through.\n\n\nI suspect this was probably the result of debris falling down an elevator shaft or something similar, but I've got a more important point:\n\nWhat would these noises mean? The buildings toppled from the top down and once the collapse started, Atlas himself couldn't hold that shit up.\n\n\nA building falling with such force pulverized almost everything in it's path, including rusty stuff and stuff made out of aluminum.\n\n\nHere's the kicker though: **how could they have possibly gotten away with it?** Breaking the story would make you a national hero and celebrity, so how much money would it take to buy you off? Now take that amount and multiply it by the number of people that had to be accomplices. Dozens of demolitions *experts* (and I mean they have to have a demolition superpower to pull off this job), Security and Janitorial staff that took a bribe to effectively let their friends/coworkers die, guys willing to kill themselves for the job. Add onto that all the people that found out working on the official report of what happened and every guy at Popular Mechanic that learned the dark truth.\n\nAnd every single one of them took the bribe? Not only did they take the bribe, but none of them have come out about it yet? The NSA couldn't even get away with it's spying operation when it wasn't hurting anybody and had noble intentions (wrong and an invasion of privacy, but still...noble intentions); but you think that a group could get away with murdering 5,000 civilians? The first person to come out would be a celebrity and a hero. He'd be on talk shows, have book and movie deals, and get his name written in history. But not a single person is willing to do that?\n\nTo propose that 9/11 was an inside job raises so many questions, and I can practically guaranty any answers you give are just going to raise even more questions.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Llamarama's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

People on both sides were giving quality reasons about the economy, living standards and so on. That all seems good but as a whole shouldn't we be decentivizing jobs that need a minimum wage. \n\n\nShouldn't we instead be incentivizing jobs that need more skill and education. I think the best way to incentivize would be to remove or reduce the minimum wage. If someone knows that they can't live based on their pay from a fast-food joint then they'll have even more incentive to get an education and a better job.\n\nI'm really interested to see what you guys have to say about it. I don't know much about this topic.\n\nResponse A Author: km89\n\nResponse A: \nI live in the USA, so I'll focus my argument there.\n\nPeople who have minimum wage jobs aren't there because they're lazy. \nEducation is expensive. Obtaining skill and obtaining education, therefore, requires either help from someone who does have the money, or a way to earn the money by yourself. Normally, the parents of college-age people are expected to pay or to help, but with the crap economy, that can't happen the way it used to happen. \n\nSo you have a whole generation of people who are left to pay for college nearly entirely by themselves, in a time when wages are low and costs are high. Put simply, low-skill jobs pay so little that it's almost impossible to go to school full-time. Therefore, people are taking longer and longer to enter the workforce at a high level, and are spending more and more time in low-wage jobs. In the meantime, they're paying for part-time school, they're paying for housing, for food, for bills, for the costs of owning a car... and frankly, you cannot expect them not to have a social life until they're well-established in a job after four to to seven years of education--they wouldn't have a life until they're 40, which precludes a lot of family-starting. \n\nIn essence, the longer you wait to get an education, the more bills you'll end up accumulating, and that's unavoidable. In addition, the lower your wage, the longer you'll have to wait to get your education. Following that, the lower your wage, the longer you'll need to stay in a low-wage position. \n\nIt's a vicious cycle--low wages lead to lack of opportunity, which leads to low wages. Reducing or eliminating the minimum wage will only make that *worse,* not better.\n\nWhile yeah, there's probably a percentage of people who have the opportunity and are just too lazy, that doesn't describe most people who just *can't* get a better education. Giving them incentives to move upward won't work when they already have all the incentive they need, but no opportunity to do so.\n\nResponse B Author: cell_frize\n\nResponse B: I entirely disagree with the concept that you can do away with the minimum wage without having serious repercussions. \n\nI find that when we have money, we like to separate ourselves from each other. We are all people. This may sound stupid, but hear me out. The first thing I have a problem is that we have a sense of superiority toward those who work at lower-skilled jobs. Just because those people don't have the skills that someone else does, doesn't mean their job is worthless. A grocery bagger or cashier is just as important for society to thrive as a CEO of some company somewhere. I find it incredibly disgusting that people think that lower skill jobs are somehow worth less. These are still people, and they're people who make your life easier. Sure, maybe their job isn't as difficult or as demanding as yours, but they're just as entitled to a fair wage as anyone else is. If you disagree with that, then go build your own roads, grow your own food, and make your own society somewhere.  We as a society need to be able to work together and not have these huge class differences that we like to make. These people who work for these companies make that company operate. Where would McDonalds be without people to cook the burgers? I can't stand the idea that you can give those people, people without whom you wouldn't be able to make a damn cent, just the scraps or the bare minimum that they'll accept before they think it's not worth it. \n\nThe second thing is that how do you expect anyone to be able to move anywhere in life? Sure, society requires plumbers, electricians, and all--but how can you justify the idea that \"oh, they can just go get this barely livable job, oh well.\"? Life isn't just about survival, it's about living. If you don't want people to be able to live no matter what their job, go out and do their jobs for you yourself. \n\nThe minimum wage, in my opinion, is absolutely necessary. Companies go out of their way to cut wages and make sure that they're spending the least amount of money. It's about them trying to do whatever necessary to get as much money as possible, and they end up walking all over society to do so.  In my personal opinion, it may be a better option to force companies to actually care about their employees instead of just mandating a strict minimum. I feel like the rich are so clueless about what it's like to live at the bottom, that they don't realize that some people don't just have crap jobs, they're actually struggling to survive.  \n\nFurthermore, I don't understand the argument that \"oh, it's a bad thing to live on minimum wage.\" If you can live on minimum wage, and you are living, and providing your job service to society--why is that bad? Sure, we may not require thousands of engineers, but we definitely require people who can do things all over the spectrum. Whenever you step over those people, all you're doing is making life harder for everyone else.

However, being gay has far more acceptance than being an atheist.  Neither is a choice, as a person can't force themselves to believe in a god any easier than they can force themselves to think the Earth is the center of the universe.  \n\nI don't believe either is an easy thing to be open about in certain areas of the country, but coming out as gay is a lot more accepted than coming out as an atheist.  I think it ultimately comes down to the fact that homosexuality doesn't inherently make the claim that a person's religion is false.  \n\nResponse A Author: Bagodonuts10\n\nResponse A: It obviously depends on the circumstances.  My friend came out as gay and his mom was devastated since she realized that she couldn't have grandkids and I guess she was more homophobic than she led on.  This was a pretty bad experience for him.  He is also not religious (maybe atheist) but neither is his mom so she doesn't care.  \n\nIt could also be said that atheism is not an unchangeable, essential part of who you are so someone hating you for it may not feel as personal of an attack.  It is like the difference between someone hating you for liking a certain kind of music and someone hating you for being black.  One has the potential to hinder your sense of self more, although I know that isn't universal and many atheists have a lot of issues with this as well.  I know that atheism isn't a choice but at least for me, it doesn't feel as connected to my identity as my sexual orientation.  If I was gay I'd flat out feel more uncomfortable telling people than I feel telling them I am an atheist.\n\nI am not discounting the struggles of atheists in less progressive parts of the world since I know they are often treated terribly, but I'm not willing to say that it is harder just because homosexuality is more accepted than atheism in our society.  For some people it is absolutely harder, especially if they have parents who are ok with homosexuality, but hate atheists.  I am just not sure that the prevalence of this is enough to discount the sense of identity that I mentioned earlier.  \nI'll also add that if you change the name atheist to agnostic, sooo many more people would be cool with it since much of the hate for atheism is simply based on the fact that people don't know what it is.  My mom was upset when I told her I was an atheist until I explained to her what it actually meant.  Long story short, she was an atheist too, she just didn't know that that's what she was.              \n\nResponse B Author: DerekReinbold\n\nResponse B: I think the two are probably comparable in a number of respects, like the ones that you pointed out. I think coming out as gay is somewhat harder than you described because it brings up the same religious qualms, and you're basically telling your parents that they'll never have biological grandchildren.\n\nRegardless of this, I don't really like comparing things like this. They're both hard, incredibly hard. They're both very current issues (I think the whole atheism one will begin to come up more and more and somewhat agree that atheism is more stigmatized than homosexuality). But it's like comparing the holocaust to Stalin's mass killings or Pol Pot.

This is no longer something that people discuss and the government doesn't comment on; the administration has now admitted to the killing of four **US citizens** in drone strikes, three of whom were not targets.\n\nSources: \n\nhttp://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/05/2013522204811334806.html\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/22/american-citizens-drone-strikes_n_3321950.html\n\n\nMy main argument stems from a reading of the Constitution. The Constitution represents a contract between the Government and The People. I find the following excerpts to be particularly important in this case (listed in order of applicability, with emphasis added):\n\n~~Amendment XIV, Section 1, Paragraph 1:\n\n\nAmendment V:\n\n\nAmendment VI:\n\n\nArticle III, Section 2, Paragraph 3:\n\n\nArticle II, Section IV:\n\n\n(Online source for quotations: http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html)\n\n\nIn my understanding of the Constitution, ~~all four~~ three of the fatalities were unlawful. ~~The killing of Anwar Al-Awlacki should be classified Murder in the First Degree, as it was clearly premeditated and he was not tried, so the killing cannot be deemed capital punishment.~~ The killing of Al-Awlacki can be justified by saying he was an enemy combatant, the capture of whom would have been infeasible. However, if the three were accidental as claimed, they are still felony manslaughter. Such felony level offenses are gross abuses of power, and must fit the definition of a \"high crime\". This, in my understanding, makes it obvious that impeachment is an appropriate course of action, and, if the Senate finds the defendants guilty, they should then be tried in civilian court, since the offenses are against other citizens of the United States.\n\nChange my view.\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Jazz-Cigarettes\n\nResponse A: I think that in general, the drone strikes are problematic in a veritable cornucopia of different ways, but here's my take on al-Awlaki. \n\nHe was both a U.S. citizen a senior member of al-Qaeda, and so it's fairly difficult to argue that he wasn't committing treason, right? So in a perfect world, he'd deserve a trial for that treason, the result of which almost certainly would've been conviction and execution.\n\nBut he'd been out of the country and on the run for years, AND he was still actively participating in and abetting the operations of al-Qaeda right up until his death. So what if a trial for al-Awlaki was never realistically going to be a possibility? What if there was never going to be a feasible opportunity to capture him or conduct a raid on him a la bin Laden?\n\nIt's not like he was a random high-value terrorist who regularly made visits to the U.S. where he could be easily captured. If he was revealed to be checking out a falafel restaurant in Nashville, Tennessee, and the Obama administration chose to drone strike him into oblivion when they could have easily apprehended him instead, that would be a regrettable decision.\n\nI think al-Awlaki raises an interesting question: what do you do about an American citizen who is actively committing treason against the country, but is doing so while on the run and who may be difficult or impossible to capture? Do you allow him to continue coordinating terrorist attacks against you because you can't capture and try him, even though you *could* kill him?\n\nResponse B Author: Jackle13\n\nResponse B: Other users have shown how his actions are probably legal, but from a moral standpoint, why is the fact that some of them were American even relevant? Is killing an American worse than killing a foreigner? With regard to Al-Awlacki, if you are involved in a terrorist group, why should the fact that you were born in the US protect you? I understand why people have a problem with drone strikes in general, but I do not understand why the fact that one of the targets was American matters for any reasons other than legal ones.

I believe that admiration of another person's physique is not hurtful but rather complimentary, and I believe that people who lash out against those who do need a reality check.

This group consisted of both men and women, of all physiques, ages, etc.\n\nAs you can plainly see, the title and content of the article mentions that women were \"surprised and upset\" as men showed up to admire their bodies, some even snapping photographs. This type of attitude toward open displays of sexual attraction is not an isolated incident, as I'm sure you're all aware.\n\nI honestly do not understand the concept behind this. To explain my stance perhaps a bit better, here are some bullet points:\n\n* These men and women **chose** to remove their clothing.\n\n* These men and women **chose** to be in public.\n\n* These men and women are well aware that sexuality exists and has a strong relationship with exposed skin.\n\n* No one was raped or molested.\n\n* Looking is not rape or molestation.\n\nWith these facts in mind, I cannot fathom how these people could be \"surprised\" that people showed up to have a look, nor can I empathize with people who say they are outraged or emotionally offended. It seems to me like they are trying to play thought police, bandying about something that in Western culture is very blatantly sexual and then demanding that people not think about them in a sexual way. Either that, or there is an extreme amount of naivet\u00e9 at work here.\n\nThis isn't isolated to just nudity or partial nudity, either. It has become a trope in Western society that when attractive people, perhaps most often women, wear provocative clothing out in public, they get \"harassed\" by people giving them compliments or simply looking a bit too long. These people get **angry** at being looked at or complimented on their appearance. Our world is sexual. It is the way nature works.

I would be happy to provide more examples as needed.\n\nWhen men take pictures, ogle, and cat call, they are not \"complimenting\" these women.

Every such act is abhorrent and needs to be prevented if possible, and remedied if not.\n\nI have found myself unable to have meaningful conversations with many of my Jewish/Israeli or Armenian friends if we touch on either the Holocaust or the Armenian genocide. I don't think the emotional hypersensitivity they express is in any way justified considering how long ago these atrocities occurred and that they have not and will not affect them personally in any way.\n\nMy issue here really is temporally focused, which is why I'm not talking about the Rwandan genocide. Most adult Rwandans today lived through the genocide and have lost loved ones that they had met and spent time with.\n\nI've taken to referring to a victimhood complex, where basically a significant portion of one's cultural or ethnic identity is based on being a victim, and I think it's petty and tremendously counter-productive. For example, I tried having a conversation with a Jewish friend about the \"draw the holocaust\" contest that was setup by some IranCartoon and my argument was basically that you can't defend the rights of publications like Charlie Hebdo to poke fun at Islam without also having to defend IranCartoon's rights to mock the Holocaust. This quickly turned into a lecture on how my friend's family was exterminated by the Nazis. My friend would not likely have ever met the extended family members who perished under the Nazi regime, and she is not in any way under threat here in the US.\n\nSimilarly, conversations about US-Turkey relations, or Turkey's potential role in the Middle East today devolve quickly into a \"recognize the Armenian genocide!\" rant, which I think is a little more justifiable because it involves validating one's own history, but still the issue remains that such a backwards focus is, in my mind, petty and counter-productive.\n\nI don't think people born in the 80s, 90s or 00s, people who have not lost people whom they have met and valued, people who have hardly any personal connection to such events, are at all entitled to being overly sensitive, emotional, or upset when their narratives are questioned/challenged or when their histories are attacked or trivialized.\n\nI think that gives a good explanation of where I'm at, but I'll do my best to clarify if needed in future edits.

Can you really say that your family history consisting of \"my parents (or grand parents)  came here and everyone they new and loved from before than suffered in the hands of the nazis\" doesn't effect you?\n\nResponse B Author: demipearl\n\nResponse B: Large, terrible events in the history of certain groups of people leave scars. There are people who still have Holocaust survivors in their families - there are people whose parents lost their entire family. Knowing that your family was exterminated because people hated them that much for being Jewish is a pretty terrible thought to grow up with as a Jew, and trauma and stress about something actually can be passed from generation to generation. Not to mention, neo-nazis and the like still exist - Jewish people all over the world are still discriminated against to large degrees, and since our worst case scenario already happened, we feel like we have to be cautious at all times and remind people that what happened was serious and had long-lasting impact that still isn't healed (there are still a lot less Jews than there were before the Holocaust, for example). In many Jewish people's eyes, even young Jews, the world has already proven to us that it wants us dead. Why wouldn't we be sensitive about one of the worst things to happen to our people while anti-semitism continues to be on the rise all over the world? I have been told personally to get in the shower, that I should be put in a concentration camp, etc just for existing as a Jewish person (who isn't even religious), so people out there are still literally wishing that the Holocaust happened to me. I think many Jews see this similarly and that's why I think we are so sensitive to it. Because technically, is does still have an effect on us, whether it's through loss or anti-semitic harassment and attacks.\n\nLinks on antisemitism being perpetuated today: [here](http://tabletmag.com/scroll/189243/study-anti-semitism-on-the-rise-at-u-s-colleges), [here](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/antisemitic-attacks-uk-community-security-trust-britain-jewish-population), and [here](http://www.religionnews.com/2014/05/13/survey-one-four-globally-infected-anti-semitism/). Note how in the last link, it says that 46 percent of the people polled have either not heard of the Holocaust or think it is a myth and/or exaggerated. I would say that's a major reason to want to continue talking about it and being sensitive about it.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author phcullen's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Gay people should be allowed to marry if they so choose.  \nBut that doesn't mean that every church or belief has to agree to perform marriages between homosexual people. If a specific belief says they're against gay marriage and don't want to perform it, that's fine. The gay people can just go next door to the church of a different faith, or to a courthouse.  \nThe religion shouldn't have to change it's view because something is made legal.

However, a couple of points:\n\n\nVoters have the right to cast their votes after private deliberation, which inevitably will sometimes include religious influences.\n\n\nThere's a difference between views and actions.  A church is free to hold the *view* that having a pet cat is a sure sign of witchcraft, and ought to be met with capital punishment.  They're not free to act on that view.  \n\nIf a religious group chooses to operate a business that offers some sort of goods or services to the general public -- a \"public accommodation\", as it's called -- then it gives up some of the privilege to discriminate that it has in its strictly religious activities.  So in the case of the for-profit wedding chapel, the people running the place can't be required to act in their capacity as ministers of their church by holding a religious ceremony for a same-sex couple.  But if they offer, for a fee, to help with the legal paperwork for non-believing couples that walk in off the street with no connection to their church, then they can be required not to discriminate in that offer.\n\nResponse B Author: NaturalSelectorX\n\nResponse B: \nThe problem occurs when religious belief exists outside the church. Should a Christian that vehemently opposes gay marriage have to provide the services of their business for gay weddings? \n\nOne of the reason churches are getting in trouble is because they rent out facilities as if they were a business, and operating a business means you can't discriminate.

I think you should marry whomever you want, it's none of my business.\n\nI just saw this article posted in another subreddit, and it served as a good example of what bothers me:\n\nhttp://www.filmsforaction.org/news/bosom_buddies_a_photo_history_of_male_affection/\n\nSocial backlash against homosexuals has gone DOWN the last hundred years. This is self evident by the fact that we are legalizing gay relationships all over the world. The fact that there is a MAJORITY of people (in many areas) who support gay relationships makes this fact non-debatable. In 1900 virtually NO ONE would even consider such a thing. What HAS changed is the assumption that you must be gay if you behave a certain way. The men in those pictures are comfortable posing in intimate ways because it would have never crossed their minds that people would assume them to be a gay couple.\n\nIf I posted a picture like that, many people would assume that I was gay. I'm not saying they would \"backlash\" against it, even if they were 100% supportive, they would still be likely to assume. This is because it has become much more common to be publicly gay. This assumption really bothers me. I don't like that I can't behave how I want to, without people making assumptions, based on stereotypes.\n\n\"You're a sensitive man? You must be gay\"\n\n\"You have a high tenor? Must be gay\"\n\n\"Good communicator? Gay\"\n\n\"Like broadway? Gay\"\n\nThis is no different from \"You're black? You must be great at basketball!\" (although it works in reverse in this example) It doesn't make it any better if it's a POSITIVE stereotype. I don't care how HAPPY you are that you think I'm gay, I'm not, and it pisses me off that the assumption is made based on incredibly broad, stupid criteria.\n\nIt's none of my Goddamn BUSINESS what someone else does, or who they love, this I firmly believe. But I'm getting really sick of shows like Glee deciding that the ONLY kids that suffer in High School are the gay ones, and that the ONLY unique, or talented people are the gay ones. It just reinforces the stereotypes. Which harms EVERYONE, gay or straight.\n\nThe end conclusion that I find obvious, is that male intimacy has declined because of HOW we are ACCEPTING gay relationships. Don't get me wrong! I'm not advocating that we DON'T accept them! But we are doing it wrong. Instead of accepting people for who they are; each, as individuals, we are OBSESSING over labeling everyone. I find it depressingly hilarious that in an effort to accept people who are different, we are forcing people into neat tidy little categories that make us feel good about how \"accepting\" we are.\n\nYou know what? There are teenagers out there who are going through hell in puberty. It's confusing, your hormones rage over EVERYTHING. It's very difficult to understand yourself, and it's a hell of a lot HARDER when all of society is standing over your shoulder, wanting you to fit in it's neat, tidy cubbyholes!\n\nI have a male friend, we consider ourselves to be brothers, like many of the men in those pictures. He's a part of my family, a second big brother to my sisters, and a man I would trust with my life, every time. Whenever we hang out together, or get food, or anything, we are very OBVIOUSLY assumed to be a gay couple, usually by people who are embarrassingly proud of themselves for how \"accepting\" they are. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't \"bother\" me particularly, on a personal level, because I'm confident in my sexuality, and I'm not \"afraid\" of looking gay. But it emphasizes my point. 100 years ago, everyone would think we are what we are; brothers by choice, if not by blood.\n\nThe environment we are creating doesn't HELP gay or transgender people, it makes things more difficult for ALL of us. All the while the political right are so pathetically scared of gays, they make asses out of themselves on a daily basis, and the political LEFT are so busy patting themselves on the back for how \"progressive\" they are, they're gonna sprain their elbows!\n\nThese social issues are COMPLICATED, and you don't paint a Rembrandt using a wall-roller! We latch onto these broad, easy \"solutions\" that make us feel good, but don't solve anything.\n\nI'm sorry for the rant, but it's a fucking mess, and I'm so goddamn sick of all of it. I want to hear other perspectives on these things, and I want my viewpoint challenged, or at least expanded.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: taresp\n\nResponse A: We are always trying to decode social interactions, what about a brother and a sister going out to dinner, some people would automatically think they're a couple which they're not. It's just people trying to make sense of a situation and a given context.\n\n\n100 years ago the idea that you were a gay couple just wouldn't have been an option. It is nowadays *because* society has been accepting gays. Basically, it just adds a new way to understand a given situation. \n\nAnd I think most of the awkwardness comes from the novelty, you're basically telling people that there was a different way to understand some human interactions and they never got it before. And so they're trying very hard to understand this new interaction, trying to build patterns with stereotypes, or maybe trying to apply this new interaction everywhere (like you and your friend).\n\nOverall, even though I don't like it at all, this reaction from society seems pretty logical, I'd say give it time, the novelty will fade eventually and it will get better.\n\nResponse B Author: EyeRedditDaily\n\nResponse B: \nIt seems that your entire view hinges on this statement.  Why does it matter if people assume you're gay?  If you have a problem with people thinking you might be gay, then that's a problem with you.  That isn't a problem with them, gays, transgenders, society or the \"way we are promoting acceptance\".\n\nWhat if it wasn't an assumption that you were gay?  What if you have blond hair but due to the lighting in a specific picture, it looks more brown.  Would it \"really bother you\" if someone made the assumption that you had brown hair based upon that photo?  Unless you're some kind of hair-Nazi, I'd imagine you wouldn't really give a fuck and the person's incorrect assumption about your hair color would be a complete non-event.

CMV.\n\nOp: Since I'm not brave enough to post my actual views on the abortion debate, I thought I would start with this.\n\nAs everyone knows, abortion is a massive issue in American politics, and the two opposing factions are both immensely powerful and extremely influential. The arguments for and against abortion cross into economics, feminism, history, religion, health, medicine, law, and social justice. The Pro-Lifers have a long list of reasons why abortion is bad/stupid/harmful/dangerous/corrupt etc etc. The Pro-Choicers have a similarly long list on how abortion is fantastic/liberating/healthy/smart/important etc etc.\n\nBut all of that is a smokescreen to try and cover up the fact that we have no way of proving that a fetus is or is not a person. And that's really the only thing that matters.\n\nIf a fetus is not a person, then the pro-life objections lose most of their impact. Sure, the industry may have lax health standards and poor regulation, but the solution to that is stricter health inspections, not making it illegal. Yeah, abortion clinics can be real shady when it comes to minors, but that is only one small part of it. Even if you think abortion is distasteful, disgusting, or desperate, nobody is actually getting hurt.\n\nIf, however, the fetus is a person, then all of the pro-choice arguments become pathetic, and weaponized against them. After all, if a women has the right to bodily autonomy, then that includes the female babies, and their right to not get killed. If people should have the right to live their lives how they want it, then surely that includes a fetuses right to live? Pregnancies can pose a health risk to the mother, but abortions pose a hell of a bigger risk to the child, and so on.\n\nI think that the \"personhood\" question is the only thing that matters in the abortion debate, and anything else is just a waste of time. Change my view.\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: I think there are a lot more valid questions to ask.\n\nLike...how can we prevent abortions from being a problem, that would be a good one to ask.  Like for example, asking if there is a way to prevent unintended conceptions.   Or even better, can we develop a mechanism so transferring an embryo is the same risk medically as an abortion?  \n\n\nResponse B Author: tacos_4_all\n\nResponse B: \nLet's say just for the sake of this argument that it is a person. Let's say that a fetus is a person.\n\nThere is still another important question we would need to ask before we can decide whether abortion should be permitted, or whether it is morally acceptable.\n\nImagine there were a little person living inside you, but you did not invite him there. If it is a full person, as you suggest and I admit for the purpose of this discussion, then this little person has a right to live. But that does not necessarily imply that you as the other affected party is under any obligation to host the uninvited little person inside your body at great risk to yourself.\n\nSo after we ask and determine an answer to the question of fetal personhood, we still must ask:\n\nIs the person carrying the fetus under an obligation to carry the fetus until birth.\n\nIt's a separate question. \n\nPersonally I don't know the answer. \n\nBut I believe this does address your initial position that there is only one valid question to ask.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author [deleted]'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

This goes back to ancient times, but is clearly true in the present day; Israelis are gathering in public places by the hundreds, if not thousands, dancing and singing things like \"There are no children left in Gaza, Oleh!\"\n\nThe Palestinians are the modern-day descendants of the Philistines. The Israelis are simply perpetuating an agenda of ethnic cleansing that is thousands of years old. This is how the Israelis act, displaying overwhelming support (suggestions place public support for the ground campaign in Gaza as high as 87%; since when does 87% of any public support anything its government does?) for genocidal endeavors.\n\nThis lasts until they come up against somebody too strong for them to defeat alone, at which point it's \"poor Israelis\" and \"persecuted Jews.\" World War II? The Holocaust was horrible. I'd agree. Thank God we'll never forget all the Gypsies, the homosexuals, the mentally disabled, and other groups that the Nazis persecuted. \n\nY'know how they made the homosexuals wear pink triangles, so they'd stand out from their neighbors and could be singled out for relocation and persecution?\n\nWait, you didn't know that? Well, there's no surprise. God forbid that the Holocaust be about anyone else but the Jewish people. I don't know how the history books read in other countries; in America, nobody mentions anyone but the Jews. There are no photographs of anyone else being persecuted. Pink triangles pinned to homosexuals? Shit, even a college education over here isn't guaranteed to go into that, but I knew what a \"Star of David\" was when I was four years old, and why it is so awful that Hitler did what he did to those poor Jewish people (and it is awful, beyond awful; don't get me wrong). \n\nWhat about Jewish rituals?\n\nKosher food is considered pure. Y'know why? It's because the animals are killed by being first immobilized, then having their necks cut approximately halfway through with a slow sawing motion. The animal is left to bleed out in pain, as Jewish tradition holds that the slow bleeding out and suffering of the animal renders the meat somehow \"pure.\" \n\nLiterally, \"the suffering adds flavor\" (and, probably, another thing that was necessary thousands of years ago for health reasons, that is no longer necessary, but is one of those mindless traditions that is indulged in for the sake of being \"time-honored;\" in the case of Jewish tradition, however, this seems to pass from 'quaint' to 'sickeningly horrifying' without much exception). \n\nJewish culture is stuck in the mindset of a world that is thousands of years gone, when it was literally \"kill or be killed\" for every little tribe on the planet, and a few hundred people dead could mean the end of your ethnic group. The Jews lost 6,000,000 in WWII and are currently a stronger force than they have ever before been in human history, within living memory of the Holocaust... but they don't seem to have gotten that message. Small wonder, perhaps, given that they're likely fairly indignant at how the lesser races of treated them.\n\nJews all but invented the concept of the \"master race.\" They have a word for people who aren't Jewish--*gentile*. Now, this isn't so distinct from other religious groups in some fashion; southern Baptists routinely refer to other people as \"nonbelievers\" and Muslims have the famous \"infidel,\" but terms like these tend to have something in common: they denote *other people* as being *ideologically wrong* in the viewpoint of the individuals using said terminology. This is not the case with \"gentile,\" the Jews don't *want* to convert you. You aren't *pure*. Gentile denotes people who are, in Jewish tradition, physically inferior--as is also evidenced by their use of \"Jewish\" to describe themselves as a religious faith, as a political state, and as an *ethnicity*. Even the most hardcore Christians don't identify themselves as being \"ethnically\" Christian; in fact, they'd vehemently deny it, stating that a person must be individually \"saved\" to be Christian. \n\nNot so the Jews. They're superior, everybody else is inferior, and they don't even particularly *like* it when someone wants to convert. And if nobody's actually giving them a hard time? They'll make it up; ample evidence suggests that the Jews were never enslaved by the Egyptians; it's generally accepted that the Bible story of the enslavement is a complete fabrication. The Pyramids were built by Egyptian farmers and craftspeople who were paid for their labors and well taken care of, and there is no sign of the economic collapse that would have occurred had a million slaves walked out of Egypt overnight.\n\nIt is possible to honor your ancestors and revere those who fell in times of horrifying carnage and catastrophe without using it to justify an ongoing tradition of genocide, barbarism, and delusions of physiological superiority. Yet, not only are the Israelis not doing this, but we (America) are aiding and abetting them in their ongoing vileness. These people are targeting individual wheelchair-bound people with helicopter rockets, and beaches of small children with warships, and we're paying to refill their ammunition stockpiles. It leaves me feeling positively sick.\n\nThey are literally one moral step away from walking into peoples' living rooms and skinning their children alive, or from sacrificing people to God, but you can't say anything bad about the Jews.

For one, we know there were Semitic/Asiatic slaves. Two, the idea of a transition from a Hyksos (Semitic/Asiatic, possibly even largely from Cana'an) dynasty to a non Hyksos dynasty might be similar to the transition from the pharaoh who \"knew Joseph\" to those who didn't, as mentioned at the beginning of Exodus. But **three, and I find this most convincing, people don't make up that they were slaves**. If you look through myths of ethnogensis, you very rarely see \"our lives were made difficult under the heavy yoke of slavery\".

Jews have a different covenant with God than other peoples, but different is not necessarily superior**. I mean, we think highly of it, for us, but it is not required for anybody else.   \n\n\nBecause of our acceptance of Torah, Jews have a special status in the eyes of God, but we lose that special status when we abandon Torah.  Furthermore, the blessings that we received from God by accepting the Torah come with a high price:  **Jews have a greater responsibility than non-Jews.  While non-Jews are only obligated to obey the seven commandments given to Noah, Jews are responsible for fulfilling the 613 mitzvot in the Torah, thus God will punish Jews for doing many things that would not be a sin for non-Jews**.  \n\n\n**That said, a gentile who wants to join the Jewish people -- which is not necessary, but which some feel called to do -- is allowed to convert**.

Aside from the Canaanites and modern-day Israel's advances on Gaza (which I disagree with vehemently, but cannot legitimately call genocide), I don't see how any of these things happen with such historical prevalence that you feel justified in an absurd and erroneous oversimplification of history.  More realistically, Jewish history is that of getting the shit kicked out of you.  The Romans kinda did (but not really), Europe did to varying degrees for a few centuries; often trying to forcibly convert or expel them before they ultimately tried to exterminate them.  Russian shtetls were poor as shit...I'm having trouble finding the genociding.\n\n\nAs I said, referring to what's happening in Gaza as ethnic cleansing is dubious.  Saying it's because Palestinian=Philistine is absurd.  There are much more reasonable and proximate causes and explanations; namely the conflict and controversy surrounding the creation of the modern state of Israel and the results of defensive wars fought when that country was attacked.\n\nYou also shouldn't conflate Israel with all Jews or \"Jewish culture\".  That's like me pointing to Taliban-era Afghanistan is representative of Muslims or North Korea as representative of Koreans.  It's a categorization error.\n\nThat, and there's natural gas under Gaza.\n\n\nI don't know what history books your school district brought, but I learned all that before high school.  Having said that, there are a few reasons why you're probably getting this impression.\n\nFirst, the purpose of a high school or 100-level history class is to teach you the relevant narrative to give you a basic understanding of history.  This means that important details are going to be deemphasized or dropped for the sake of expediency.  This literally has to be done if we don't plan on forcing everyone to spend most of their time studying history.\n\nSecond, Jews were the largest group and the most explicitly targeted by the Nazi regime.  Read some of Hitler's writings...hell, read what he wrote right before he died:\n\n\nThat's the last sentence Hitler wrote before he killed himself.  The Nazis didn't like anything they thought might corrupt their blood, so they obviously wanted to get rid of everyone who wasn't appropriately German and anybody who had anything they thought of as a weakness or infirmity (that second part wasn't so unique to the Nazis).  But they had an irrational and unfounded *hatred* of Jews rooted in paranoid delusions of an international conspiracy that made them lose WWI.  That paranoia began with the same generalizations and assumptions about \"international Jewry\" that you seem to subscribe to.\n\n\nAgain, you're conflating Israel with all Jews and ignoring proximate causes for current conflicts.  I don't agree at all with what Israel is doing now, but they have had Arab coalitions try to destroy them twice in the half century since their country came into existence.  I can understand how that would make a group of people a bit antsy.\n\nAnd seriously, the Jews are \"stronger force than they have ever been before in human history\"?  You're taking a page out of Mein Kampf and you aren't correcting any errors.  You're assuming an \"international Jewry\" that is unified in purpose and acting in concert; you're assuming that an international conspiracy exists as a premise of your argument.\n\n\nSavage. Barbarian. Gaijin. Kafir. Ausl\u00e4nder. Commie. Laowai.  Words denoting a hostile other are common across the human species.  Singling out Jews for having one that denotes little more than \"not a Jew\" is absurd.  And saying that this equates to declaring a master race?  Spare the rhetorical whip; the horse is dead and the arguments don't make sense.\n\n\nCitation for that?  Any evidence at all?\n\n\nAgain, what are you talking about?  Where are you pulling these ideas about connotations of physiological superiority?  You're basing it off of either flawed perception or an exceptionally bad source.  You appear not to know much of Jewish history in Europe, which is the only reason I can think of that you can talk about an \"ongoing tradition of genocide\" seriously.\n\nAnd again, I don't agree with Israel in this case.  But they're fighting because they don't want to die, not because they're \"honoring their ancestors\".\n\n\nWhat?  First of all, I think the \"skinning children alive\" thing is a bit of hyperbole and I don't like to be Mr. PC, but kind of echoes the blood libel.\n\nAnd once again, Jew=!Israeli.\n\n\nI really don't.  When someone confesses to disliking a group of people who share no common characteristics that could legitimately harm them, I don't really give them a chance.  I might listen to them, but I'm going to think they're wrong and not a particularly good person.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author karelos's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

A religious person assumes that their religious fantasy affects reality in someway (for example the devil creates sin) and their whole word view is affected by their faith. \n\n\"...cannot conduct her/his affairs due to psychosis...\" A person of faith also changes his/her behavior because of their faith. For example, A person might believe that \"god has a plan\" for them, and as a result take different actions that he wouldn't have if he wasn't religious. Maybe some of the things he does as a result of his faith can be considered as good, but that's not the point. A person with faith tends to involve their religious beliefs in their morals and thinking and therefore behaves differently.\n\n\nResponse A Author: cwenham\n\nResponse A: Religious faith and identity behaves more like tribal loyalty than insanity. Before the concept of religion was even born, creation myths and deity figures were simply part of culture, like Batman and Spiderman are to us. You took the myths for granted, but they also became a way of distinguishing your people from other people, like a shibboleth. \n\nReligion didn't become separate from culture until a few thousand years ago (probably as a result of the Romans). Humans naturally crave membership in communities or tribes, and those communities automatically begin generating their own culture and mythologies. Religion was essentially a kind of metastasized culture.\n\nThe reason why people believe their mythologies against better judgement or logic is because it has nothing to do with logic or judgement. It's all about tribal affiliation and loyalty.\n\nMost of the time, in its healthiest form, it doesn't hold much more than a symbolic position. Big Bird is the Father, Elmo is the Son, and Mr. Snuffalupagus is the Holy Spirit. Doesn't matter how ridiculous it is. In fact, the crazier it sounds, the better. If you can believe some guy dug up some gold plates in upstate New York and translated them by staring at some rocks in the bottom of a hat, then you pass the test and your loyalty is unquestioned. Outside of the church, you ignore almost all of it. Nobody really believes it, they just go through the motions. This is what it was like for hundreds of years in many parts of the world.\n\nZealotry and fundamentalism come about where tribes meet. The behavior you see is remarkably similar to the behavior of sports fans for opposing teams meeting each other. It's not a mental illness, because if it is then we need to classify 99% of humanity as insane, it's just a natural expression of tribe-vs-tribe.\n\nResponse B Author: Daedalus1907\n\nResponse B: You're being extremely lax with the definition of insanity.\n\nBelief in a higher power is not fantasy, it's entirely supernatural and something which cannot be proven to exist or not exist. Let alone, religious people are capable of distinguishing their faith from the natural world. Most religious people do not claim to see angels, hear voices, etc. \n\nYou seriously believe that religious people cannot conduct their affairs? Something like 90% of the country believes in god but they are wholly incapable of conducting their affairs? So what if they might do something differently because of their faith. Every belief changes behavior to some extent, that difference does not mean they are non-functioning.

Change my view.\n\nOp: Every time I see a commercial for the Dove \u201cReal Beauty\u201d campaign I get rather annoyed an offended. These commercials portray women who are supposed to represent what \u201creal beauty\u201d is. The eight or nine women featured are of average height and vary in skin tones, but are all \u201ccurvy\u201d. None of them are what people would consider skinny or thin. I don\u2019t think anyone would label them as athletic or incredibly fit, nor would anyone say they are obese. \n\nMy issue here is that many people have tried to convince the world that no matter what size you are, you\u2019re beautiful and should love your body. That being said, this commercial shows one type of body, rather curvy and maybe even verging on slightly overweight. \n\nIs real beauty not being thin, even though you may happen to have a high metabolism or eat healthy foods?

Are we saying that it\u2019s okay to have extra fat on your bodies because \u201cno matter what size you are, you\u2019re beautiful\u201d? \nI realize that many people can\u2019t help what size they are no matter what they do, and I\u2019m not saying that being stick thin or anorexic is okay either, and I don\u2019t agree with modeling agencies that promote models being underweight. What I don\u2019t support is companies saying that real beauty is being round and curvy when in actuality, that may not be very healthy and shouldn't be settled for. \n\nI think women should try and be their best self, fit, healthy, active, and strong. I think these women should be praised and promoted. Although everyone should be confident in their own skin and should never dislike who they are, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to except being overweight because \u201creal women have curves\u201d. \n\nFYI: I am a female, 5\u20198\u201d and weigh around 130 lbs. I run cross country in college so I\u2019m fairly active. \n\n\nResponse A Author: AnnaLemma\n\nResponse A: These campaigns are supposed to stand as a rebuttal of the traditional advertising aesthetic: rail-thin (most non-plus-size models are size 0 or 00, and are medically underweight), and airbrushed/Photoshopped to a point which is literally unachievable - just look at some of the *models own* before-and-after photos. So it's not about \"fat is sexy,\" but rather about \"you don't have to look like Barbie to be beautiful.\"\n\nAlso, there's a **big** difference about thinking \"my overweight body is perfect\" and \"I am a worthwhile human being despite not looking like a model.\" Yes, some fat-acceptance movements go *way* off the deep end, but this specific campaign is pretty damned benign. It's not saying \"it's okay to be obese\" - it's saying \"it's okay to love yourself even if you're not perfectly fit.\" Physical perfection, and the quest for it, aren't the only worthwhile things in life.\n\nYou have no right to dictate other people's priorities. You think women should \"try and be their best self, fit, healthy, active, and strong\"? Okay, and I think it's more important for women (and men!) to pursue \"the life of the mind\": a full, rich, expansive, fascinating *intellectual* life - a life rich in new experiences, in deep and meaningful relationships, in education and expansion of their worldview. \n\nDoes everyone have time for all of that? Nope. Your priorities are valid - *for you*. My priorities are valid - *for me*. Neither one of us gets to make that call for anyone else.\n\nFinally: about a month ago the major news outlets picked up a story about how fat-shaming doesn't work - [here's the Washington Post article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/09/11/fat-shaming-doesnt-work-a-new-study-says/), but if you Google \"fat shaming doesn't work\" you'll see links to a bunch more. So if telling people that they're fat and disgusting doesn't work... maybe telling them that they're worthwhile *will*? You object to the campaign telling people to love their bodies - but don't you take better care of the things that you love?? If you think your body is worthless shit, why would you care what you put in it? And conversely, if you love it - won't you be *more* likely to take care of it?\n\nOverweight people are *already* surrounded by endless messages of \"you're disgusting\" and \"you're lazy\" and \"you're worthless\" and \"you're weak\" and \"you're stupid\" and so on, and so forth.

If you're really serious about combating the obesity epidemic (as opposed to basking in righteous superiority), wouldn't you be open to trying something *new*, just on the off-chance that it may actually help? You know the saying: the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results.\n\n[As an aside, and to preclude any sort of ad hominem replies, let me just say that I *was* overweight, but dropped 50 lbs last year and am now in the optimal weight range for my height/age. I try to be active, but going to the gym is not an option for time/money/attention-span reasons. I do feel better - physically and emotionally - and would definitely recommend it....

If your body looks like you could be a Victoria's Secret model, there is plenty of positive reinforcement, through advertising, actors, etc.  The point of the campaign is to point out that, while those \"ideal\" women are beautiful, so, too are *you* (the 40-year old mom watching the ad on TV or seeing it in a magazine, who might have given up buying \"beauty\" products because they won't help them look like a model).\n\nYes- the campaign's purpose is to *gasp* sell more product.\n\nBut it is a good thing too.  It's not intended to either ostracize athletes like you, or to discourage exercise.

Meaning I've seen them happy, and it sure looks genuine. \n\nSo why do they want to kill themselves? Why the want to waste and squander life? Is it a constant struggle that is pushed down to smile? Is it a scheduled feeling (it's 8pm, time to be sad and want to kill myself)? Is it a feeling that rears in an acute intensity when you're not ready for it, making you just want to stop the pain?\n\nPersonally, I feel like it's just people being dramatic. These people I know with it have very fortunate lives, and despite that, continue to feel depressed and occasionally suicidal (or maybe constantly, I'm not telepathic).\n\nI want to respect the disease...

CMV\n\nOp: I'd like to keep this CMV with a narrow focus just on this issue, and to not get into a discussion of other aspects of the gun control discussion.\n\n\"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"\n\nMy view basically comes down to this: I can't see any individual or well organized militia successfully preventing the government from taking away their rights. To me, this divides into two categories, (1) inability for you to prevent the government from taking a non-physical right (tracking you through the internet, attacking you with a drone, charging a tax that is an infringement of your rights, not letting you obtain a marriage license, preventing you from voting) and (2) arming yourself with a gun and fight for some physical space. \n\nFor the first point, there are many, many rights that can be taken away and whether or not you have a gun is irrelevant. Abortion could be outlawed tomorrow. I cannot marry a woman. The government is collecting data about me to a degree that's not known. I have to file income taxes. I will have to pay taxes to one day inherit my parent's money. I cannot build any building I want on my own property. My driver's license can be taken away from me. These are not all examples of rights I feel I deserve or want but they are examples of rights where having a gun cannot help me.\n\nNow, for the second point. I simply can't envision a situation where a group of people with guns is able to overpower a police force, the National Guard, a State Militia, or the US Military. So I don't see any situation where people could prevent the government from being in a space and controlling it for a sustainable time period.\n\nPlease, CMV. I have not been able to think of any counter examples to these arguments.\n\n\nAnd thanks to everyone who responded! \n\nResponse A Author: NavalMilk\n\nResponse A: The argument for guns in the case of preventing the government from infringing on your rights boils down to revolution. The less guns available to your citizens, the harder it is for them to oppose you. This is why in places like China and England, citizens are not allowed to have firearms. The gorvernment can exercise more control, and a greater number of people are needed to successfully overthrow that government. (Edit: England has the added benefit of being a geographically small enough country that firearms can be reduced to a low enough number to have a significan impact in firearm related crime rates, as well.)\n\nFirearms are basically a force multiplier. A person of even less than average strength and endurance, with a small amount of training, can become more deadly than a highly trained warrior armed with a sword (or even bow). The army could make quick work of a resistance even in the tens of thousands, but give the resistance guns and the problem becomes much more difficult.\n\nAlthough revolution is highly unlikely, it is a much more real (potential) threat to politicians in America than in many other countries, because of the sheer volume of firearms available to the populace. This combined with a historically inherent distrust of government in general make for a powerful motivator to politicians to not piss people off too much. I believe this is the ONLY reason the NSA scandal isn't being suppressed more actively. Americans saw bullshit and they want people held accountable. The smart representatives see this and know it's time to stop pushing the envelope, at least for a while.\n\nAs for some local group who decided not to pay taxes... not much of a chance there.\n\nResponse B Author: MorganaLeFaye\n\nResponse B: \"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"\n\nBecause you brought the second amendment into it, I assume that you are basically saying that the second amendment is irrelevant because you can't see the people rising up to fight the federal government with guns. \n\nA free state includes free from both internal and external tyranny. So if a foreign power decided to invade and, in some way, was able to cripple our military (even temporarily), the people would still be able to defend themselves because they would be armed. Would they do well? Maybe, maybe not... but they wouldn't be completely defenseless. \n\nBut if that was not what you intended to communicate and really meant to keep the scope of the argument super narrow as to only look at half of the intended meaning of the second amendment, the truth is that your imagination is limited if you can't envision a situation where a group of people with guns can overpower a police force etc. etc. I am sure many people had the same thought about the revolutions in Libya and Egypt... and yet...\n\nIf enough people with enough guns were angry enough that the government wasn't working for them, we'd have a revolution on our hands. The issue is not that guns wouldn't work, it's that not enough people care.

Scarier is that our current social structure is built on the premise that we should keep it, nothing more. As we can see clearly from the arab sprint, our social order is highly fragile and can crumble easily to the slightest of provocations.\n\nIt's much more comforting to most people to think that there's some big evil order imposed from above (be it god or a shadow government) than to face the fact that the world is random, the world is unjust, and nobody holds control over it, it's all just one big mess. \n\nNobody in the \"higher ups\" decides that a president should be killed or some buildings should be destroyed, lone crazies do it, and in some cases other people fail to stop them.

Powerful people do in fact conspire to gain power and money.  But the difference between \"most\" conspiracy theories and legitimate ones (Watergate, etc.) is standard of evidence.  Most conspiracy theorists come up with their theories in a self-sealing way, such that they cannot be disconfirmed.  Any evidence they find contradicting the idea can be easily dismissed as propaganda by the conspirators or incorporated into their alternate reality narrative.\n\n[This article](http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2013/02/26/what-happens-when-you-study-conspiracy-theories-the-conspiracy-theorists-make-up-conspiracy-theories-about-you/) discusses a group of scientists who had the opportunity to study conspiracy theories forming in real time.  You can see the flaws in reasoning and immunity to falsification conspiracy theories suffer from.\n\nI guess it's possible that through flawed reasoning and inconsistent standards of evidence that most conspiracy theorists have stumbled upon the truth merely by chance, but that seems implausible.  The best way will always be to examine the actual facts with each theory.  What do we find out when we consider all objections?  \n\nThe Moon Landing was not faked.  Vaccines do not cause autism.

Why I think so:  \n\na) The 'general' subreddits with the largest following (eg. /r/todayilearned, /r/videos, /r/pics, /r/funny) are easy places to push an agenda. They have huge audiences and mod teams that don't care about what gets submitted there, so long as it follows their very short list of rules.  \n\nb) Site demographics/popular opinions. From my time on this site, I feel like the majority opinion across most subreddits is conservative on issues such as race or gender, and liberal elsewhere. So when discussing Ferguson you'll see many comments about 'thugs' ruining the movement, or how it's black people's fault for committing so much crime, 'the media won't cover black hate crime' etc. [This one /r/videos thread has that and much more.](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/32yq1n/black_man_who_tortures_kills_two_white_teens/)  \n\nc) Upvote/downvote system. It doesn't take much to control the content on a sub. All it takes is a few upvotes/downvotes within a few minutes and you can guarantee your post gets a lot of attention. If Stormfront uses an IRC to coordinate voting, then they could easily get away with manipulating content. I've seen numerous threads on 4chan's /pol/ directing users to vote on threads in /r/news or /r/videos before.  \n\nd) The recent uptick in 'SJW' hate. All this talk about 'SJWs' and how they're a scourge primes people to ignore many racial issues if it sounds even remotely like something a 'SJW' would say. In the /r/videos thread I linked above, there's numerous references to 'SJWs' being BTFO for trying to say that that one dude's trial shouldn't represent the whole #blacklivesmatter idea.     \n\nCMV: if you're a white supremacist, then reddit.com is the *best site on the Internet to recruit* because of its huge userbase, lax moderation, upvote system, and popular opinion  \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: NSAsurveillanceteam\n\nResponse A: \nWhile this point isn't necessarily false, it doesn't have a large impact. The freedom to push agendas cuts both ways - a white extremist doesn't have any advantage over someone who talks about equality. Obviously, the upvote/downvote system can play a large role in whose comment gets seen, but no group or ideology has an immediate advantage in those subs. Also, the people browsing those subs aren't actively trying to find answers to social issues. Obviously, they can be influenced by what they read, but the average redditor visits those subs for entertainment in the first place. \n\n\nI have to disagree with you on this one. In my experience, reddit is extremely liberal on most issues. For evidence, browse the comment threads of /r/politics for awhile. The amount of conservative hate I see on there amazes me. Mentioning anything against the LGBT community, race, abortion, marijuana legalization, or being in support of religion is a sure fire way of receiving downvotes on most large subs.\n\n\n\nAgain, I agree with on this point. The system can be used to push agendas. But, this also shouldn't have much impact. If a white supremacist can manipulate the votes, an equal rights activist can as well. It cuts both ways. Also, this assumes that most people manipulating the system are white supremacists. I don't see much evidence of this in my experiences. \n\n\nThe reason for the increase of SJW \"hate\" is because most of the SJWs reddit sees aren't actually in support of social justice. The Urban Dictionary (incredible source, I know) defines SJW as \"Social Justice Warrior: A pejorative term for an individual who repeatedly and vehemently engages in arguments on social justice on the Internet, often in a shallow or not well-thought-out way, for the purpose of raising their own personal reputation.\" In my general experience, this is fairly accurate. SJW is a derogatory term for someone who supports a valid idea but argues with poor logic and/or argues in a cheap, annoying, or counterproductive way. The term SJW is a derogatory label not because of the actual ideas/intent of the person, rather the way they talk about and debate said ideas. \n\n\nI have already explained that having a huge user base, lax moderation, upvote system, and popular opinions can cut both ways and therefore have limited impact. As a general rule, most of the arguments you made can apply to most large websites, so to claim that reddit is the \"best site on the internet to recruit\" may be a bit far fetched. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse B Author: ItIsOnlyRain\n\nResponse B: CMV: if you're a white supremacist, then youtube.com is the best site on the Internet to recruit because of its huge userbase, lax moderation, upvote system, and popular opinion.\n\nI am not even going to disagree there are some racists on reddit and sometimes certain unpleasant views are upvoted by certain people but compared to places like youtube it is much tamer and open to discussions occurring. Often the more compelling arguement is the one upvoted more as opposed to youtube which tends towards more one sided arguments.

Since then, we can probably plonk hybrid drive-trains in there, a la the Prius, but electric cars are destined to replace even those, like they were a temporary stopgap. Yet the electric car can't be considered a new thing, either, since they were around over a century ago. All we've done is improve the battery chemistry a bit and progressively improve the efficiency and torque of the motor.\n\nFor computers, we can trace the modern WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointers) interface all the way back to Douglas Engelbart's \"Mother of All Demos\", where he used a wooden mouse to showcase a primitive version of what later turned into the Xerox Star, then the Apple Lisa, the Mac, and Windows.\n\nThe biggest improvement since then has been touch, which came seven years ago with the first iPhone.

There's nothing really like that anymore. HTML sorta kinda wants to evolve in that direction, where you can embed videos in a web page--CORBA/OLE-ishly--but it's not really a combining of functionality, it's really more like a boxing and _containment_ of it.

Apps hoard their features jealously, they don't share them. Mega-Pro Plus Gold^TM has the Twonk feature, but if you need the features exclusive to UltraDingus HD^TM you're stuck.

WIMP is the interface that connects to the computer hardware. To elaborate, in cars, how long has the ~2 pedals, a steerer, and a shifter layout been more or less unchanged? Sure, all the things you mentioned have changed, but, excepting the manual/auto, how many of those directly affected how the car drove. Much like computers, hardware is leaps and bounds ahead of where it was even ten years ago, but we still use the same interface because, hey, it works. Why change something that everyone who uses a computer is familiar with unless there was an overwhelming bonus. I would hazard to say that someone from 60 years ago could drive a modern car and vice versa. The same would hold true for a modern pc and the earliest imac.

For the most part, being a vampire would be awesome.\n\nOp: I doubt this will happen, but just to be safe:  possible **spoilers** for *What We Do In The Shadows* and probably any other vampire flick/book.\n\nMy friend and I watched WWDITS over the weekend, which is a mocumentary about life as a vampire in 2015 (it's awesome and you should see it.)  We ended up having a conversation about the merits of being a vampire.  In a lot of narratives, there's an attempt - almost a strain - to concoct some kind of personal or emotional dilemma the vampire faces (e.g., a reason for them to be unhappy.)  Maybe they miss their family or the sunlight. Similarly, people actively avoid becoming a vampire, even entirely without religious motivation; it's just taken as a given that vampirism is bad.\n\nOn the whole, though, being a vampire sounds awesome.  You get some mix of (or maybe even all of) the following:\n\n- Super speed.\n- Super strength.\n- Hypnosis.\n- Shape-shifting.\n- Immortality.\n- A very small circle of weakness:  garlic, sunlight, religious iconography.\n\nTo be sure, there are some things that would suck.  Not being able to go out during the day would be frustrating but doable and one can get acclimated.  Having to kill people to get blood would be a hurdle,  but in this day in age you could probably find easy, voluntary access to blood (see:  blood banks, weirdos on Craigs list.)  You'd have an adjustment period when everyone you know starts to die, but I *do* think you'd get used to it and it would become a minor encumbrance in contrast to a lengthy list of pros (edit:  for those of you who have read Neil Gaiman's *Sandman,* I think his portrayal of a human being thrust into immortality is probably accurate.)\n\nImmortality in particular seems like the biggest boon.  Lifetimes to invest and make money, try new jobs, specialize in different areas, meet new people, travel, etc.  Your food source is conceivably right at your finger tips and not exactly on their toes when it comes to the vampire predator.\n\nIf revealed, you might become marginalized (as seen in True Blood) but, if I'm being completely honest, I don't know why a super fast, super strong, immortal creature would care at all about what those people think.  More over, since you literally have all the time in the world, you can wait for political change to the extent you do care.\n\nI can see two situations where it might suck:\n\n- You get turned a really young kid or really old adult.\n- You get turned when you have just started a/are mid-family.\n\nBut these strike me as marginal.  I doubt vampires would go around changing children on purpose, and I do think people would get over their first families in the long-term, especially as they cyclically lose people in their lives.  It's possible I'm underestimating the extent to which grief can linger, but I don't think so.\n\nI just don't see the point behind the ennui and morose for vampirism.  In the big picture, why are Bill (True Blood) and Edward (Twilight) so sad and brooding?  If the option existed, I'd almost certainly hope to become a vampire.\n\n\n- A delta for /u/zevlovaci for [drawing comparisons](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3247v7/cmv_fiction_that_portrays_vampires_as_burdened_is/cq7sqqf?context=3) between specific characters' lamentations and modern day parallels (e.g., the way we complain about \"first world problems.\")\n\n- A delta for /u/DHCKris for the [\"What about your soul\" argument](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3247v7/cmv_fiction_that_portrays_vampires_as_burdened_is/cq7t247?context=5), which is actually more potent than I originally realized, not being especially religious myself.\n\n- A delta for /u/depricatedzero, who basically did a [taxonomy of vampire fiction](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3247v7/cmv_fiction_that_portrays_vampires_as_burdened_is/cq83e18?context=3) to illustrate how the cost/benefits of being a vampire can change based upon personality and characterization.\n\n\nResponse A Author: DHCKris\n\nResponse A: The whole idea behind vampirism is that you are an undead monster, incapable of dying or meeting God in heaven; a kind of hell-on-earth.

But presumably, if vampires were real, so would this idea of the immortal soul and heaven and all that.\n\nResponse B Author: Madplato\n\nResponse B: It obviously depends on the depiction of vampires. On of the depictions I liked most represents two of their major flaws well. Theses flaws work whether vampires are superman or not, which I think is interesting. \n\nFirstly, they're dead, so they can't *change*. They're trapped in a permanent stasis where they're constantly put in front of their own flaws without any possibility to ever change them. They're permanently confronted to themselves and this self is slowly deteriorating into a unliving monster. Additionally, they're gonna be like that forever, which is a problem in itself. \n\nSecondly, they're dead, so they can't *feel* stuff. The idea that super strength and what not is awesome only makes sense if you're able to enjoy such power. In truth, you could describe vampires as entirely dominated by the need to feed and the fear to be destroyed. There's nothing actually human about that. You're empty.

This is not true. \n\nThere was one study done over the course of one year that found there was one divorce for every two marriages. There were no follow up studies to confirm it the findings. It fails to take into account that people who divorce once are more likely to do so again in subsequent marriages. Based on this alone, the actual number is estimated to be 30 percent of people go through at least one divorce in their lifetime, but again that hasn't been empirically confirmed. \n\nAnd it also said nothing about the demographics of who is getting married or divorced. The couple getting married in vegas at 21 isn't going to have the same odds as the college graduate couple getting married at 28. There are a lot of factors to consider. \n\nIt's not true that most marraiges end in divorce, and more importantly, most people who take their time in a relationship and treat it as the serious matter it is will not get divorced. \n\n\nMy parents are divorced, so were the parents of my two best friends growing up, and my wife's parents are not divorced but they don't' get along. And none of this matters, it's all anecdotal. When you look at the larger trends, most people don't get divorced. \n\n\nThis is where [opportunity cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) comes in. Either you can raise kids in a stable, two parent household and spend ~18 years with the same person, or you can give up monogamy and be with lots of people. Neither of these is a bad option, but it's going to be very difficult to have both at the same time, and so you have to decide which is more important to you, and you may have to make sacrifices.

When he \"reinvents\" himself, the only way he knows how to create a public identity is through branding; that's why all of Batman's gadgets are so heavily bat-themed, and in the earlier versions of Batman even had a Bat- prefix.\n\nThroughout the history of Batman, the hero has refused to kill the villain and instead has him institutionalized or put in jail, from which the villain (the Joker, Scarecrow, etc.) inevitably escapes and returns to terrorize the city again, giving Batman an excuse to continue fighting crime. \n\nEverybody thinks Batman is really cool, but I think it's horrible because Batman is a symbol for corporate America bombarding us with hyper-charged caricatures of our culture and selling it to us as their \"brand\".

Wayne-corp doesn't openly sponsor batman, and batman doesn't advertise or promote any brand. He can't \"sell a brand\" if he's not selling anything.\n\nResponse B Author: MackDaddyVelli\n\nResponse B: Batman is a symbol, but not a corporate symbol.  Batman is a symbol of justice.  Batman is an *idea*, because ideas are more than people.  To quote the Batman himself: \"I am the reason the criminals breathe easier when the sun rises.\"\n\nHow exactly is Batman a corporate symbol?  The DC universe never shows Wayne Enterprises selling Bat-Grapples or Batmobiles.  Hell, to by knowledge we never even see Wayne Enterprises selling Batman toys or action figures.  Hell, even when Wayne Enterprises unveils Batman Incorporated, they're never making money off of the agents of BI.\n\n\nBatman has given numerous more plausible rationalizations for why he doesn't kill, including a number of strictly consequentialist arguments (as well as several based on duty or virtue, too).  He's not selling a brand -- he doesn't kill because killing is wrong.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author incruente's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: \nMy only purpose in this OP was to argue that one should not assert that a Big Mac is the same as a filet mignon, or that Uggs are just as good as Red Wings. It's ok to like low-quality things and they have their place. But asserting that they are 'the same' as their high-quality counterparts is wrong. \n\nA few caveats first: \n\n* Price is no indicator of quality. Great wine can be had for $10 and a $200 bottle can be utter crap. I am not suggesting that more expensive or rarer wine is better quality. \n\n* 'Everyone should acknowledge it' is not to say that everyone should instantly recognize and appreciate it. I, for instance, hate the taste of mushrooms: whether they're truffles or factory-grown button mushrooms. However, I can admit that, for people who appreciate and are well-versed in mushrooms, truffles are objectively 'better'. I would never suggest that there is no difference in these mushrooms or that people who claim to know the difference are lying. \n\nWhere I take issue are 'studies' like [this](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/wine-tasting-junk-science-analysis) and [this](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/drink/2011/11/why_you_should_be_drinking_cheap_wine.html) that assert that wine tasting is 'junk science' and that no one ('professional wine tasters' down to novices) can make an accurate value judgement as to the quality of a wine. I believe that, even if these 'studies' were accurate (which they're not), there still exists an objective standard of quality in wine that should impel the average consumer to avoid mass-produced grocery store wine and seek out 'quality' wines. \n\n* Objective levels of quality exist in every other food product, and it should be so with wine. Wine, like other alcohols (beer and spirits) is fundamentally an agricultural product. The quality of any agricultural product, be it produce, meat, eggs, vegetables, honey, etc. is highly dependent on the care taken by the agriculturalist and the quality of raw materials that the produce is given (sunlight, feed, fertilizer, etc.). We are all comfortable with grading eggs, meats, honey, and produce and assigning value depending on the grade. No one would argue, for instance, that chuck steak is the same as Prime, or that a seller who expects higher prices for a higher grade is attempting to deceive the public. It should be equally accepted that a vintner who foregoes chemical fertilizers and pesticides, who dry-farms instead of irrigates, and who only crops to a certain level should be recognized as a higher quality producer than a vintner who does not do these things. \n\n* Low-quality 'plonk' wine is detrimental to the environment, to workers, and to producers who might enact higher standards. *Vitis Vinifera* is a greedy plant. Left to its own devices, it will spread its root system across the topsoil, depleting mineral elements in about 3 years. In Italy, it is *illegal* to irrigate grape vines after their 1st year in the ground. However, large-scale macro-producers will water the hell out of their vines, rip out, and replant every three years to maximize crop yields. Large producers are also more likely to use chemical fertilizers and pesticides to increase yields, which may contaminate groundwater and streams. Further, large-volume production requires more labor, and lower wages to keep prices of the end-product low. This had lead to worker abuses and deaths in California in recent years. Sustainably-farmed, ethically-run wineries have been increasingly forced to abandon their practices to compete against these macro-producers, which degrades both the quality of the wine and it's sustainability across the industry.\n\n* Wine tasting is a 'science' and legitimate industry professionals *can* detect and correctly identify variation in wine. This is the area where I expect to be linked to all sorts of blogspam from Slate et al. detailing 'studies' that show that the wine industry is some sort of elaborate conspiracy to part fools from their money. First, let me qualify: there are three certifying bodies to which one's belonging qualifies one as a 'wine expert': the [Court of Master Sommeliers](http://www.mastersommeliers.org/), the [Society of Wine Educators](http://www.societyofwineeducators.org/) and the [Masters of Wine](http://www.mastersofwine.org/). If you are not part of one of these three bodies, *you. are. not. a. wine. expert*. In the same way that selling a house does not make you a Realtor, getting CPR certified does not make you a nurse, or defending yourself in court does not make you a lawyer, working in the wine industry, running a wine shop, sitting on a wine tasting panel, or simply liking to drink does not make you a 'wine expert'. Every 'study' I've ever been linked and read fails to qualify the 'experts' used in their study. Until I can see a study that says that Master Sommeliers, Masters of Wine, or Certified Wine Educators were unable to detect variations in wines, your studies are **bunk**. The Master Sommelier examination, which 171 people *in history* have passed, requires its applicants to know on which side of a hill the wine was grown. You can't seriously expect me to think that these people would be fooled with food coloring or a fake label. If legitimate professionals can discern wines from one another and place a value judgement, that judgement must must have a basis in reality.\n\nNone of the above is meant to suggest that everyone should drop their Two Buck Chuck and immediately start drinking DOCG Chianti, but consumers need to realize that the vast majority of their daily wine is akin to a McDonald's burger: pleasing, satisfying, but ultimately low-quality. There are objective quality standards to wine, the same way there are to any other food product. I have no problem with anyone drinking what they like, but pretending that they're 'beating the system' by drinking plonk and the rest of us are getting hosed by paying for quality is disingenuous. \n\nCMV.\n\n      \n\nResponse A Author: cyanoacrylate\n\nResponse A: Most food quality standards refer to healthiness or safety. Those are both definitely objective things. Those can be measured precisely and everyone will agree on them. That's drastically different from what you're saying - you're essentially arguing a tautology. \"Different wines are different!\" Sure, that's totally true. What's not necessarily true is that some of these differences are objectively better. It's largely a personal taste thing, and thus entirely subjective. \n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: your mistake is not objectively defining \"quality.\"  there can be objectively higher and lower quality products, as long as nowhere in the definition of quality do you include any subjective variables.  as soon as you introduce a subjective variable, you preclude objectivity.  *taste preference* is an example of a subjective variable.\n\nwine tasters, *at best*, may be able to detect subtle nuances in wine that clue them into any number of variables that they associate with their *beliefs* about wine quality (variety of grape, conditions of harvest, conditions of storage, age, etc), but this is in no way proves the existence of an objective standard of wine quality.  and it sounds like even *that* ability of wine tasters is scientifically unverified.\n\nit's also possible that a culture exists that wine tasters are typically indoctrinated into, where they all develop similar tastes, and so the majority of wine tasters might all agree that some wines actually *taste* better than others.  however, that is clearly not a random sample, and so the results are almost guaranteed to be biased.\n\nso you're right and you're wrong, depending on how you define quality.  if you objectively define quality, then it's a given that there is an objective difference between high quality and low quality.  if there are subjective variables in your definition, then the difference is *subjective* and no longer *objective*.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author cyanoacrylate's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: League of Legends is a game I believed plays based solely on catching opportunities and be able to do very small micromanagement (I will explain these this point later), and in order to succeed in knowing both these categories and execute them well, one need to have experiences in the realm of League game play, in simpler term, in order to be good at League one just need to play the game, the more they play the better they get at it. But when the matchmaking system pair experienced players with inexperienced ones, both parties expectations are not met because of their differences in skills thus both parties rage at one another.\n\nIn my personal experience with the match making system, more often than not, I get paired with newer players who have much less experience in the game, to clarify here is my stats:\n\n* 733 wins in normal\n\n* 345 wins in ranked\n\n* 720 game total in ranked\n\n\nWith a little over 1,400 games, anyone with similar experience would know where a ward should be place so that it would give the best vision, not just any place in the bush, it has to be in a certain area within the bush (top or bottom or middle of the bush depend on the the bush position in the map) and if a person is playing Alistar, they know to keep Riven away from the Adc. These are the very small micromanagement that I talked about, and having knowledge about these micro is a huge factor in deciding the game outcome.\n\nThus when an experienced player get into a team fight with the opposing team, he have a certain expectation of his team mates to do things that they are suppose to do. The key word here is expectation, every Adc expects their support to help them by either attacking the other priority target or by keeping the Dps and Assassin away from the Adc. Now again, these things are not taught in the tutorial and one must experienced it in the game in order to know this.\n\nWhen a player fail to meet these expectations, \"rage\" happens. The question often is \"Why?\" \"why didn't you do this, why didn't you do that\", they asks this because each player have an expectation of what another player should be doing, and each person's expectations is different based on their skill level in the game. An Adc with 50 games under his belt expects his support to act differently than an Adc with 400 games under his belt.\n\nThe issue with the match making system is that it paired experienced players with newer ones and the gaps are tremendous, (often I find my self playing with team mates less than 100 total wins in ranked, some even less than 30) and it is unfair to veteran players to lose a game because someone else is learning the rope.\n\nRage can happen to both parties, the experienced player and the inexperienced ones, some of the things that veterans of League does in a game (initiation, expecting follow ups, go for priority target) some time does not make sense to the inexperience players and vice-versa, so both parties rage at one another for not meeting their expectations.\n\nThe issue with the matchmaking system have been on my mind for a while now, I do not know if there are logistic in place for the matchmaking system or if it just match anyone to everyone, I just felt that this is a good place to put my thoughts process out there to see if anyone else think the same and I welcome any other ideas that would say other wise. I posted this in /r/leagueoflegends and did not get much respond or even a counter argument, I am hoping that it would be different here.\n\nTl:DR: Match making system pair experienced players with inexperienced players and everyone rage at each other for not doing what was expected from one another.\n\n\nThanks everyone for commenting, and a special thanks to /u/stipulation and /u/A_Soporific for adding onto the fundamental cause for rage of League of Legends.\n\nResponse A Author: A_Soporific\n\nResponse A: I would argue that the reason for the toxic community is because the game itself is bad. Quirks of the limited number of maps, errors in programming and character balancing, and highly specialized manufactured skills of the meta-game have long since replaced any sort of experimental strategy. There are now a handful of \"correct\" plays, and an invisible score sheet that all people are constantly being measured against. Better games tend to have a flexible meta-game that allow for different styles of play simultaneously or can allow for teamwork to overcome out of game weakness.\n\nIt's not that players need to be more understanding, it's that the game design requires players to conform to an ideal and punishes a group for the failure to adhere to that ideal. Naturally the group attempts to enforce that ideal, but isn't provided a constructive outlet to do so. If all you can do is yell at someone, you'll yell at that person.\n\nThe pressures felt in League of Legends aren't any different than the pressures felt in any other multiplayer game, the difference that leads to a near universal negative experience is the game itself and how it plays. I daresay that if you changed the matchmaking system the problems would persist because there will still be people less familiar with the meta of any specific champion and there isn't anything that anyone else can do about it.\n\nResponse B Author: UnhWut\n\nResponse B: Its not because of matchmaking. Its because the game is an hour long. You invest an hour and then lose because someone made a mistake. There are 5 people on your team and 5 people on the enemy team meaning that if a mistake is made then 90% of the time it isn't you if everyone is equally good/bad. This leads the players to think its not their fault.\n\nYou have some experience playing LoL, but it doesn't mean you are good. If everyone is 1300 Elo and you play like a 1500 Elo player, that means you will win more games then you lose, until you reach the point where you can't move up. That point is your true Elo.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author A_Soporific's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: I believe that homosexuality and Christianity are incompatible. That is, identifying as both a homosexual and a Christian is unjustifiable. It is evident that the bible takes an anti-homosexual stance. I am working under the assumption that all brands of Christianity accept every word written in the bible; otherwise, it seems that this would not be true Christianity.\n\nIt may be worth noting that I do not identify as either homosexual or Christian. I am posting this with hope that others can provide insight into my belief. Thank you.\n\n\nResponse A Author: kat-face\n\nResponse A: I don't think it's possible to be a true Christian if that means not breaking the laws of Christianity. The whole point of Christianity is that no one is able to fulfil the law, because we're all sinful. But it doesn't matter in terms of a Christian's salvation; Jesus died to take the punishment for sin so any person who repents and believes in that is saved, and thus sinless in God's eyes. Sure, Christians try not to sin because sin is against God's will and God knows what's best for us, and we want to please him, but at the end of the day all Christians sin because Christians are human.\n\nSin is not incompatible with Christianity, it's why we need it. Homosexual acts are a sin according to the Bible, but no more so than any other sin, and Christians are [told not to judge others for being a worse sinner that themselves.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%207:1-3&amp;version=NIV)\n\nIn my opinion, the issue with being a Christian and a homosexual isn't that it's a sin, it's that it's a conscious sin. To be a Christian and be in a homosexual relationship is to wake up every morning and decide to sin that day by continuing that relationship, rather than accidentally find yourself lying or bitching or whatever, it's premeditated.\n\nBut it's not my place, or your place to judge. Christianity, and any religion is about an individual's relationship with their God. If you're a homosexual Christian and are happy with that decision and feel God is too, then I'm in no place to say anything at all.\n\nDisclaimer: Am a Christian, not homosexual but going through a similar issue.\n\nResponse B Author: thewoodenchair\n\nResponse B: It seems like you have a tenuous grasp of Christianity as practiced by actual Christians. Here are my objections over your post:\n\n1. Christians who are against homosexuality don't hate homosexuals per se; they hate homosexual acts (ie hate the sin, no the sinner). Even among rabid homophobic sects and denominations, celibate/virgin homosexuals are often compared with kleptomaniacs who resist the urge to steal. In other words, they are lauded for resisting their ungodly urges. So already, a homosexual Christian isn't incompatible. They just have to be celibate.\n\n2. On a more theological level, everyone is supposed to be have sinned in the eyes of God. Everyone falls short in the eyes of God. And depending on the denomination, the \"everyone falling short\" part technically condemns everyone to hell. You're going to Hell for being gay, and you're going to Hell for being an asshole to people, and you're going to Hell for drinking too much, etc. That's basically the whole point of Jesus's crucifixion as espoused by Christians. His death is supposed to wash away the presence of sin or otherwise give Christian a fighting chance to enter Heaven. This is also why evangelicalism is a huge deal for Christians because the whole \"Jesus washing away your Hell damning sins\" only works if you actually believe in Jesus. Homosexual acts would just be another form of sin.\n\n3. Your edit of \"the laws of Christianity\" doesn't really make sense. There isn't a agreed upon \"law of Christianity.\" Christians don't agree with the version of Bible to use (KJV vs NIV). Depending on the denomination, there's sections of the Bible that gets replaced (The Catholic Bible has sections that's not found in the Protestant Bible and vice versa). And what about Mormons? They use the Old Testament and New Testament like most Christian denominations, but they also use an additional book called the Book of Mormon. So, does that mean they aren't Christian because they use an additional book?\n\n4. Another objection I have with your post is that religion isn't just \"stuff that we have to follow because it's written in this holy book.\" This is a fair point to mistaken as Protestants tend to focus on the Bible over other things like tradition, and most American Christians are Protestants, which means most American non-Christians are mostly exposed to Protestant Christianity (I'm assuming you're American). But this isn't necessarily true for all Christian denominations. Catholics stress tradition as well as the Bible. That's why Catholics have all these holidays celebrating saints and why Catholics venerate saints even though saints aren't referenced in the Bible at all. Religion exists among illiterate tribes of people, so a canon isn't a necessary condition for a religion. So, what are the traditions of the various Christian denominations? Well, that depends on the denomination. And not all of them will condemn homosexuals (Quakers, Presbyterians, etc).Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author kat-face's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: For those who genuinely like to change views, this thread is a good opportunity.  I'm ashamed to hold the view that I do -- it's a view I would not admit to my friends IRL, for example -- and would be happy to change.  \n\nMy attitude towards Google is entirely too grateful, admiring and uncritical.  I view them as a company that, while generally motivated by profit, also gives serious consideration to my best interests as an internet user, as well as to ideal of a free, open, interoperable internet, a world full of cool, convenient toys, and a body of human knowledge that is instantly and easily accessible.\n\nApologies in advance for this long post.  I want to explain all the reasons I hold my view so that you're informed, and hopefully successful, in your quest to change my view.  Anyways, while I understand that the following may read as though it should be chanted in a cult initiate's voice, I love Google because:\n\n**1.  Google is generous.**\n\nI know that Google is an advertising company, and that giving stuff away for \"free\" and advancing the cause of free/accessible information are part of Google's business model.  Still, Google creates more and better stuff, and monetizes that stuff less aggressively, than a purely profit-driven approach would dictate.  It also allocates capital towards projects that are \"cool\" but not highly profitable (if they're profitable at all). For example:\n\n* When gmail first became available, its competitors were hotmail, which offered users 2MB storage, and yahoo, which offered 4MB. Google could have trumped with 6 or 8, and probably captured the market with 20. Instead, it provided *1,000\u2014a gigabyte.* It doubled that a year later and promised \u201cto keep giving people more space forever.\u201d  Google scans users' email for advertising purposes in real time, so this large archive was not essential to its ad revenue model. Sure, Google wanted to make a bold grab for market share, but it also wanted to give people a great thing they hadn't previously envisioned -- a *better* web-based email service -- and it gave them that thing for free, even though it could have commanded just as many eyeballs for ads with a less impressive offering. \n\n* Google Earth gives you the godlike experience of holding the earth in your hand, and lets you swoop in and \"visit\" any location.  This cannot have been cheap to put together.   There are no ads on it. \n \n* Google voice is free and incredibly useful. No ads.  \n\n* Google is developing weather balloons to provide internet to the *entire world.*  It's easy to envision how this could profit them in the very, very long run, but no corporate strategist would call it a safe or wise investment when compared to other potential uses of company capital. \n\n**2. Google embodies intellectual brilliance and innovation.**\n\nLet me know if you want support for this and I'll elaborate, but I think it's an obvious point. Yes, you could say the same about several other tech companies, but Google is one of the biggest and best in this vein.\n\n**3.  Google respects its users.**\n\nFor example:\n\n* While many search engines have tried to capture market share from Google over the years, they (e.g. Bing) have focused on making search more conversational and user-friendly for stupid people rather than adding features that *actually made search more intelligent and useful.*  In other words: features like word-proximity searches, the ability to search for numbers within a wildcard range, etc.  They reasoned  that most users were too unsophisticated to levergage these features or care about them. Google, despite its dominant competitive position and relative lack of a need to innovate in order to retain market share, added these features anyways.\n\n* Google, like Facebook and many other companies, profits from selling your information and could probably increase its profits by behaving like Facebook vis-a-vis privacy features -- constantly hiding and changing and rearranging these settings to thwart users who care about them. Google refrains because it respects you too much to act like an asshole.  Google even supports adblock in chrome.  \n\n* Unlike Apple, which assumes that \"Apple knows best\" and its users need to be \"protected from\" their own distasteful interest in porn (or, god forbid, device hacking/customization), Google invites you to take the great tools and toys it's made and do your own thing with them. \n\n**4.  Google respects its employees.** \n\nEven compared to other Silicon Valley firms, Google is famed for its casual, non-authoritarian corporate culture, for giving its employees great perks and for funding their personal pet projects.  \n\n\n**5.  Google is a bold, disruptive business -- in a good way.**\n\nWhen Google began digitizing and copying books, it knew that the copyright laws governing its activity were ambiguous and the project presented substantial legal risk.  Given the unattractive risk-reward ratio of the project, most companies would not have proceeded.  According to tech journalist Stephen Levy, Google went forward because it [considered its intentions honorable and the law outmoded.](http://books.google.com/books?id=V1u1f8sv3k8C&amp;pg=PA359&amp;lpg=PA359&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cand+the+way+the+laws+are+structured+isn%E2%80%99t+really+sensible.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BRvL9p8pjz&amp;sig=sSVTWr4zzTKKtj1aSab9-OS5l5o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XIPhUqeRK-eD4ASCnYHABA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cand%20the%20way%20the%20laws%20are%20structured%20isn%E2%80%99t%20really%20sensible.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false). This was bold.\n\nMore recently, Google began offering fiber optic internet *for free.*  Like the weather balloon project, it's easy to imagine that this *could* profit Google in an uncertain, distant future assuming many \"ifs\" fall into place.  Google Fiber is nonetheless a bold move to which the buzzword \"disruptive\" certainly applies, as it disrupts ISPs' ability to essentially spit on their users via throttled speeds, shitty TOS and exorbitant rates.  Economists will tell you that the telecom pipes market is a \"natural monopoly\" or natural oligopoly, meaning it's not a wise idea for a new entrant to challenge an entrenched incumbent.  \"Fuck that,\" says Google.  Google is also challenging ISP throttling with its new youtube speed rankings.\n\n\nI've sometimes sought out counterarguments to my view.  I've heard the arguments below, but am unconvinced by them so far:\n\n**1.  Google spies on your and exploits your information for profit.**  This is true, but as a Google user I know what I'm getting into -- it's a consensual, contractual arrangement.  Also, Google gives you some straightforward opt-out toggles and supports chrome extensions that let you opt out more comrpehensively.  Finally, while I dislike NSA spying because the government could misuse this information to hassle me at the airport or investigate me for a crime, Google just wants to aggregate my data and optimize  ads to sell me stuff.  I'm bothered by the idea of a domestic security state that indefinitely detains people and imprisons them for nonviolent drug crimes, but I'm not bothered by the idea of people trying to sell me stuff. You could also argue that *Google is complicit in some NSA spying*, but I trust that Google has resisted this within the bounds of the law.  Why?  Because it's in Google's commercial interest to give its users the things they want, which means email that lacks a government backdoor.  \n\n**2. Filter bubble.**  Easily avoided if you care about it.  I'm not concerned.\n\n**3. Largely thanks to google, user-tracking and advertising algorithms have become so smart that [the rich see a different internet than the poor](http://sams.scientificamerican.com/article/rich-see-different-internet-than-the-poor/), to potentially exploitative ends.**   I am a rich libertarian and not particularly bothered by this.  Plus, ad companies have always mined demographic data and attempted to target ads at certain income groups.  The rich already see a different media advertising landscape than the poor.  \n\n**4.  Merely by archiving so much information about you -- even if it never intends to misuse that information -- google creates a data honeypot that could be sought out and exploited by others.  For example, in a nasty custody dispute, your ex could subpoena your porn searches.**  This is one of the better arguments I've heard, but I can't muster the urge to blame Google for this problem.  The exploitative forces that seek the data -- such as the judge in the custody dispute, or the NSA in the domestic spying context -- are to blame for their own actions.  \n\n**5.  Google is a massively profitable corporation that mostly advances its own bottom line while maintaining a decent corporate culture and throwing an occasional bone to users.  You shouldn't venerate them for this -- you should consider it the bare minimum of decent behavior and hold other corporations to the same standard.  Just because Comcast is terrible doesn't mean Google is a benevolent god.**   Honestly, this is what I would post if I were responding to my own CMV.  But the fact is, nothing *requires* Google to be decent.  I think I feel an immense sense of gratitude toward them because in many situations -- SOPA, ISP throttling, a market full of inadequate and simplistic search products and locked-down, dumbed-down operating systems,  a world that seems to care less and less every day about freedom, openness and individual agency -- Google speaks up for you when other powerful interests do not. Google is fighting good fights, pushing computer science forward, and creating a smarter and more efficient world. \n\nI know how saccharine this view sounds, so please change it!  \n\n*formatted for readability\n\nResponse A Author: McKoijion\n\nResponse A: Google has traditionally been an amazing company, but it has lost some its friendly start-up character as it's gotten older. It used to be that engineers ran the place. They made cool stuff and gave it away for cheap, because Google's search engine made so much money that they could afford to try out random stuff.\n\nNow as the company is older, they had to start promoting those engineers to management positions, and not all of them took to their new roles very well. On top of that, Google started hiring a lot more consulting/banking business types. They are starting to expect returns on their investments on their fun stuff, and are finding ways to squeeze every dollar out of their ads. Finally, many of the truly creative developer types are leaving/have left to get involved with new start-ups. As a result, the culture has started to seriously decline.\n\nA good example is the recent fiasco with Youtube. In the guise of improving the site, they put in more ads, reduced the download speeds, and forced people to sign up for their failed Google+ product to register for the site. You can tell that those decisions were made by executive types rather than engineers that are truly trying to make the best experience for their users. This isn't really Google's fault. It happens to all companies. Remember that Microsoft was the most prestigious/profitable/innovative company in the world for a while too.\n\nSo Google is pretty good, but they are on the decline. I don't mean that you should sell your stock or anything, but they aren't the company we used to love anymore.\n\nResponse B Author: thekingearl\n\nResponse B: Google does not respect it's users. At least in terms of letting users decide what content they want to view when they complete a search. Google, like most search engines, \"bubbles\" its search results. It's why you and another user often come up with different results at the top of a Google search. Based off of your search history, links you click, etc the results will be different. The more Google learns about you the more the results will be tailored towards what it thinks you'll like rather than unbiased results.\n\nNow there's a line of thinking that could argue that learning what you want is a good thing .I would prefer to have unbiased results myself, but you could argue you prefer the other and there's nothing inherently \"bad\" about it. But the same data process is used to run Google Ads, the same annoying pop-up ads that follow you from site to site and it always seems to be the same ones. So their only motive on bubbling you is to make money. Not to somehow make your searches better for you. They send who searches what from where, who clicks what from where (where being both where on the internet and where in the world on a map) to anyone they do business with.\n\nBut they have to make money right? I mean that's the name of the game? Sure. But then don't act all self-righteous when people get pissed off when you hand data about them to the NSA. \"There was nothing we could do!\" Yes there was. Don't collect the data in the first place. If Google wasn't bubbling everyone they wouldn't have anything to hand the NSA. So if you're at all upset about the U.S. government having data about you personally, you can partially thank Google and know that they did that not because \"their hands were tied\" but because they could make more money and if they had to give the data to Feds too oh well.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author McKoijion's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Anyway, it goes without saying that we couldn't eat them all, so we decided to give away some to a homeless person.  \n\nAnyway, I told him that we bought the 100 cheeseburgers partly to kinda smalltalk and partly so he understood why we would just hand him a bag of food and let him take what he wanted...\n\nBut later when we talked, my friends told me that they thought it was kinda douchbaggy to tell him that we bought that many cheeseburgers, because I was implying that we had more money than him and that we had the luxury of being able to buy as much food as we wanted. Also, he could be thinking we could have just gived him the money..\n\nBut my point was that just by giving him anything implies we have more money than him, and by wearing fancy cloth of a total value much greater than the cheeseburgers was also saying that we have more resources than him. So he could probably figure out that we have the money to buy the cheeseburgers. Besides, I don't think beggars can be choosers, and I don't think he is to decide what I use my money for..\n\nChange my view!\n\nTL;DR: we bought 100 cheeseburgers and gave some to a homeless person.

Telling the man that you bought more food at one time than be has probably seen in awhile doesn't add anything. In fact, there is the  possible outcome that it will just piss him off. Sometimes things are just better left unsaid. It doesn't make you a douche, but it allows the perception of you as a douche.

I really don't see the appeal of hooking up with the same sex, but I don't see why I should get in the way of those who do. Gay people are still people, and to treat someone like crap just because they aren't like you is just a down-right dirty thing to do.\n\nHomophobes are people too. I don't agree with what they do or what they believe in, but how does treating them like crap make me any better? I think homophobes are flawed, no doubt, but I think it best to look past a persons flaws and accept the good in them.\n\nI really don't understand this witch hunt people have going on. If you respond to a difference in opinion with a backlash of hate and rage, what benefit does that have? Why would a person want to listen to somebody who treats them badly? Whenever somebody lashes out at me, I feel no need to listen to what they have to say.\n\nOn the other hand, if you prove yourself to be a good friend, they just must be willing to hear what you have to say. It's almost like leading by example. I mean, they might think \"Wow, even though this guy didn't agree with me, he still treated me nice and was a good friend. Maybe just because I don't like the idea of being gay, doesn't mean gay people are bad\". \n\nAnd maybe they don't come around. You can still have a friend with which you can agree to disagree. That's still better than making enemies.\n\nResponse A Author: rampazzo\n\nResponse A: I don't necessarily disagree with you, as I believe everyone should be respected, but here is the argument I think makes the most sense with regards to why it may be ok (in the minds of many) to respect homophobes less than other people: Homophobes are not respectful of everyone. Since homophobes are not respectful of everyone simply for being human, many people consider them fair game to disrespect. Esseintially they forfeit their right to be respected by disrespecting others. I think this argument is a little hypocritical, at least how I phrased it, but it isn't entirely irrational. I am an American, and we tend to value freedom, but you quite simply can't have every freedom out there. You cannot allow all people to be free to have jobs and live where they like while also allowing perfect freedom to discriminate on the part of employers and landlords. Therefore the United States has been (slowly) siding more and more with limiting the freedoms that limit other freedoms. This is not the exact same thing but it is similar. Essentially the thought goes that we should respect the beliefs of all others, but when there is a conflict we will respect those who disrespect others less than those who don't.\n\nThe part that doesn't convince me is that it assumes that respect is some limited thing that cannot be given out to everyone (as opposed to freedom which clearly can't), whereas I believe that it is possible to respect people who have radically different beliefs than I do. That being said, I do not respect all people equally. I have a fair amount of respect for everyone, but there are definitely some people who I respect more than others and some I hold in slightly lower regard. This is often a factor of a nubmer of things about a person. I value traits like kindness, loyalty, leadership, a good work ethic, creativity, intelligence, and open-mindedness, to name a few. When someone is pretty bad at some of these things I tend to respect them a little less than someone who displays them quite well. Homophobes are terribly closed-minded. I honestly find it impossible to respect a homophobe as much as another person who is equally respectable in every other way. It is definitely a knock against them. I try my best not to belittle them and to treat them with human decency (hold the door open, smile and be polite, be friendly, etc.), but only because I do that to everyone. I do not respect them enough to take most of their opinions seriously, at least on the topic of society and laws.\n\nWith regards to the \"witch-hunt\" I am actually not very bothered by it. I strongly believe that gay people should have equal rights, and a large and growing number of people agree with me. There are still many people who don't but it is becoming increasingly more difficult for them to be open about it, which I see as a good thing. The message being sent is that it is not ok to be homophobic. Maybe it is not being sent in the nicest of ways as it tells homophobes that their beliefs are not ok (which is always hard to hear and tends to make people defensive as you noted) but it is an important message to send and I would rather it happen poorly than not at all.\n\nResponse B Author: a__grue\n\nResponse B: I fail to see the logic or even perspective of this argument. Everyone is allowed their opinion.  What matters is how people *act* on that opinion.\n\nGroup A both vocalizes and takes action to prevent Group B's rights - rights which affect Group A *in no way whatsoever*.\n\nWhen people tell Group A to shut the hell up and leave Group B alone to live their own lives, you call this a \"witch hunt\"?  What do you call it when Group A vocalizes hatred toward and tries to limit the rights of Group B?\n\nI would really like someone to explain the \"Don't discriminate against my discrimination!\" line of thinking to me some time in some way that doesn't sound like nothing but absolute crazy-person babble.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author rampazzo's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

In fact I believe those sacrifices were made in vain.\n\nThe Second World War can be seen as a black-and-white moral struggle against monstrously oppressive forces. The soldiers who gave their lives in that conflict can legitimately be seen as laying their lives down to oppose fascism and protect some basic institutions of human freedom.\n\nI do not believe the same can be said for the First World War. In my view, it was an impersonal struggle between empires over territory which had no moral component. I do not believe that the majority of individuals fighting in the trenches had any personal stake in the outcome. It was a hugely pointless waste of life and human suffering which certainly did not improve anyone's lives or prospects. Furthermore, the brutal punishment meted out to the German people afterwards caused decades of misery and directly opened the door to Nazism.\n\nSo, what are the arguments against that point of view?\n\n\nResponse A Author: TulipsMcPooNuts\n\nResponse A: There's a few positive things that happened as a result of World War 1:\n\n* Greater respect for women and women entered the workforce\n\n* Acknowledgement of workers rights\n\n* The Ottoman Empire collapsed\n\n* It changed the world view on imperialism, led to the decline of colonization  \n\n* Technology advanced by leaps and bounds (cars and airplanes)\n\n* The League of Nations was formed which was the pre-cursor to the UN\n\n* The US further established itself as a world power and industry BOOMED\n\n* The world realized how horrifying use of chemical weapons was\n\n* Further solidified alliances between nations that would later participate in WW2\n\n* Arguably, you could apply all the benefits of WW2 to WW1 as a big part of the factors that led to WW2 happened because of WW1\n\nNow whether all of this was worth it is another story. I'm not sure what exactly you are looking for, was there more positive than negatives to the war? Are you looking for a justification of the war? If you take a good look at the state of world affairs at the time, a war was imminent, no matter what. I don't believe the the war was worth the suffering, but to say that nothing positive happened because of it is a little disingenuous. \n\nAs a side note, should check out this youtube channel. Which releases a video every week for **4 years** that explains exactly the how, why, what of the First World War in real time as it happened in that week.

Their collapse freed most of Eastern Europe from domination by a foreign power, a situation that had lasted centuries.\n\nAnother result you might call positive is that the world 'lost its innocence': for the first time, ordinary people began to seriously question their governments, who had promised them glory and victory, and had delivered wholesale slaughter instead. French generals shelled their own troops for refusing to leave the trenches to be mowed down by enemy machine guns.\n\nFinally, U.S. President Wilson made the foundation of the League of Nations happen, the first concrete step toward world government and the aim of world peace. It's tragic but true that worldwide bloodshed was needed to create the notion of worldwide cooperation.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author TulipsMcPooNuts's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: I've held this opinion for some time, but it has come into contention among my friends recently, with regards to the impending blocking of online porn in the UK unless you decide to opt in to it. Of course, being a 17 year old male and *against* porn makes me a minority, but nevertheless, I have not been persuaded to change my opinion.\n\nI believe that pornography is too readily available to young children, who are viewing it at increasingly lower ages, partially due to the increased number of computer tablets children have access to now. This actually makes them able to access porn by accident and without prior knowledge of what it is. Blocking porn by default would solve this 'accident' issue.\n\nMore importantly, the 'opt in' system would open up pornography to discussion. When I got my first computer, my parents talked to me about porn and how women aren't really how they appear in the films and men aren't all that well endowed. I still watched some, but wasn't so amazed by it, since I knew it wasn't an accurate replication of sex. I feel that communication is key to addressing the fixation some people have on porn and to the issues associated with that fixation. Furthermore, the fact that most teenagers don't want their parents to know about their viewing of porn suggests that they feel it is a bad thing to be doing.\n\nWhile I think that communication is the main solution to the problems with violence and unhealthy obsessions associated with pornography, a 'default block' is certainly the best thing to do about it right now.\n\nSo, uh, change my view please.\n\n**TLDR: A porn block would promote conversation about porn and its dangers and stop accidental viewing by young children.**\n\n[Here's a bit of info about what's happening in the UK.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23401076)\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: Why is shielding children from sexuality, and unintentionally creating or reinforcing an obsession with it later in life, a priority for you? \n\nThe fact that most teenagers don't want anything they do known by their parents would suggest that every teenager is always doing bad things?....

To me they are not things that require some moral label like good/bad, etc... one's sexuality is their own business.\n\nHowever, I can't notice that the people who really support gay marriage are really turning it into something it's not: an issue of \"rights\". People like to talk about innate human rights, but really, the notion of \"rights\" only makes sense from a legal perspective and thus, requires backing from the legal documentation of the country. AFAIK the Constitution doesn't explicitly support or condemn gay marriage - however, supporters of gay marriage frequently claim that not allowing it is \"violating rights\" and they even compare it to the Civil Rights movement of the 60s, which I find really shocking. The main difference is that for blacks, the systematic discrimination was impacting their ability to enjoy the right to life, liberty, etc... for instance, how can people work when the only factory in town won't hire them because of their skin? To me, stuff like segregation/slavery/etc. was a LOT bigger than the things proponents of \"gay rights\" complain about.\n\nHere are things gay people have to worry about:\n\n- Not being able to marry their same-sex partner. While this is a bummer for them, it's not their \\*right* to get married. I know a lot of people say things like \"the gov't can't tell me who I can and can't love!\" which is a ridiculous Strawman of the issue. I've seen some couples that deeply love each other but are not married, and the reverse as well. Marriage != love. Marriage is a specifically-defined institution for the region in which it is considered legally relevant. So when people are getting gay marriage legalized, they're not giving gays more rights, they're just changing that state's definition of what a legal marriage is.\n\n- The \"Christian cake-baker\" - there have been a number of cases where someone refuses to perform a service for a gay couple's wedding due to their religious beliefs. They don't ban gays from their store, and they don't pledge to never serve a gay. They just don't want to support a gay marriage. The thing is, people like this are in the extreme minority and most would prefer they couple's money. They can easily take their business elsewhere, so how is the couple really being harmed by this? I'd say it's more harmful to force the religious person to compromise their beliefs.\n\n- Sodomy laws. I guess this is an \"issue\", but as far as I know this law is less enforced than the 55 MPH speed limit. Many states have officially repealed them, and I doubt anyone would actually get arrested for it. I'd say that this would in fact be a violation of rights as it concerns private, self-contained behavior - but the law is entirely archaic and unenforced.\n\nTo me, these things are definitely not on the level of what blacks fought for decades ago, and comparing the legalization of gay marriage to this is a disgrace to those noble fighters such as MLK, Rosa Parks, etc... the current \"gay movement\" isn't about gays getting made equal to straight people, it's just about gays getting what they want - which isn't bad mind you, it just isn't the same as fighting inequality.\n\nResponse A Author: NobodySpecific\n\nResponse A: Why shouldn't gay couples be allowed to get on each other's insurance? My company only offers insurance to married couples and families, a domestic partership is not good enough. Why should gay couples be forced to file taxes as single people for their entire life together? This can result in a higher tax burden than a heterosexual couple that is allowed to marry. Why shouldn't gay couples be allowed to make medical decisions on their partner's behalf should something happen to them? Due to HIPAA, doctor's might not be able to share any sensitive medical information with a person's partner. They are in a coma? Well, best we can tell you is that they are in critical but stable condition. He can't speak to authorize you to visit, so you have to wait out here until official visiting hours start to see him and we can't tell you anything else. Why shouldn't gay couples automatically be able to inherit their partner's property when they die? Yes, a will can be made, but if a married partner dies with no spouse their estate should go to the partner. Without that marriage the estate will likely just go to relatives. Why should gay couples not be afforded the right to not testify against a spouse? The US legal system has protections in place such that the right to remain silent so as to not incriminate yourself extends to your married partner as well. No marriage? Then you could face obstruction or contempt charges for not speaking.\n\nWhy is marriage something that is only offered to straight couples? It reduces their tax burden and gives them decision making power in times of crisis. It also gives them protections when bad things happen.\nWhy should straight couples be offered more than gay couples? Until I hear a good reason as to why straight couples deserve more than gay couples I will fight ardently for equal rights. Call them whatever you want, but minimizing them by saying that inequality in marriage laws does nothing to stop people from loving each other completely misses the issue.\nThat is the crux of the argument for gay marriage.\n\nResponse B Author: excultist\n\nResponse B: If homosexuals are not given the same rights as heterosexuals, then the law is officially relegating them to the status of second class citizens.  You claim that gay rights are not protected by the constitution, but human rights are; all citizens should enjoy equal rights.  And although you may consider it to be unimportant whether two people who love each other are allowed to marry or not, a large number of other rights (as has been mentioned in several other replies) are conferred by marriage, including insurance, pension, visitation in hospitals, etc.  The fact that two people can be fully committed to each other as partners, yet have no legal standing of any kind, creates ridiculous situations.  Two people can be together for 50 years, and when one of them dies, the other has no say in the funeral arrangements, which are determined instead by a second cousin, the closest relative.  And then the partner is deliberately excluded from the funeral.  These things do happen.  Marriage, aside from its own intrinsic importance, is also a signal, that society does accept a relationship.  It is a means of fighting homophobia.  You must be aware that homosexuals are widely persecuted, and have often been assaulted and in all too many cases, driven to suicide.  This is not a trivial problem.  And you are not immune to this problem, either.  Heterosexuals *also* get assaulted on the mere suspicion of homosexuality (a charge which never has to be proved; after all, you could always be a secretive, closeted homosexual).  So the whole society becomes more paranoid, when homophobia is socially tolerated.  If you do not want a homophobic society, then you should support the right of same-sex couples to marry.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author NobodySpecific's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Though they occupy the dangerous bottom rungs of American society, your average American American is still better fed, better housed, more connected, and more mobile than any other African group. In addition, nobody is going to doubt that they're a citizen in the wealthiest, most powerful nation on Earth... a privilege that undocumented Latinos do not enjoy as non-citizens. While there is still much progress to be made as far as inequality goes, African Americans have come a long way since slavery. Though a big portion of slaves suffered through the 19th Century, their cousins in colonized Africa had it even worse, in the long run. Two wrongs don't make a right, but African Americans, today, are relatively privileged to their African counterparts, and in this manner also benefit from the legacy of slavery, as white people do. Not saying they benefit equally, but history is still being written, and racial progress is occurring, however slowly.

If someone does something worthy of respect we can encourage that behavior by calling it dignified. On the other hand, if someone does something bad but not technically *morally wrong*, we might be able to discourage that behavior by calling it undignified. Using the concept of dignity properly is all about properly identifying what should and should not be considered acts worthy of respect.

Any income that retired people have can only, ultimately, come from the people that are still working.\n\nHow many workers do you need to support 1 retiree? Well, let's say that every worker pitches in 10% of their income, and that retirees can live on half of what a worker can live on due to owning a home, having fewer expenses, etc., etc.\n\nThat would mean that you need 5 workers for every retiree, or the system simply can't support itself. \n\nThe consequence of that, though, is that the life expectancy of someone at retirement can't possibly go much higher than 1/5 of one's working life. If you start work after college, and work until you're 62, that's 41 years. \n\nThis means that your scheme can only possibly work, mathematically if people's life expectancy at age 62 is no more than 70.2 years, unless the working people are paying significantly more. If we take 20% of everyone's earnings, we could deal with life expectancy being 78.3 (which is about where it is today).\n\nIs it worth that?

CMV\n\nOp: So since you're reading this, you probably haven't come to the direct conclusion that I'm a monster thank you. \nSeeing all the new attention that has been placed on \"anti-bullying\" campaigns in school where educators tell students terrible stories about a student who committed suicide, I feel like too much padding is being placed around this generation.\nDon't get me wrong, kids should still be taught that it is wrong to make fun of others simply for one of their characteristics, this is an important life lesson. I just feel like kids nowadays are becoming softer and softer so soft in fact, that they feel like because they are being called fat in school, the only way out is to kill themselves. Ok that was a shallow statement, bullying goes WAAYYY farther than that, but my point still stands, kids should, as well as being taught not to make fun of each other, be taught that suicide is never the only answer.\nAlso, bullying always has two sides. As sinister and evil as it may sound, the kid being made fun may also be partially wrong in a \"bullying case\". Take this recent huge Amanda Todd deal. It was ALL OVER the news about how bullying caused this girl to take her life.

Now, if you want to look up treatments for these kinds of disorders, you'll notice that \"tough love\" doesn't work as a treatment, and in fact, makes them worse. Now, granted, I have come across a few teenage dumbasses who thought suicide is \"cool\", but I doubt that those are the people who are the main suicidal demographic. Look at the countries with the highest suicide rates (Japan and South Korea). Bullying isn't the main perpetrator, but it does make things worse. \n\nResponse B Author: Yxoque\n\nResponse B: I'm going to assume you've never been bullied yourself. \n\nBeing bullied does not mean you are weak. Being bullied means that some kid saw an opportunity for social advantage or fun by fucking you over.\n\nBeing bullied is not just one kid messing with another kid. It's generally a couple of kids (helped by the complete apathy of all others) abusing the social structure of a classroom to break one person. \n\nMost kids that are bullied are on their own. Even if they have a couple of friends, those friends generally won't be willing to face the tyranny of the rest of the class. They are mentally and physically attacked the entire time they are at school (and they are forced to go to school anyway) and nowadays it doesn't just stop when the kids get home. They can't tell an adult, because adults will minimize the acts as \"just teasing\" or tell the bullied they \"just need to man up\". Not to mention there is great social pressure to not be a \"snitch\". You can't respond with violence, because then *you*'ll get punished and even then it's just you against a group.\n\nIf you've never been bullied you probably can't even begin to understand the feeling of loneliness and not belonging in a social group. It's hard to understand how the continuous pressure can make you feel like it actually is your own fault. How you deserve to be mocked and attacked. How you are as worthless and stupid as your bullies tell you you are. \n\nBullying is abuse. Plain and simple. People shouldn't accept abuse because it's common and people shouldn't accept abuse because it's just kids.\n\n**Imagine this.** Everyday, before you go to school/work, five guys come up to you. They're massive. All of them look like they could kick your ass seven times over. And without saying anything or explaining why, one of them will punch you, hard. Then they'll go away. The first time you're like: \"What the fuck just happened.\" When you get at work/school, you tell a friend. That friends advices you to not go to the police, because it will just make things worse. Also, he's not going out for a drink with you anymore, because he doesn't want to get punched as well. \n\nEvery day after this one, you get punched. And worse than that, those guys started turning up in the weirdest places. You don't even feel safe at home. Eventually, you decide to tell the cops, despite what your friends told you. The cops tell you they can't do anything if they didn't see it happen. Or they tell you that it's probably not that bad. Just a couple of guys having fun.

However, at the moment, they're the best we have.\n\nThe ACT and SAT exams are used to compare students.  Very simply, it is a numerical number used to compare one student's ability to do well on the test to another.  Because grades are different everywhere, it is important to have some standard number on a college application to compare apples to apples.\n\nA core component of the SAT and especially the ACT is the time constraints.  Given a really long time, most students could do extremely well on the test. However, students have to be able to think quickly to answer the questions in the given time.\n\nIf the point of the test is to be able to compare one student to another, why should extra time be allotted?  Yes a student will struggle if they have a learning disability, but that disability is not going to go away, and tests are not going to get easier at the collegiate level.\n\nI think that this is an important issue.  Students with extra time WILL do much worse without it.  However, if this were to happen, it would reveal the underlying issue with the college application process:  ACTs and SATs, in my opinion, are important, but they aren't all a student brings to the table.  There's a lot of things in a student's profile, and there needs to be more holistic ways to measure this (outside of a testing environment), and these methods need to be valued by college admissions officers\n\nResponse A Author: neetupatel\n\nResponse A: \nYes that would be beneficial for everyone if college admission officers viewed more than just scores and grades, but that isn't really the case currently in the real world. Therefore students with learning disabilities need a fair chance to take the SAT or ACT so that they excluded compared to the rest of the students. If that means giving them extra time so that they can fully comprehend the test, then they should be given the help.

Because it's the only way in this system to fairly gauge how well a LD student knows high school curriculum compared to a non-LD student.

It's tempting to dismiss people as not \"true Christians\" but really you're falling into a scotsman-type fallacy.

For some it is divine law, for others it is a guidebook written by humans. \n\nSimilarly, the Bible isn't the same for all Christians. The Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, and Mormon Bibles are all very different. \n\nThe way the Bible is interpreted is also very different. For example, an evangelical will claim that Genesis is a scientific account that contradicts evolution while a Catholic will tell you that Genesis is a vehicle of spiritual wisdom that supplements the scientific facts of evolution.  \n\nChristians don't agree on what the Bible is, whether or not the it actually condemns homosexuality or if it even matters.\n\n\nFurthermore, many Christians argue that all people are sinners.

It's just a regressive tax.\n\nOp: I've heard it said that inflation is considered a sound fiscal policy by regulatory bodies. But how can this be so? If the general money supply is increased by, say, 3% each year, with all the \"new\" money going to the government, how is this any different from the government taxing everyone 3%? Everyone's buying power goes down by 3%, while the government's buying power goes up by whatever everyone else lost. So why is this considered \"sound fiscal policy\", when it's just a regressive tax, which is generally frowned upon in the first place?\n\n\nResponse A Author: ___OccamsChainsaw___\n\nResponse A: Well first of all in the modern world inflation *isn't* used as fiscal policy. *Inflation targeting* is monetary policy. Second, the creation of new money in and of itself is not inflation. Inflation is a rise in the general price level. If the monetary base expands but prices stay constant, than inflation has not occured. Third, the new money doesn't usually go to the government, unless the central bank is buying government debt. Most new money is created by private banks in the form of credit. The central bank (i.e., the Fed) can incent this money creation through its influence over interest rates, or it can purchase financial assets and create money directly. Fourth, over the long-run, incomes increase to match inflation *cet par*, so as long as inflation is low (~3% or less) and stable, it isn't a problem at all. \n\n Inflation is intentional in most if not all developed nations, usually targeted^1 at 2% for at least three reasons: \n\n1. So in the advent of an economic emergency, the central bank can target a real interest rate below zero (real interest rate^2 = nominal interest rate^2A - expected inflation) so to prompt investment and stimulate the economy. \n\n2. To avoid deflation. If we have deflation, the real value of debt increases over time (your $400,000 mortgage may, in real terms, become a $400,400 mortgage a year later unexpectedly, and this is bad), prompting a reduction in spending which will reduce the demand for money which will exacerbate the deflations and so on until the economy is in shambles. \n\n3. To allow for a more robust labour market. Wages are downwardly rigid (employers have a hard time reducing the wages of existing employees as those employees do not like their wages being cut), so the price of labour tends to be higher than is efficient during a downturn. Workers do not react nearly so poorly to real reductions in wages as they do nominal ones (a 2% nominal wage increase and 4% inflation is the same as a 2% wage cut and no inflation, but workers only react poorly to the latter), so inflation can help employers lower wages when they need to without their workers getting angry. \n\n\n^(1. The central bank does this by creating more money through various mechanisms. The value of money is subject to its supply and demand just like anything else.) \n\n^(2. The interest rate when inflation is accounted for.)\n\n^(2A. The interest rate when inflation is not accounted for. If the interest rate on a bank account for example is 2% and the rate of inflation is 4%, the real interest rate is actually -2%.) \n\nResponse B Author: McKoijion\n\nResponse B: I think you know part of the story about inflation, but you are missing some important parts of the puzzle. It might be easier to go over to /r/explainlikeimfive, but I'll try to explain it here.\n\nLike a lot of things in economics, inflation is about supply and demand. If the economy is good and people are spending money, then the amount of money in circulation increases, and if the supply of money in circulation increases, then the value of money decreases. This is called inflation. On the other hand, if the economy is bad and people are hoarding money, then the supply of money in circulation will decrease, and the value of money will go up. This is deflation. \n\nThis is why 2-3% inflation is considered good. If the economy is good and people are spending money, then there will be 2-3% inflation independent of any government intervention. People's bank accounts are the source of the extra money, not the government. If the inflation rate is lower, it means people aren't spending money, which is bad. If it is higher, it means there is an underlying economic problem causing the excess inflation.\n\nAs for the government, they have four ways to affect the supply of money, which in turn affects the inflation rate.\n\n1. They can make a law that requires banks to hold more money in their safes. This means less money is available for the banks to lend to people, which decreases the supply of money.\n\n2. When banks need loans, they have to get it from the Federal Reserve. If the Fed gives out really low interest loans, the banks can give out low interest loans too. This means more people will get the loans, and this will increase the supply of money and the inflation rate. If the Fed give out high interest loans, then there will be deflation.\n\n3. The government buys and sells government bonds. If they buy back more of them, then more people will have cash from the sale, which increases the supply of money. If they sell more bonds, then there will be less money in the economy.\n\n4. Governments also have the ability to print money. This can directly impact the supply of money in the way you say. When Germany did it during the Great Depression, their money became worthless. When Zimbabwe did it, the same thing happened. If the government pockets the extra money or uses it to pay off debts, then printing money functions as a regressive tax. As a result, governments never use this method to impact the economy as part of sound economic policy. They only do it as a way to replace physical money that is destroyed through wear and tear. Also remember that only 2-8% of money is stored in physical currency. The rest of it is stored digitally. \n\n**So, you are absolutely right about that fourth method. It is a regressive tax, and a terrible idea. But that doesn't mean that controlled inflation overall isn't a sound economic policy.**Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author ___OccamsChainsaw___'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Their payments never stop.  They can't save for retirement or afford to send kids to college. All that money they spend on shelter just evaporates (goes to the landlord). With rent abolished, they start making mortgage payments, and after 15years, they stop paying. Now they can save and send their kids to college and help their kids buy homes. Their children have children and sell the original family home, allowing the grandparents to pass on the value they invested to their grandkids, so the grandkids can buy homes and send *their* kids to college. \n\nNow imagine everyone doing this. No one gets obscenely wealthy and no one is able to draw merely passive income, but everyone has a home and land within their family.

I'll get a basic income too.\"\n\n\n*****\n\n#**Minarchist Libertarian Government**\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, I will give the Wikipedia definition:\n\n*\"Minarchism (also known as minimal statism) is a political philosophy. It is variously defined by sources. In the strictest sense, it holds that states ought to exist (as opposed to anarchy), that their only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from aggression, theft, breach of contract, and fraud, and that the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military, police, and courts. In the broadest sense, it also includes fire departments, prisons, the executive, and legislatures as legitimate government functions. Such states are generally called 'night-watchman' states.*\n\n*Minarchists argue that the state has no authority to use its monopoly of force to interfere with free transactions between people, and see the state's sole responsibility as ensuring that contracts between private individuals and property are protected, through a system of law courts and enforcement. Minarchists generally believe a laissez-faire approach to the economy is most likely to lead to economic prosperity.\"*\n\nThis would mean that some bare minimum of appropriate taxes would still need to be collected to fund the minimum level of government necessary to ensure the above mentioned services, along with a Basic Income. (I consider this a \"necessary evil\".) This also means that the courts would no longer enforce or hold legitimate any Rental agreements (just as one could not sell themselves into \"voluntary slavery\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*****\n\nI know this is a *HUGE* post with a lot of assertions, but I hope to get some great responses based on the voluminous fodder for discussion.

For example: 'That's so gay' and 'You throw like a girl' type insults. Many people come to the conclusion that these type of insults are homophobic and misogynistic, but I don't believe that's necessarily the case at all.\n\nI think the most insulting thing about being called a girl for a boy is the affront to his own identity. He is being called something he is not. He doesn't think its insulting because he hates girls and thinks they're inferior, but rather because his identity as a boy is being taken away.\n\nWomen in general also hate being associated with masculinity. They tend to want to be smaller than their partners because they feel masculine if they are taller. They religiously pluck facial hair and shave away body hair because that's manly. But they probably don't hate men.\n\nSimilarly, being called gay is a huge insult to many guys not because they are all homophobic, but because they are being called something they are not.\n\nI think the best way to see it from my point of view is looking at how offensive it is for trans people when they are mis-gendered (Purposely). It is a deliberate refusal of their identity. No one says a trans woman is a misandrist if she hates being referred to as 'he'. The people calling them 'he' are also unlikely to hate men, but say it to hurt the trans person. \n\nSo CMV, insults such as those above aren't necessarily homophobic or misogynist. They sting because they are an affront to identity more so than because being gay or a woman is a bad thing.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: blackflag415\n\nResponse A: Calling someone gay is homophobic because you are associating them with the stereotypical traits of gay people - effeminate, etc.   It has nothing to do with being called something you are not.  \n\nFor example, I am Jewish.  Yet I would still be offended if someone said 'You're cheap like a Jew' or 'You Jew'ed down the price.'

Replace gay with another mistaken identity (Swedish, vegetarian, libertarian,  etc.) and it doesn't carry the same negative connotation.

People don't like hearing that they didn't earn or deserve everything they have, or that free will and individual grit sometimes isn't enough, especially from some uppity Jesse Jackson types that didn't get the memo that Jim Crow is over. Well, that's how it comes across to Conservatives, anyways. Nobody wants to acknowledge that they might be the problem, so they villainize the messenger and reinforce their own prejudices. Case in point: #GamerGate. \n\nAll I'm saying is, maybe academics need a better approach. Not everybody sees life from a communitarian nurturing mother POV - especially in the United States. For example, there's a very good argument to be made that racism was not the primary cause of Michael Brown's death. Instead, it was his violent behavior in an altercation with a cop that caused the cop to retaliate with lethal force. Sure, race was no doubt a proximate cause and was probably a very distant cause for his circumstances, but his death was entirely avoidable if he didn't get so violent with the cop. Again, it all comes down to free will vs. determinism in issues like this. Sociologists and progressive types usually fall into the latter camp.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: cyberpunking\n\nResponse A: Firstly: I'd be interested in hearing how it is you would suggest \"marketing\" this problem that you admit exists.\n\nSecondly: \n\nPerhaps this is your experience, however there are many people who do deny this very fact. I have even met liberal open minded types who deny this because they have never experienced it first hand. It is a very hard thing to understand if you have had little interaction with minorities. \n\nI agree that many of these concepts such as \"white privilege\" and \"cultural appropriation\" have been exaggerated and blown out to the point where they are repulsive, inflammatory, and unrealistic. However, this is really the tumblrina/SJW version that you encounter on the internet or on posters and stickers at your community college. \n\nHaving an educated milder discussion about the concept of white privilege may not sit well or be easily recieved by conservative waspy types, but it is necessary to introduce a person to an idea before they can recognize it. Most white people I know have a story about that one time they were with their mexican/black/native friends and a topic came up in conversation so casually and shocked the white person by how matter of factly these people deal with some small act of discrimination regularly. It does take more than a conversation to make a person realize another person's situation, but it is a starting point.\n\nResponse B Author: SteamandDream\n\nResponse B: True. But its not about the people who arent on board; they'll die eventually; it's about the people who are developing views such as children and young adults.  \n\nWith each passing generation you can erode racism, sexism, etc and make people aware of the existence of these things and how to identify them simply by exposing young people to the concepts.  Ive seen this first hand growing up in the south where, in a conversation with one of my friends conservative white father, he called his daughter's boyfriend the n word; he at least cares enough for her not to do it in front of them, but the point is that despite his best efforts he was unable to pass that view onto his daughter evidenced by the fact that she was dating (and having sex with) a black guy.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author cyberpunking's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

We're convinced things will be better if we only spend time with other people who already like the same things we do.  Read the same books, watch the same TV, listen to the same music, display the same politics, and so on and so forth.\n\nI think this is at the core of the breakdown oh human co-operation.  All over the world, ideological differences are driving a wider and wider divide between people.  For the first time since the Pilgrims left for the New World, we have millions seeking an \"escape.\"  A common theme I hear from people in my generation and younger is \"I just want to buy a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere **and live my life the way I want to.**\"  To bolster this, over 200,000 people signed up for Mars One, a project that might not even be a reality, but it shows just how many people are ready and willing to bail on the human race on planet earth, just as the Puritans were ready to bail on Catholicism.\n\nThere is nothing necessarily wrong with getting along with people who have the same interests as you, and it is not as though I haven't seen the positive aspects of this in my lifetime.  Yes, the gay community was able to use the internet to facilitate finding each other more easily and thus were able to gain more traction and make their minority voice heard.  However, if the recent fight between transgender people and the gay community over the word \"tranny\" says anything, its that even when you're a minority, you're just as willing to absolutely reject people who are different than you and not worry about how your actions hurt them.\n\nMy point simply being:  I see the positives the internet has brought us.  I love the internet.  However, I'm not willing to sit here and watch humanity flush itself down the toilet because absolutely *nobody* is willing to have a rational conversation with people with different views.  (Barring except, of course, this small subreddit, which is very much a niche online.  We barely have enough people here to fill a small city.  We're in the glaring minority.)\n\nIn the US, the political discourse is falling into complete disarray as more new ideologies (Tea Party) spring up, and they have *zero intention* of having intelligent discourse.  They have every intention to attempt to destroy the status quo and replace it with their vision.  ISIS in Iraq is just as guilty of this, as well.  The internet facilitates this by partnering us with people who already have the same ideas as we do already.\n\nI struggle with this as a liberal who thinks I can't reject conservative thinkers because I see great points and philosophy on both sides of the aisle.  I feel like people on both sides of the fence are willing to reject evidence against their cause simply because they don't like it.  Then they talk amongst themselves to bolster more support.  They start downvote/upvote brigades.  I don't know a single political philosophy that isn't guilty of this, shoving their opinion down people's throats instead of having a nuanced, thoughtful discussion which is willing to take critique of their views.  (Seriously, I may be a liberal, but god damn are liberals *just as bad as conservatives.*  Don't let anyone tell you different.  It's bullshit and they know it.)\n\nI know the internet has brought us so many positive things in the modern world, but it has taught us to seek out people to be involved with in our lives based on criteria that we dictate.  A few decades ago, we would have to learn **good social skills to be able to connect with people who weren't exactly like us.**  Does that mean we had to agree with them on every issue?  No.  Does that mean there weren't still people who were total assholes?  No.  What it does mean, though, is that we have severely limited ourselves and our social ability to communicate effectively with people we might not agree with on every issue.  I think this is part of the cause of why we've seen the rise of extremism of every stripe and why people simply don't get along and just want to \"move to the country and be left alone.\"\n\nTL;DR: \"Knowing your audience\" or being able to communicate effectively with people who have different ideals is a **learned social skill.** Through applications that let us find people who already agree with us, we are teaching the opposite of that social skill.\n\nChange my view.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: why is putting up with people who have terrible opinions a good thing? if someone is against something as cut and dry as gay marriage i don't think listening to them ramble about the sanctity of marriage or family values is going to enrich my life in any way.\n\nthe reason being able to interact with those who have terrible opinions was seen as a good thing is because before the internet became widespread if you wanted to make friends you had to make do with the set of people who may or may not be morons that you encounter in every day life. this is no longer necessary and i don't see why it's a bad thing.\n\nResponse B Author: MrJebbers\n\nResponse B: I think that one of the things that the Internet is allowing people to do is to see that there are so many different people with different viewpoints.

Give it some time for the people who are growing up now, who are being exposed to the internet since birth, to grow up and see if they become more or less tolerant as a whole; as a society we already are vastly more accepting and tolerant than we were 30 or 40 years ago and I think that trend will continue.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author [deleted]'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: Reasons why Bitcoins will never be a widespread consumer currency that rivals traditional money:\n\n1. **Institutional Theft**: Hackers have [already stolen](http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks-and-breaches/bitcoin-thefts-surge-ddos-hackers-take-millions/d/d-id/1112831) millions of dollars worth of bitcoins from large/institutional holders of bitcoins. \"Joe Consumer\" can't adequately protect his money from this kind of targeted hacking. Right now banks and other financial institutions are charged with protecting traditional money. A bitcoin bank could possibly offer some protection (although no FDIC insurance) but it would erode some of the original stated purpose of bitcoins.\n2. **Fraud**: Similar to hacking if someone gains access to your online wallet and spends your bitcoins on goods and services and disappears you have no reliable way to recover the funds. With a consumer credit card you are not liable for ANY fraudulent transactions. \n3. **Chargebacks**: Let's say a merchant screws you. You buy a TV online, but instead you get a toaster, or worse you never receive the good. You have ZERO recourse without getting lawyers involved. Most people can't afford a lawyer to settle a consumer dispute. The great thing about credit card charge backs is that they allow you to dispute a transaction if you can prove the transaction did not ultimately occur as agreed and recover some or all of your money.\n\nResponse A Author: allthehobbies\n\nResponse A: \nI don't think there are any \"large/institutional holders of bitcoins\" in existence yet. The brokers and exchanges you are talking about are in the new growth phase and will of course have security issues in that stage. Many of them out there are complete scams. The good ones are still learning how to protect a completely new kind of currency. You don't offer any actual argument here against the technical capability of a legit bitcoin \"bank\" to protect it's bitcoin assets. Do you have any technical reasons why it would be impossible for a bitcoin bank to truly protect your bitcoin without referencing hacks of wild-west type bitcoin brokers and exchanges or fly-by-night scam operations?\n\nYour argument here sounds someone hundreds of years ago saying \"because someone can steal your gold and scam people out of their gold, gold will never be usable as a currency\"\n\n\nBitcoins are like cash, you are stating the obvious and then comparing it with a function of a credit card, which is not a currency. \n\nWhy can't you build a \"credit card\"-like system around Bitcoin? Credit cards are just an abstraction and logic layer built around other currencies (like the Dollar or the Euro)\n\n\nAgain, you are making a comparison of the function of a Credit Card to Bitcoin. My answer to number two applies here. To me, Credit Cards that allow chargeback are a lot like an escrow system. From my understanding, merchant services providers can build these kinds of systems around the bitcoin protocol.\n\nPersonally, I treat Bitcoin like cash. I'm only going to use it to buy something online from someone I trust, because as you said, there is no chargeback mechanism. As soon as a merchant services provider builds a system to allow that, or escrow like functionality, then I'll use my Bitcoin through that system to purchase items. \n\nIt is hard for you to argue that because there is a bunch of idiots out there getting scammed and being dumb with their Bitcoin, that it will never be wide adopted as a currency. When Credit Cards allowed online purchases, before chargebacks, many people got scammed online and lost their Dollars in the same way people are losing Bitcoins. Even worse, many dumb people used debit cards for online purchases and lost their money, but that doesn't reflect at all on the usefulness of the Dollar...\n\nBitcoin is not ready for Joe Consumer. We are in the stage where the services that allow that will be built. Consider that at this stage your judgement is way too early.\n\nResponse B Author: deathdonut\n\nResponse B: 1. Institutional Theft:  Bitcoins are actually harder to steal than physical currency.  Any thug with a knife can take your cash, but hacking into an account to steal bitcoins (something that can be done to physical currency too) is a much more specialized skill set.  If it becomes a serious risk, then the market for security will improve and tools/tracking/banking options will expand.  Insurance and reinsurance are options that should be as reliable as the FDIC, but those will only come about when people feel they are needed (much like the FDIC).\n\n2. Fraud &amp; Chargebacks:  Consumer credit cards are simply a service that provides abstraction of physical money.  The only thing that makes such a service difficult to implement for Bitcoin is that the convenient nature of the currency makes it harder for credit companies to justify their charges.  If people feel that their transactions are insecure, they will pay slightly more to do business with more reliable/established sellers.  If that's difficult to discern, there will be a market for a neutral entity to broker transactions with a delayed or mutually validated deal.  Without private businesses taking advantage of such markets with paper currency, there would be zero recourse for the average consumer without lawyers.  Consequently, someone figured out a way to get rich through offering such a service.  The same will happen here.\n\nUltimately, none of your concerns are unique to bitcoin.  The same concerns were voiced when checks, credit cards and even internet transactions started appearing.  As long as enough people have access to Bitcoins and interest in exchanging them, opportunists will solve the problems you listed.\n\nNow if you want to be concerned about more systematic problems, consider the technical issues involved with an infinitely splittable currency that tracks it's entire history on all split versions.  Maybe bitcoins can be corrupted by opposing financial institutions until they are costly to hold/transfer?\n\nWhat happens if people hoard bitcoins rather than spend them?  Are there traditional or non-traditional hurdles that are faced due to a lack of governing body?  I guess we'll see, but the 3 issues you list are not among my concerns.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author allthehobbies's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

With the weird exception of American Samoa, people in the four outlying territories have the ability to participate in all elections in the United States. These islands elect their own governors and legislators, and even compete in the presidential primaries. They cannot case votes in the Electoral College, because they are not states, BUT if any of these citizens lived in a US state, as American citizens, they could participate in presidential elections, meaning they are not discriminated against ethnically, but geographically.\n\nBut, that might not be a bad thing when you think about it. In order for these territories to vote, they would have to become states, due to the Electoral College. In Puerto Rico, the issue of statehood is deeply divisive and some desire it, while others want to maintain the status quo or full independence. There is no concensus and forcing statehood upon them doesn't seem very democratic. Also, consider the fact that the states are actually indivisible. According to the Supreme Court in Texas v White (1869), a state cannot unilaterally secede from the union. Imagine if when we colonized the Philippines, we decided to turn them into a state in order to protect our democratic values, despite the fact that the people there overwhelmingly did not want to be a state. Sure, now they can vote, but they're trapped in a union they don't want. This relates to the current situation, because these territories may not wish to remain part of the United States in the long run and in the meantime should be allowed to determine their own futures.\n\nThere are a lot of flaws in our democracy. This might be one of them. The Electoral College also seems like one; it resulted in four presidents who didn't receive a plurality of the popular vote. But then, so is the Senate. Why should California and Connecticut both have two senators. That gives people in smaller states waaayyyy more of a say than those in larger ones. There are only two states where prisoners can vote. We don't require Election Day to be a paid holiday. What about teenagers? Don't they have rights; why can't they vote? What about foreigners? If voting is an inherent human right can we really take it away from people just because of their age or nationality? Even the fact that we elect representatives in a republican manner instead of having direct Greek-like participation, theoretically makes our democracy weaker.\n\nMy point is that you could say similar things about any democracy in the world. In spite of all this, the United States, Canada, Western Europe and a few other countries are consistently ranked as the highest-quality democracies in the world, by any international standard. If your concept of a \"real democracy\" doesn't include the United States, either real democracies don't exist, or your standard is wrong. I would argue the latter. The US may not be perfect, but perfection is impossible. Every democracy has some reasonable restrictions on who is allowed to vote. Some of these should likely be reformed, but in the meantime, that doesn't make the state any less real of a democracy. There are undeniable measurable differences between the world's electoral democracies and its authoritarian states and it is inaccurate to state that the former do not exist.\n\nResponse B Author: tropical_chancer\n\nResponse B: Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands residents actually **do** have the right to vote, its just that their representative in Congress can't do roll call votes in Congress, nor do they have any electoral votes for President since its based on representation in Congress (more on that in a second). They have the full right to vote in local elections, and can freely vote in presidential elections if they have residency in a US state. So the issue with these territories is more about Congressional representation more than anything.\n\nThe problem arises though because Guam, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Marianas all have relatively low populations. Guam has the most with 160,000 people while the Marianas have only 53,000 people. In total the Pacific territories have a population of 270,000, half of the least populous state. The US Virgin Island's population is only 109,000. So giving these territories the usual 2 senators and 1 house member isn't justifiable given their populations are so much less than US states.\n\nPuerto Rico is unique among the US territories in that it has a much larger population. But the problem with Puerto Rico is that Puerto Ricans are divided on what, if anything should be done next. Some want statehood, some want a free association, some want to remain a commonwealth, and a few want total independence. There was a status referendum in 2012, but there were issues with the questions on the ballot. It left off choosing to remain a commonwealth as one of the choices. Past status referendums have always included remaining a commonwealth as a choice, and that has always been the most preferred choice. A third of ballots were left blank in protest for the wording of the questions. So even though there was a referendum in 2012, it's still not clear exactly what the majority of Puerto Ricans want in regards to their status. If a majority (or at least plurality) of Puerto Ricans are ok with the current situations, then what's the issue?Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Dudash's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: In the interest of full disclosure, I am Christian, although not your traditional one. That being said, this has nothing to do with my stance.\n\nMy reasoning is simple:\nThroughout the western world, the Bible and Christianity have been far and away the most significant influences in culture, literature, art, philosophy, law, etc. That being said, how can someone in the western world considered themselves educated without a basic familiarity and understanding of the Bible, its stories, and philosophy? It has nothing to do with teaching religion, but examining the bible as a piece of literature and philosophy. Such a class should be required of all students, as it is their responsibility as citizens that get in the voting booth to possess a rudimentary understanding of culture, philosophy, etc.\n\nShould other religious texts be taught, or atheism? Sure, but only as electives. For example the Koran, while increasingly relevant, has not had nearly as much influence as the Bible and is simply not as important to understanding the western world. Should I live in Saudi Arabia, the Koran should be mandatory and the Bible and elective. It's a simple matter deepening your understanding of the society you live in.\n\nWould this violate a separation of church and state? No, because it's not an endorsement of any religion. It's a simple acknowledgement of the text's importance in western society. The point is not to teach a religion as right or wrong, but to examine it the same you would examine any other religion from an anthropological, historical, and philosophical perspective.\n\n\nResponse A Author: pporkpiehat\n\nResponse A: First off: I am an atheist who teaches English at a college level, and I would actually say that one of the biggest difficulties that I have is contemporary students' general unfamiliarity with Christianity. The general Christian ethos comprises a huge part of the cultural context of most, let's say, pre-1900 literature. It's hard for irreligious students to understand how much subtext they're missing without this background. As such, particularly on a collegiate level, I think a general working knowledge of Christianity (including broad tenets of Thomism and general church history) are essential understanding a lot of Western literature.\n\n*On the other hand*, I'm not sure that high school is the best place for this, particularly the reading of the Bible in its entirety. I went to an extremely good high school, and I don't think we read any single text (aside, maybe for text books) as long or as involved as the Bible in its entirety would be. It's a long freakin' book, and there's got to be more useful things to expose a student to than the entirety of \"Deuteronomy\" and \"Numbers.\"\n\nLikewise, if one were to give that much attention to the Bible, I don't think you could justify not offering a comparable examination of other basic holy texts (the Koran, the Bhagavad Gita, etc.). Christianity has played a tremendously important role in Western history, but understanding cultural history should not always be about re-inforcing the dominant cultural forces.\n\nLastly, I'd argue that, though the Bible has long been the most important book, that it's influence at present has waned. One could make a legitimate case for Darwin's *The Origin of Species*, because of its profound influence on contemporary biological sciences, or some combination of Smith's *Wealth of Nations* / Marx's *Kapital* being more influential on today's society. They might also have more explanatory power than does the Bible. And in fact, I think that most high schools should and often do touch on basic tenets of biology or capitalism, though without necessarily teaching those originary texts themselves.\n\nResponse B Author: AramilTheElf\n\nResponse B: Far more than anything else here, I think that you're underestimating the scope of a high school class. When you take a history related class in high school, it's generally either \"World History\" or \"History of [Insert name of native country here]\". They teach the entirety of the history of the world in one class. It would be simply erroneous to argue that the Bible had more influence than the entirety of all events in the history of the world, because it didn't. High school classes don't go that specific into various events and influences. The entirety of the history of the world is one, maybe two years, and you want to spend a year on **the Bible**, which, while an influential work, is not nearly the same scope as the entirety of world history.\n\nI think even having it as an elective would be pushing it. I wouldn't mind it, because it's an elective and schools can choose what they want, but I think that a \"Religion\" class would be far more in the scope of a high school class, because it's far more broad. High school classes simply never go that specifically into a single work of literature, because the goal is not to create experts but give a working knowledge of the subject matter. A year, or even a half year, spent on the Bible is far more than a working knowledge, and compared to the time given to other areas of study, that's far, far more than other more important things. The Bible, while in influential, simply doesn't compare to the scope and purpose of a high school class.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author pporkpiehat's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

It is difficult for me to view these devices as anything but a distraction. Sure, there are a few occasions throughout the semester where having access to computers is helpful, and I do use slideshows, the internet, and the projector nearly every class. We watch movies and YouTube clips and play around with Rap Genius. But most of the time, for the courses and subjects that I teach, I cannot think of any real reasons why the average student would require access to his or her phone or laptop everyday in class, especially for things such as note-taking or calendar apps. \n\nYes, there are exceptions. Students with learning disabilities, for instance, might require specific technology, and students should have their phones with them in the event of an emergency. I know there are inventive curricula being implemented by professors who are incorporating technology in meaningful ways, but I find it hard to imagine how the majority of these techniques would improve the in-class teaching of literature and writing. \n\nOf course, the real problem for me is that it is impossible to monitor what students are actually doing on their laptops during class. A student may insist she needs her laptop or tablet to take notes, but how in the world can I stop her from surfing the web and distracting not only herself but the rest of the class?\n\nIn the last two years, I have found that students are becoming increasingly defensive and stubborn when it comes to this issue. This semester I am teaching adult learners for the first time in ten years, and they are even more rigid and inflexible than college freshmen, even though my syllabus clearly states my policies and I went over my issues with phones and laptops in the first class. \n\nThe last thing I want to do is waste class time policing my students or calling them out for being on their phones. I would rather just be cool with students using their devices. I think back to when I was in college and how I would draw in my notebooks during lectures, a habit that was not a distraction for me but in fact helped me to listen better to the professor. But doodling in notebooks or passing notes seems way different than scrolling through Facebook and Tumblr. Is it too much to ask students to spend two hours away from their precious screens? CMV\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: As a college student who has had professors who both encourage the use of electronics (laptops, tablets, etc.) to help with learning and discouraged/not allowed their use in class, let me try to explain to you from a student's prospective why some of us use these electronics in class. Keep in mind that I'm a political science student, so the majority of my notes are based on lectures from professors and aren't necessarily mathematical equations like you would see in math/science/engineering classes.\n\nFirst of all, I find it much easier to take better notes on a laptop. It's easier for me to organize my notes in a word document that allows me to copy/paste things, move notes around to organize them, etc. Also, when it comes time to study from my notes, it's much easier for me to find what I need to study when I can put all of my notes into one document and search for specific terms that I need to know. When I use written notes I can't just type in the word I'm looking for; I have to look through all of my notes for the specific things that I need to know which takes longer and inhibits my ability to efficiently study.\n\nYou said that you use slideshows, the internet, videos, etc. in class. If you post these things online before your classes start, it allows students to preview the material before coming to class, or look at this material on their own device while listening to your lecture/discussion. It makes it easier for students to engage in these things when they have it right there in front of them. Students can look at slideshows on their computers/tablets and then take notes right next to them on their computers so their notes match up with the correct slides (some students will print out slide prior to class and write notes next to them as well).\n\nIn terms of you teaching literature specifically, students could use their laptops/tablets as e-books, so they don't necessarily have to buy physical copies of the books that you use in class. If you have short readings that you use for your class you could distribute them electronically (through email or if your school/class has a webpage like Blackboard).\n\n\nThis is true, but even if they aren't on a laptop/tablet, it's impossible for you to truly monitor whether or not your students are truly paying attention or taking notes. If they're not using a laptop, they could still be doodling in their notebooks instead of taking notes, or simply zoning out and not paying attention.\n\nBasically, when used correctly, laptops/tablets can be a very useful educational tool. Students want to use them because they can be very helpful in their educational experience. The other thing you have to remember about teaching in college is that college students are supposed to be more independent in their studies than in grade school, meaning that if they want to use their laptops/tablets and distract themselves by going on the internet instead of listening during class then they will ultimately face the consequences with a worse grade.\n\nAlso, you might have noticed that I excluded the use of cellphones in this because in my experience students don't necessarily use cellphones for educational purposes in class but rather to distract themselves (even though they can be used for almost anything a tablet can be used for).\n\nResponse B Author: CorporateHobbyist\n\nResponse B: Student here. For reference, Our school adopted a mandatory IPAD policy. I hate it, but for different reasons. Cutting to the chase, I bring my nexus 7 to school to take notes and none of my teachers seem to care. \n\nBack on topic: This program made it easier to do thing for both the teacher and the student. The teacher can open up something to read in class, and all the students can view it immediately on their tablet. This saves time handing paper out, and saves paper itself. For example, in our biology class we can get the lab instructions and view the video together so we won't waste the teacher's time when she explains it. In my math class, it moves so fast that the teacher posts a million instructional videos and assigns us a lot of work. We can spend class time either learning the concepts or doing the work if you understand the concepts already (ex. \"Why would I need to go through definite integrals? I know this already. next video\")\n\nAlong with this, it made it easier on the students. At least most of my friends type VERY fast and have horrible handwriting. my freshman year (last year) I couldn't keep up with the professor. Now, I can type it all out and actually take in what (s)he is saying without focusing on getting it all down. I can also take pictures of diagrams (s)he drew on the board. \n\nFrom an English persepective, reading books is much easier. If we go with Nathaniel Hawthorne's books, for example, he loved using hard vocabulary. the e-book allows you to highlight the word and instantly find a definition, pronunciation, synonyms, and antonyms. The 1-2 minute process of looking through a dictionary now takes 1/2 a second. I'll be taking literature and composition next year or the year after that (albeit the college board's \"AP\" edition), and from what I've heard from friends, it reacquires alot of writing and taking notes while you read. Rather than have a book filled with a million doodles and post-it notes, why not have a clearly annotated e-book copy with pins on specific pages and a directory that points out where each pin was placed with a note on why it's there?\n\nAnother thing about paper is that you can/will lose it easier than a file on a laptop. Provided you don't lose your laptop (which can be backed up on countless services) students can't have an excuse for \"forgetting their homework\" when you ask them to email it to you.\n\nOn distractions: Fair point. As a student, I do sometimes get distracted.However, that hurts me. Since you teach a college course, you know that students don't even need to show up. They come to the class to learn, and come to the college to learn. goofing off on their laptop just makes it harder for them to succeed. \n\nI get your concerns, but the benefits of using electronic devices in this day and age far outweighs the negative effects.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author [deleted]'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I don't know how much server capacity you can get for almost a million dollars a year, but it certainly wouldn't hurt. I think maintaining the reddit experience should come before donating large sums to charity, especially when the experience has been deteriorating recently. CMV.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: allthefoxes\n\nResponse A: The true issue is that the problem reddit servers are having is not solved by money. Getting more servers would just make the errors more likely.\n\nThe issue is an infrastructure one. Reddit needs to clean up their code, change their systems, and work on creating a more stable server environment. \n\nThe issue you are getting with the 503s is an issue with [Memcached](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached), a system reddit uses. Basically, Reddit has so many things to keep track of, that their memcache servers are having issues passing off data to their app servers.\n\nThis problem is a scalability one, and an infrastructure one, not a \"not enough servers\" problem.\n\nMoney doesn't solve this, hard work by developers do. Reddit needs to rewrite its code and how it handles its memcache at a very low level. This simply takes time.\n\n---\n\nWhile this is a pretty known issue, I should probably source myself with something official anyways, since you can't just take my word for it, so here you go!\n\nFrom reddit admin and engineer /u/spladug:\n\n\n\n\n\n[Source!](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/covw0us)\n\n---\n\nAnother:\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/covsmyd\n\n---\n\nReddit uses AWS, Amazon Web Services.

In order to improve the site's stability a lot of code needs to be rewritten which is a harder problem to solve with money. \n\nYes you can hire more developers, but based on the lessons in [the mythical man-month](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) \"adding more labor to a late project makes it later.\" In other words, the time cost of hiring developers, training them (especially if current developers have to do some of the training), and getting them familiar enough with the code base that they can do the work that needs to be done makes it so that hiring a new developer can actually slow the project down. It's a surprisingly difficult problem to solve just by throwing money at it.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author allthefoxes's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

When you refer to a large of people entirely based on their race and they themselves do as well, it may not seem wrong. Particularly when they are given equal opportunities and equal rights as the rest of the population. However, I argue that since their identity has been linked to their race nonetheless, it in fact encourages an image of separation. When you introduce yourself, you don't say \"I'm a Caucasian-American.\" Yet it is normal for other races to introduce themselves as \"I'm African-American\" or \"I'm Asian-American\" when we should all be saying \"I'm American.\" Because then if all races are indistinguishable from each other and are known by their nationality, then no subtle separation of identity happens and we can say we have realised equality on a small, social scale as well as the large, fundamental scale that we've achieved in recent decades.\n\nWhen I talk to a \"minority\", I don't identify the colour of their skin as an important thing to take notice of when I later explain him or her to a friend. They're just a man or a woman. It's not complete social equality if you're referring to someone and including their race in the explanation, or they introduce themselves using their race as part of their identity when not all races engage in this.\n\nA relevant clip from a 60 Minutes interview with Morgan Freeman may explain what I'm talking about more clearly:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh8mUia75k8\n\n\nI originally started this thread because I'm not really wholly \"British\" in regards to ethnicity - I'm mixed race. Half of my family originate from Armenia in blood ([which means I'm half Indo-European Aryan if the official Armenia website is to be trusted] (http://www.tacentral.com/people.asp?story_no=2)) and my other half are British by blood as well (Welsh, to be specific). However, the Aryan ethnic features are not white, blonde people with blue eyes as it's thought of, due to Nazism. I've been to Armenia, it's not the case. \n\nIn recent weeks, I questioned how I should be identifying myself. Am I \"Armenian-British\"? Am I really \"Aryan-British\"? Should I identify myself as just \"Armenian\" or \"British\"? Or \"Aryan\"? Or \"Half Armenian, half British\"? Which side of my family is more relevant in determining how I see myself?\n\nThen I began asking myself how I would be perceived if I identified myself using any of the labels except \"British\". Would I be seen as a foreigner? Would it still be equal for me to publicly identify myself something other than my nationality or mixing that with my designated race when someone describes me? If that were the case, would people subtly view or judge me differently for it or think nothing of it? Does it depend on the person who learns this? Of course, I don't hold these views now.\n\nThese questions I had are what led to me to take the view that it wasn't still equal in that case - but I keep an open mind. So I asked you - and you definitely delivered in the \"(literal) boatloads\".\n\nTo those whom express a legal concern at my former proposal, you are right. For such a thing to done, thoughts and perceptions would need to be regulated, and Orwell would be livid. When I wrote this question, I intended to pose it in a theoretical light because it was only my view. I make sure I never consider my opinion as fact or a part of me. Particularly when I'm uncertain, similar to when I asked myself all those questions. Make you define your opinions, never make your opinions define you. To quote Tzu: \"Watch your words; they become actions.\" I recommend everyone reads [u/essentialsalts] (http://www.reddit.com/user/essentialsalts)'s comment for a legal perspective on this proposal.\n\nTo those who commented and were of different races, you provided a very relevant perspective on this proposal, and I thank you for providing your arguments and insight. It was invaluable in helping me CMV.\n\nThis is an informative and extraordinary discussion on the relationship between race, identity, nationality and how that influences perception within an ever increasingly tolerant society. Thank you for giving your opinions and analyses on this. It was all a joy to read. Thank you for changing my view.\n\n\nResponse A Author: Mavericgamer\n\nResponse A: There are a few practical problems and one theoretical problem with your proposal. Let's start with the purpose of labels. Let's say that I have a stack of DVDs. One is a movie, one has a bunch of file folders, one is an XBox disc, one is just the most hardcore porn you could imagine, etc. Now, if I've labeled them all (or they all come with labels), then I can distinguish the content at a glance. Despite all the data being different, they are descriptively identical if I just say \"get me that DVD\" and point to the stack, or if they aren't labeled they won't know which DVD is which if I ask for *Night at the Roxbury*. Without knowing how I've stacked them, I might get the *Night at the Roxbury* or I might get *Hardcore Anal Whores 13: Return of Edward Dildohands*. \n\nSimilarly, someone's nationality isn't readily apparent, so if someone asks me \"What does James look like?\" it isn't as relevant information if I say \"He's American, about 6 feet tall, big hands\" compared to \"He's Asian-American, about 6 feet tall\" etc.\n\nMore importantly though, the idea won't have the effect you want. Let's imagine, for a moment, that you grew up in a time that didn't have a word for anything related to the male genitalia. Now, if a guy slaps you with his dick, you don't have the word to describe what just happened, *but that doesn't make your face any less dick-slapped.* For a more real life example, after a senator in Arizona got shot, there were people who were saying that we should remove \"violent words\" from school curriculum, the media, and the English language. At a glance, it is obvious why this is absurd: just because I don't have the word to describe a punch doesn't mean that I am physically incapable of balling my hand into a fist and swinging it at someone's face. Hell, most of my elementary school bullies were proof of that.\n\nThere is a difference between noting that there are differences between people, and discrimination. My friend Kevin is black. That is a thing he is, that is a fact of the world, just like my friend Brian is white, and my friend Crystal is of Asian descent. Discrimination and inequality comes in when somebody think that they are less worthy of personhood because of those facts, and that is a dying idea, by and large.\n\nResponse B Author: humanmanguy\n\nResponse B: I think that people who are African-American or Asian-American don't identify themselves strictly as such. The African/Asian part is there to indicate their race, not to indicate their place in society. It isn't a title people use in place of nationality, it is something used to indicate race when necessary. \n\nFor example, if a black American travels to another country, and someone asks him what his nationality is, he would most likely answer \"American\" rather than \"African American\".\n\n\nIf that same black American were to go into a (US) hospital for a check up, and the sign in form asked him what race he was, he'd either write \"African American\" or \"Black\" because they're two words that describe the same thing. The reason people in the US say \"African American\" rather than \"Black Guy\" is because the latter is seen as politically incorrect. Some black people could take offense at being called black, similarly to how an Asian may take offense to being called yellow. \"African American\", however, is universally accepted as being the politically correct way to refer to someone of that race (as well as Asian American).\n\n\nAnother thing is that your idea of equality appears to involve ignoring the existence of any race at all. This may seem logical, but it isn't right. Many people attribute their cultures, beliefs, morals, etc directly to their races. Ignoring the fact that there are different races is like ignoring the cultures of those people. \n\n\nI'm a Hispanic American. Although technically I am Caucasian, on legal documents I always put down that I am Hispanic given the option. Not because I don't think I'm Caucasian, but because I *identify* with being Hispanic, and I want my government to acknowledge that.\n\n\nIt isn't about skin color or race, it is about identity. We are all proud to be Americans, but we also haven't forgotten about out roots, be them Africa, Cuba, or anywhere else in the world.\n\n\nJust because we want to be treated the same, doesn't mean we want to all be the same.

Federal minimum wage in the United States is currently $7.75/hr (I think).  But that certainly shouldn't be the lifetime wage of someone who \"works hard all their life\".  If you're making minumum wage when you're 30-35, that's a problem with *you*, not a problem with the employer.\n\nSo let's assume a typical \"low wage\" worker averages $10/hour throughout their lifetime (for [reference](http://ycharts.com/indicators/average_hourly_earnings), the current average hourly wage in the US is over $24.00).  On a 40 hour work week, that's $20,800/year or $1,733/month.  Can a person retire on that income at age 62?  I think the answer is yes.\n\nThe stock market has historically averaged an 8% return over the long term.  At that rate, if you can put in just $54/month (about 3% of your paycheck) for 44 years (from the time you're 18 until 62), you'll have around $262,000 when you turn 62.  And if you continue to earn 8% on that, you'll be earning $1,737/month in income - which replaces that $1,733 monthly income that you previously had from working.\n\nSo then the only question is whether or not people can live on $1,679/month ($1,733 in wages less $54 going to savings).  Obviously, different regions have different costs of living, but it is certainly possible to live in the United States on $1,679/month.  If you disagree with that, it is another discussion.\n\nWhen it comes to being able to retire at 62, **the problem isn't that workers aren't getting paid enough, it is that they have other priorities that are more important to them throughout their working years** and don't make saving for retirement a priority.  They don't save that $54.00/month.  They spend it on Starbucks and beer and cigarettes and cell phones and cable TV.  They spend too much on cars, clothes and housing when a less expensive alternative would let them save that $54.00.  They go gambling or take a vacation or rent a Jet Ski for a day.  They do a lot, but they don't save that $54 every month.\n\nAnd that's fine.  I'm not judging those folks.  If they want beer or cigarettes, if they want nicer clothes, if the Jet Ski was a blast - that's fine!  They should enjoy their lives and enjoy the fruits of their labor the way they see fit.  But it is those choices that mean they *can't* retire when they are 62 - not the low wages paid by their employer.\n\n\nResponse B Author: hacksoncode\n\nResponse B: Ultimately, all the productivity of a country comes from the productive activities of the people that work for a living. Any income that retired people have can only, ultimately, come from the people that are still working.\n\nHow many workers do you need to support 1 retiree? Well, let's say that every worker pitches in 10% of their income, and that retirees can live on half of what a worker can live on due to owning a home, having fewer expenses, etc., etc.\n\nThat would mean that you need 5 workers for every retiree, or the system simply can't support itself. \n\nThe consequence of that, though, is that the life expectancy of someone at retirement can't possibly go much higher than 1/5 of one's working life. If you start work after college, and work until you're 62, that's 41 years. \n\nThis means that your scheme can only possibly work, mathematically if people's life expectancy at age 62 is no more than 70.2 years, unless the working people are paying significantly more. If we take 20% of everyone's earnings, we could deal with life expectancy being 78.3 (which is about where it is today).\n\nIs it worth that? Well, perhaps, but you're not going to get the free money fairies to pay for it. Social security taxes would have to increase at least 50% above what they are at today.

My problem is with people who claim to have some other gender that doesn't exist as a sex. Obviously not everybody is going to feel that they perfectly fit the stereotype for how \"males\" or \"females\" should behave. But, since these \"other\" or nonspecific gender identifications don't correlate to a sex that exists, it doesn't make sense to me that people should be inventing a classification for their gender.

CMV\n\nResponse A Author: andero\n\nResponse A: Isn't it possible, indeed more likely, that they are just having a difference experience than you?\n\nI am the first to concede that I do not understand the trans position at all. I do not get it. I was born a dude, raised a dude, and as a dude, I abide. But I do not *feel* like a dude. It would not disrupt my experience of reality if someone started referring to me as a lady. It would not bother me if someone started talking as if I did not have any gender at all, referring to me as \"it\" or whatever. I would just roll with it. I am what I am. So what is the big deal? There is none. For me.\n\nFor other people, they seem to hold their gender identity very close to their self-concept. If a person puts a great deal of stock in being male it disrupts their experience when someone refers to them as a female. And it is easily more general than that: if someone identifies as young and someone refers to them as old, or Russian and someone refers to them as \"white\", or they identify as a software engineer and someone refers to them as a computer engineer. These are all ways of imposing a false identity upon a person that is jarring for them to hear because they view themselves a certain way.\n\nSo, try not to think about it as \"simply want attention\". Sure, they want to be regarded a certain way, but that is true of nearly everyone. So it is just that they want to be regarded in a certain way that is counter to what is visually apparent to others. Fair enough. Abide. Does it matter to you what pronoun you use for them? Who do you think it impacts more, them or you?\n\nResponse B Author: MrCapitalismWildRide\n\nResponse B: Gender is a social construct. It's defined by a number of things, but one of the most important ones, and one not often discussed, is about how you relate to society. Many cultures have other genders, third gender, two-spirit, hijra, etc. that are considered to be outside the gender binary, but are also considered to be defined by the experience unique to that culture.\n\nWe have gender roles, we have gender expression, we have physical characteristics, in other words, we have a ton of external gender markers, but ultimately those markers don't matter. A drag queen does a great deal to look as close to a woman as possible, but still identifies as male, despite overhauling their physical appearance, at least temporarily. On the other hand, a trans woman is still a woman even if they haven't been able to transition for whatever reason, and physically appear to be still male.\n\nThe explanation of gender dysphoria does more to explain things, but it still doesn't tie gender directly to assigned sex. After all, people don't only experience genital dysphoria. A trans person may experience dysphoria as a result of being called the wrong pronouns.

The following isn't exactly how I feel, and it's certainly only one side of the story, but I think it's a valid argument in the \"against\" column re: legalizing drugs.\n\nSo, here's the thing:\n\n\nWhen you have an addiction, you're no longer a rational agent exercising free will. To a certain extent, you're not doing what you want to do, you're doing what the drugs want you to do: consume more drugs. It's cause and effect, a chemical reaction.\n\nDid someone make an original choice to start taking drugs? Maybe. But you can think of lots of examples where someone puts themselves into a bad situation, but government nevertheless steps in to save them from themselves. If someone is drunk driving and gets in an accident, the EMT's don't say \"well, I guess they wanted to crash, so we should respect their wishes and leave them there\". In a civilized society, we intervene to help get people out of a bad situation. Drug addiction is definitely a bad situation, and one from which people are often unable to get help, or even ask for help, on their own.\n\nResponse B Author: smashybashy\n\nResponse B: Krokodil, the drug going through Russia right now, puts you through a month of withdrawal pain that's strong enough to make you black out according to a Vice documentary on it.  The potential to abuse this is ridiculous, and legalizing it just makes it easier for people to do that.  If a seller tricks some idiot into doing it just once it really screws that person over, to the point where it could leave them dead or physically/mentally disabled.  I think that's just far far far too much power to put into the hands of the free market.  \n\nAlso, krokodil is one of the worse drugs out there, and it was pretty much invented by a bunch of druggies who couldn't afford heroin.

Such as siding with the right so they won't have to pay income taxes for things they won't specifically benefit from. \n\nBut when they say they'd like to cut entitlement programs they probably mean after they're done collecting *their* social security checks. And with their retirement funds not accounting for inflation it won't keep them at the standard of living they'd become accustomed to. They'll not only vote to keep entitlements going, I wouldn't be surprised if they demanded more. \n\nThe (increasingly) large percentage that won't have retirement to fall back on at all will likely need to live with one of their children, who may or may not be willing/able to support them. Sure they'll be able to live in retirement communities but they'll fill up fast, and will drop in quality because of the increased demand for resources. And with so many grown children being unable to pay for better options the boomers will have to turn to the government for assistance. \n\nThis generation will also be requiring more healthcare than ever in their lives. The boomers will *demand* lower prices, better quality, and will encourage as much regulation as possible. It'll probably be the thing that leads to universal healthcare.\n\nYes, in the end I believe even the boomers that will say they're republican will probably cast democratic votes to save face.

Now, this is very important because in his time John Locke was considered a radical liberal to suggest the concept of tabula rasa, equality and the rights of the people. The French began to adopt this idea and this resulted in many political conflicts to loyalist types who could never really put down the rebellion. My professor said this was because \"Once the toothpaste is out of the tube you can't put it back in\". What he means by this is that once a right exists and is widely accepted it cannot realistically be removed from the people who want it. He goes onto explain several historical examples including why there is only one \"negative amendment\" and why it itself was amended (referring to prohibition). The major point Im trying to make is that Liberals have been historically the ones to fight for individual and civil rights. Gun rights are a right that is incapable of being put back in the tube and I don't comprehend why this is the only \"right\" that doesn't seem to apply to liberal politics. \n\n\nResponse A Author: CalicoZack\n\nResponse A: A couple of points:\n\n1\\. To say that enlightenment philosophers invented the idea of a right to own arms is missing part of the picture. Centuries before that, people felt entitled, and even [legally obligated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assize_of_Arms_of_1181) to own military weapons of some kind. Then in the 17th century, when royals began to confiscate the weapons of regular citizenry, they felt as though they had been wronged somehow and made slaves to an oppressive king. It wasn't until the Enlightenment that this entitlement was couched in terms of a \"right\", but a similar sentiment existed before then. [Source, starting at page 5.](http://constitution.org/2ll/2ndschol/74malt.pdf)\n\n2\\. As others have noted, \"liberal\" is a confusing word that can refer to both ends of the political spectrum, depending on context. \n\nBut I'm not sure that this point fully addresses your view. You correctly noted that many \"individual and civil rights\" are associated with liberal politics (as in, left-liberal, not right-liberal). There seems to be a weird discrepancy between rights that are associated with the left versus the right. The right to bear arms and many Fourth Amendment rights (for example) are associated with \"classical liberalism,\" i.e. conservatism, while Equal Protection rights or a right to gay marriage would be strongly identified as left-leaning. What gives?\n\n3\\. [This article](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/04/a-thrivesurvive-theory-of-the-political-spectrum/) is the best attempt I've ever seen at providing a principled distinction that separates the \"right\" from the \"left.\" The argument is that the political spectrum is essentially a measure of how much energy a person devotes to defending against outside and opposing forces versus how much they devote to developing and expanding their own resources and happiness. To use a metaphor from the article, being conservative is like making choices that would promote survival in a zombie apocalypse, while being liberal is like making choices that would optimize a post-scarcity utopia.\n\nWhen you think of it this way, the problems in deciding what positions are liberal versus conservative seem to be much clearer. In times of relative peace, the conservative position is to promote gun rights for self-protection and to mount a defense against encroaching big government. But when a country is faced with an outside existential threat, the extreme far-right position is fascism, where citizen would be willing to throw away gun rights and other classically liberal rights in exchange for protection from a strong leader. In that case, the \"liberal\" (now left) position is to fight for gun rights, to protect an underprivileged minority from being stomped by an overreaching majority.\n\nAt present, there isn't a strong conservative narrative of an existential threat to most countries. In that case, gun rights tend toward conservative, because those are the people who feel the need to protect themselves from the rest of the world. By contrast \"liberals\" support taking away guns, because in their worldview we don't really need them, and they're just dangerous toys.\n\n\nResponse B Author: MontiBurns\n\nResponse B: Politics isn't on a pure left-right spectrum. There are lots of factors at play.  Low taxes are inherently liberal, since they maximize an individual's right to spend money as they wish.  However, they're generally championed by conservatives.  Nowadays, we have an idea of what leftists support, and what rightwingers support, and we label that issue *edit as either \"liberal\" or \"conservative\"*.  Perhaps pro gun views fall into conservative camp because of demographics.  Urban city dwellers probably have a more unfavorable view of guns (since they see lots of violent use of guns), urban city dwellers also tend to be mostly liberal.  Therefore liberals tend to be more anti gun.  Opposite for rural folk *edit who have more of a positive opinion and experience with guns*.\n\nSpecifically, the reason why leftists tend to favor gun control is they see it as a public safety issue.  \"More guns in more hands leads to more deaths, either accidental or on purpose.\" (more of an urban experience with guns)  Also, you'll find most mainstream liberals aren't for outright banning guns, but for stricter gun control laws (handguns and semi-automatics, magazine sizes, where you can carry them and what you need to carry them).  If we're following the constitution to the letter, you should be able to own any firearm or explosive, since they all count as \"arms\".  However, few people realistically support allowing private citizens owning hand grenades and rocket launchers, let alone nuclear weapons.\n\nIt comes down to a balancing act of individual rights vs. the greater good.   The amount of damage an individual can do with a nuclear weapon, for example, is much greater than the damage caused by taking away everyone's right to own nuclear weapons.  Where to draw the line comes into question.  Some people don't see owning a semi-automatic pistol with a 30 round magazine as justifable.  Others see it as an inherent right.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author CalicoZack's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

A \u2018terrorist\u2019 is a person who uses terrorism in the pursuit of political aims. But have you ever really questioned what it takes to be considered a terrorist? Like what do you have to do exactly to be labeled as one? Do you need to blow up buildings, kill innocent people, think a certain way, and be apart of a radical or religious group? Are you really immune as a U.S. citizen? How many innocent people are falsely labeled or punished? And who gets to decide? \n\nThe problem with the war on terror is there will never be an end. It is the perfect war. Perfect for growing the military industrial complex adding to the increase of mass surveillance, police militarization, drone strikes, and innocents being accused, imprisoned or killed. It is a true modern day witch-hunt. There will always be a \u2018terrorist\u2019 because terrorism is an ideology. But as the years go by the word is being more and more loosely defined. \n\nBy using the word terrorism to fight our enemies, it has completely sheepified the population. It simply is a lot easier to get your way as a politician if you use it. In reality there is no black and white. The truth is people have different interests; to them they are freedom fighters, and heroes fighting for their values. We are probably even considered a terrorist to our terrorists. It is clear the war on terror has failed and has led nowhere besides a never-ending cycle of fighting fire with fire or violence for violence. Lets take a new perspective. Lets start educating each other about our different viewpoints and cultures. Lets once and for all end the use of the words \u2018terrorism, and terrorist\u2019. Instead lets work towards a greater understanding of the world and each other. The end of the never-ending war starts with investment in education not the latest high tech weaponry.  \n\nResponse A Author: garnteller\n\nResponse A: You kind of dilute your argument at the end when you get into the \"success\" of the \"war on terror\", so let me focus on your title and the beginning of your post.\n\nHere's the Merriam Webster definition of terrorism:\n\": the use of violent acts to frighten the people in an area as a way of trying to achieve a political goal\"\n\nTo me, that's pretty clear.  9/11 was terrorism.  They didn't attack strategic targets, they tried to terrorize the US into meeting their demands.  The same is true of, say, the IRA bombings in London, the Boston Marathon bombing, and pretty much any suicide bomber who goes into civilian areas with the intent of killing as many people as possible.\n\n\nWell, yeah, you need to target non-strategic targets in a way to incite mayhem and fear to accomplish a political goal.  So, if you are just insane and think it's fun to kill people, you aren't a terrorist, just a murderer without a political agenda.  If you try to blow up a military base, you aren't a terrorist, you're a guerrilla fighter..  \n\n\nNo.  The Oklahoma City bombers were terrorists.  So was the Unabomber.\n\n\nThe pursuit of potential terrorists is a different question.  But most people decide that those who attempt to use violent acts to cause fear to achieve political goals are, by definition, terrorists.\n\n\nIt's shorthand for \"preventing terrorist acts\", and easier than saying, \"The war on Al Queda, Al Shabab, the KKK, Hamas, and every other group that wants to commit terrorist acts.\n\n\nYes, in the same way that \"the war on crime\" or \"the war on poverty\" will never be \"won\".  But just because you can't declare victory doesn't mean you shouldn't fight it.\n\n\nNo, a \"witch hunt\" implies that you're searching for imaginary enemies.  That's simply not true.  There are real live people out there who want to blow up Americans, the more the better.  There are Americans leaving to fight in the middle east who may come back and use what they've learned.  This isn't just some bogus red scare stuff, there are people who want you dead, simply for being an American.\n\nAnd Terrorism isn't an ideology, it's a tool.  But it's a tool that people are willing to use.\n\n\nDo you have any examples of this?\n\n\nI don't think that Osama bin Laden planned 9/11 because he felt he wasn't understood.  \n\nI agree in theory that we need to consider the consequences of our actions, and not make enemies needlessly, but we live in a dangerous world.  Dropping all our weapons and welcoming them with open arms would not end well.\n\nResponse B Author: ShadowyTroll\n\nResponse B: This argument seems to be mixing up two different points. One is good, one is not so good.\n\n1. We should stop *overusing* the word terrorist as a scare word and take a deeper look at political relations. I agree with this entirely. The amount of people who die from terrorist attacks outside specific unstable war-zones is pretty limited and it is a danger like any other but not one to give up your rights and cry over. Terrorism is also inherently political. If your country is suffering a lot of terrorist attacks it is indicative of terrible relations with another country or ethnic group.\n\n2. The second part seems to be an argument that terrorism isn't a real thing. The term is usually described as an indiscriminate attack on a population intending to cause fear and chaos for political gain. In that way they are different then lets say a rebel force who fights an enemy government. Someone who stages an attack and occupies an enemy military base is a rebel. Someone who bombs a bus full of children going to school is a terrorist. The difference here is not what side your on, it is your target. I'd also say that while someone like Anders Breivik, who killed for political reasons, is a terrorist, a kid who decides to go to school and start blowing peoples' heads off with a shotgun one morning is usually not a terrorist. They are a mass murderer and possibly have mental issues yes, but they are not furthering a strategic ideological goal. Just because people misuse the word doesn't mean it isn't useful.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author garnteller's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I disagree because she has full custody, and should have just left.\n\nOp:  I recently read this case on a legal website and decided to read the whole thing and it kind've irked me. The court may not have made the wrong decision per se, but Maybe the petitioner messed up by even going to the court for permission at all.\nhttp://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/AppellateCourt/2012/1stDistrict/1111916.pdf\n\nBasically, a divorced woman with \"full custody\" of her children wanted to move to a different state for financial and educational reasons.. Respecting the divorce decree that granted her ex-husband visitation rights with his kids, but no custody, she petitioned the court in Illinois,USA,where they lived ,to give her leave to relocate. She outlined a new visitation plan and told the court all the details of why she wanted to move and how it could be arranged to keep her kids in regular contact with their father and the Illinois side of their family. The petition was ultimately denied by the court and on an appeal because the father made claims that the move would obstruct his decreed visitation time, and give the woman too much control over the nature of the visitation with the kids.  If there was joint custody I would be more inclined to concur with the courts but in this case I cry foul ball. \n\n I'm not sure I disagree with the courts' decisions rationally because they weighed the circumstances pretty solidly, except maybe I don't see how there can be any objection to the woman, with full custody, retaining control over the nature of the visitation with her kids; nor do I understand how the fact that the father couldn't afford to keep up visitation in another state should become the mother's burden especially when she is willing to help fund the continued visitation; and finally also why they didn't factor in the reduced visitation sending the eldest child to a boarding institution might cause on all parties.The kids are all relatively advanced in age, and I am not an opponent of father's rights, but I do think the outcome was unfavorable in this case especially considering the situation with the house being already sold on the market. \n\nPersonally I think her actual mistake was asking the courts for permission and trying to work out an arrangement. Anytime you involve the courts and the party appears to object you reduce your chance of getting your way down to 50/50 who else sees it that way? Sometimes, especially with family matters, Its better to DO and apologize than to ask for permission and be denied.\nI'm sure there are lawyers and lawful-good persons who might  disagree and I want to hear from you so I can better understand the ramifications of my rationale(ie what I would have done.)\nWhich is to say if you have full custody of your children and you want to move to a different state in the U.S. just leave. The IL court would have no jurisdiction in NJ, and you have full custody so it couldn't be considered kidnapping. If he makes too much trouble I'm sure he'd have had to go to court in Jersey with his visitation order to demand visitation rights be respected(or get custody) but thats all he could do is ask them to grant him a similar order in NJ. Mission accomplished. He should get his money right so he can keep up with them, not be allowed to use the divorce decree to encumber the ex-wife's right to choose what U.S. state she wants to raise her kid's in. She also screwed up by selling her house before the petition was granted. \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: cpolito87\n\nResponse A: I'm a lawyer, but not a family law lawyer so take this with a grain of salt and your own research. I suggest looking up the UCCJEA and how it would apply. My understanding is that the IL court would actually maintain jurisdiction, even if she moved. The law was passed for the exact purpose of keeping parents from fleeing the jurisdiction of a court that rendered an unfavorable decision and seeking a conflicting custody decision elsewhere. It is the law in all 50 states. IL is the home state and would maintain jurisdiction, and if mom ran off she'd have to still come back to IL to fight it because the NJ courts would be obligated to honor any decisions of the IL court. \n\nResponse B Author: the-beast561\n\nResponse B: I'm confused.

An authoritarian ruler is not concerned with such troubles, only in the running of their country/life's pleasures.\n\n* A King/Queen is far more efficient than voting once in a while. You don't need to wait four years to get another shitty party in power, but just hold a few demonstrations/public campaigns to raise awareness of issues for your monarch to act on as they see fit, at any time, from the next day to perhaps years later.\n\n* The illusion of actually having any power will be gone, for really, it *is* an illusion. Your government doesn't actually care about individuals, their opinions, or their troubles. All they care about is votes. Once they have them, they will do whatever they wish, namely, keeping themselves in power. If you have an authoritarian ruler who has no competition, the will seek only to improve their own legacy and country. I'm talking about a monarch here, not dictator; someone who has been raised by leaders, to lead.\n\n\nResponse A Author: Eloquai\n\nResponse A: All of your points work on the assumption that the leader of your country is going to be (for want of a better phrase) a 'good person' responsive to the views and interests of their citizens. Sometimes that'll be the case, sometimes it won't be; in an absolute monarchy, there's no guarantee that a good king will follow a good king. At least in a democracy, you're not stuck with some guy ineptly ruling over you for fifty years and no means to challenge his authority.\n\nYour points seem to touch on a deeper issue: that democracy is inherently flawed. In that sense you're probably correct but that means we have to work on improving democracy rather than switching to a system that completes removes the already fragile political agency of citizens. \n\nIn this light, we can offer a non-authoritarian answer to each of your points. For point 1, we should make sure citizens are better educated about politics and government. For point 2, we should make sure our leaders are truly accountable to the general wishes of the people. For point 3, we should again make sure that governments do not possess absolute power in between elections.\n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: \nWhat about dictators who were raised by previous dictators? These are people who have been raised by leaders, so how would they differ from a king/queen? For example, Kim Jong Un was raised by leaders to lead, and is not the leader of North Korea. Since he has no competition, he has no incentive to make his country better, so the people of North Korea suffer.

I use a Windows 8 computer for work, and it also has a lot of things that launch at start, which makes its boot time take &gt;1 minute, so it's not just that Windows 8 is making your PC boot faster.\n\n\nNo you can't. Not in 8 standard anyway. The big reason that 8 was despised is that the Start button on the taskbar - aka the way most people accessed all of their programs - is no longer accessible at all. All you have is the start screen with the tiles. So yes, if you don't want to clutter your desktop, you're forced to interact with the tiles, and many people don't like that UI, and for good reason: they aren't using a tablet. That \"metro\" UI works wonderful on tablets, and I'm definitely picking up a Windows 8 tablet because I want a tablet where I know I can use most of my desktop apps (that aren't games). You touched on this (ha, I am punny) in your OP: the problem is that if you are *not* on a touchscreen, that UI is complete garbage to work with compared to a start menu, and a lot of people don't have touchscreens. I believe that more people will as time goes on.\n\nYou might not miss Windows 7 and back's start menu. That's fine for you, but a lot of computer work is based on habit and repetition. If I'm used to clicking on the start menu and going to my favorite list of programs, switching to Windows 8 means a lot of re-training and frustration, and why should I even bother?\n\nThat said, I don't think I can change your view. You like Windows 8, and matters of personal preference are next to impossible to change. For someone like you (who uses their computer for maybe 2 hours tops) it probably isn't that big of a deal. However, as an IT pro, who also does IT-type stuff as a hobby, and a gamer to boot, I spend a *lot* of time with my computers, and having a usable UI is paramount. Windows 8 was clearly designed around tablets, which is *fine*, but what works for tablets for UI design doesn't translate to mouse and keyboard. Imagine using iOS or Android on your desktop, and tell me that Apple would benefit from switching from OSX to iOS for their operating system on a Mac Pro (even though you don't like Mac)\n\n\n\nThese two things are mutually inclusive; Windows 8 does not exist in a vacuum. You cannot say that Windows 8 is bad or good without comparison in any meaningful way, because if Windows 8 were the only operating system, it would be both the best and the worst operating system ever, quite literally. So it is entirely valid to say \"Windows 8 is bad because Windows 7 is better\" as long as you back those claims up. To use a metaphorical example, I'm going to use chess: The pawn is not a very good piece. They're essentially your cannon fodder to sacrifice to keep your better pieces alive. But if every piece in chess was a pawn, they wouldn't be the worst piece anymore. Therefore, pawns are \"bad\" because other things are better. Because of the hierarchical nature of \"good\" and \"bad\" it is nearly impossible to say that something is \"bad\" without saying why something else is better, just like saying why something else is \"good\" is nearly impossible without saying why something else is worse. I notice that in your OP, you spent some effort comparing Windows 8 to Windows 7.\n\nResponse B Author: Kaluthir\n\nResponse B: I think there are a couple of reasons you believe differently than many/most people:\n\n1. Not that many people have touch screens. If you don't have one, a lot of the changes are pointless; you have to learn a new system for no real benefit.\n\n2. You couldn't ignore a lot of the changes, at least initially. I don't think the reaction to Win8 would've been as bad if it shipped with the options that 8.1 gives you.\n\n3. Speaking of 8.1, why did they distribute it through the app store instead of Windows Update?\n\n4. More on 8.1: my computer shipped with 8.0, but I upgraded to 8.1. This means I can't use the refresh/reset features, because I need to use 8.1 installation media that won't accept my 8.0 key. I would basically have to do a normal reinstall to 8.0, and re-update to 8.1.\n\n3. It's annoying to have Metro apps, and a separate desktop that contains all of the desktop apps. It just seems disjointed.\n\n4. The app store is pretty awful. \n\nI think a lot of the complaints were exaggerated, but there are a lot of things about 8 that are counter-intuitive.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Mavericgamer's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: By the time you finish high school, you are 18 going on 19 and practically an adult. I don't see why there needs to be a next step, another 4 years of education. I'm going into my senior year now but all the college talk from older friends is really starting to annoy me, because I know I have no choice but to go to college even though I hate the idea of it. \n\nWe go to college for 4 years and take a ton of classes, (English, Science, Math, History) all great learning experiences while you're young and help you decide what you'll want to do with your life. But after high school, most people already have a vague idea of what they want to do. If you want to be an engineer, you shouldn't have to pay between 10 and 60 grand a year to take 6 classes on engineering then another 30 on things you won't use in the future.\n\nIt's almost 3am and I'm having trouble wording this nicely, so I apologize for that. My main point is that instead of paying for college after high school, using your money and your parents money to pay for the salaries of the colleges' teachers, staff, sports, etc., each profession should just have their own training camp/classes. If you want to be an engineer, go to school for engineering. It could be the same classes you take in college without ones that won't help you at all. It would be a lot cheaper, and save a whole lot of time too. This sounds so sloppy and lazy and I apologize again, but I just had to get that out somewhere, didn't feel like taking the time to organize my thoughts. I want someone to convince me college isn't just a big waste of money because I'm gonna be pretty depressed going into it next year thinking like this. CMV.\n\n\nResponse A Author: SimpliFire\n\nResponse A: You seem to think that in university (not an American student here) you will be taking more classes which are not relevant to your career than you do. I'm not gonna try and change your view on that - go to any university website and find the courses you will have to take, you'll find that in most cases it's not true. \n\nThe idea of university in general is to give you the foundation for your whole life. Sure you're literate, you can count and you have some historical knowledge from high school, and depending on what you take at uni you will delve much deeper into your chosen area of study.. But it's not just about that.\n\nWhat I mean by the foundation of your life is that university is so much more than just learning things from a curriculum. University is where you first gain the freedom that has been (for most students in developed worlds anyway) kept from you. Don't want to go to class? Noone gives a shit. Don't want to do that assignment? Whatever it's your loss. When have you ever experienced the freedom to fuck yourself over and have noone give a damn? You fail a class and it's all on you - the university is not going to do a thing about it. \nIt's only when you get your head around the fact that there is noone (apart from family and friends of course) looking over your shoulder making sure you're on track that you learn to take responsibility for yourself. You learn that all your actions have a consequence, and you learn your boundaries in the process.\n\nI, for example, go to all my lectures for one class but don't go to ANY lectures at all for another. Why? I've learnt that in certain classes going to a lecture is just a waste of time, I can learn everything off the books. But more importantly, I've learnt that I have the ability to do so. Sure, it's backfired on me before, and I received a shit grade, but who cares? My lecturer? The university? Nope, just myself. A shit grade makes for unhappy parents (still using myself as an example), and if I continue getting shit grades, my parents will get angry, right? But does it stop there? No. Because I didn't take responsibility there might be repercussions down the line when I'm trying to get a job to further my career, for example. \n\nBut it doesn't just stop there. You might be thinking 'what the flying fuck so I'm paying thousands of dollars to learn responsibility'. It's not just that. University as I have said is the foundation of your life. It's where you network with other people; some of these people will be important and influence your life heavily, others will not. The point is, where else in the world are you going to be in an area where you have the opportunity to meet and become close with any number out of thousands of people? You might make close friends you know for the rest of your life, meet someone who can hook you up with a business deal later on, find your significant other, become close with professors who can write that sweet-as-a-motherfucker reference letter to help you get your dream job... \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is (it's late and I've been studying all day go figure)...\n\nUniversity is hella expensive, no arguments there. Some of the shit you learn here are next to useless and is a waste of time. But university is not just about finding out what you want to do, or learning the stuff that lets you do it. It's about using those few years to really start yourself off in the adult world. You learn time management, responsibility, how to suck up to people who can help you. You make friends, have awesome experiences, find people who will be helpful to you in the future..\n\nLike i said it's late and I cbf writing anymore but hope this changes your mind at least a little bit. Uni really isn't a time or money waster. It's an investment that pays off if you put the effort in\n\nResponse B Author: SeldomSeven\n\nResponse B: Hi. College student here. The vast majority of the classes I take are related to my majors. Electives generally account for roughly a third of your classes unless you're going for a degree of questionable worth. Folks I know that go to engineering schools seem to take mostly engineering classes. In fact, a major, well respected engineering school near me has been criticized for producing students that are too \"one dimensional.\" That is, they may be good at the nuts-and-bolts of day-to-day engineering matters, but some of them can't write a coherent paragraph to save their life or communicate clearly with other people.\n\nThe reasoning behind offering a liberal arts aspect to any form of higher education is that educated people ought to be at least aware of the basics of other disciplines. There was a day and age - that of the \"Renaissance Man\" - where the educated elite were expected to know higher math, science, economics, several languages, and be able to quote and analyze great literature. Rhetoric was also important. Why did they do that? Well, for one, intellectual curiosity drove a lot of polymaths to study a variety of subjects, but for another it makes you a more knowledgeable person and the interconnectedness of different discipline reenforces your skills. \n\nWhile I agree that it is frustrating to take a required class on, say, literature when one's forte really is in the hard sciences, you will go much farther in life if you have general knowledge available to you to supplement that specialization. Business-major types like to emphasize the importance of networking. You'll make more memorable impressions on people if you can contribute something to a conversation about their interests/field of expertise. Being formally educated in a variety of areas means you're more likely to be able to do that. \n\nI know it might not mean much to you, but even though I'm a STEM major, I secretly (and sometimes not so secretly...) judge people who don't get the references to Shakespeare that I might make, or who do not know what a \"Francophile\" is, or who think that WWII started in 1949. Now, that may not matter to you, or anyone else. But if I am one day looking to hire someone to work for me and you want that job, suddenly my opinion of you takes on a very practical value. \n\nOn a somewhat related note, I once read an opinion piece that said an intro psychology class is, perhaps, the single most valuable class any college student will ever take. If you can remember even just a few bits and pieces, you'll always have great cocktail party material to whip out and impress your fellow party-goers.\n\n\nAh, one more thing I failed to mention. Your main claim is college is expensive and not worth it. Statistics would suggest that college grads make quite a fair bit more money than high-school grads. And the cost argument is really sort of an American phenomenon. \n\nFinally, let's assume you're right and college really only gives you 6 useful classes and everything else is a royal waste of time. Well, the people hiring engineers still require you to have a degree. In fact, a lot of jobs these days don't care what you major in, just that you have a degree. We can throw away all the optimistic noble-minded idealizations of \"higher education\" but the fact remains a college degree is still a credential. High-school is similarly a whole lot of \"going through the motions\" and not much actual thinking, but that credential is also massively important for your financial future and that reality doesn't look to be changing any time soon.

It almost always happens in private, and rarely leaves conclusive evidence.  Something like murder is easy.  If there's a body, it's murder.  You don't have that ambiguity with rape.  There's evidence two people had sex.  One person says it was rape, one says it was consensual.  That's all there is to go on in most rape cases.

I believe a bit of common sense will tell you that there is in fact, 6, which would come about by combining Europe and Asia as there is an acute lack of an ocean dividing them, and should therefore be considered one and the same; Eurasia.\n\nMost people will tell you that they are divided because of such a huge cultural divide, but I think that that argument is flawed in that many completely different cultures exist on the same continent (e.g. China and the Middle East). So if we were to choose the number of continents based on culture there would be an endless amount of completely subjective possibilities, which means that this method is irrelevant.\n\nOne might argue that if we were to ignore culture and combine Europe and Asia, we would also have to include Africa to create a super-continent, and we would have to combine North and South America to make the Americas (for arguments sake, let's forget about the Suez and Panama canals).

How small does a land bridge have to be to be consider too small? How big does an island have to be to be considered a continent? It isn't any better than what we have, and will only lead to someone just like you visiting /r/CMV and complain about it. \n\nUnless we learn some fundamentally new concept that alters how we perceive continents, (just like how genetics/evolutionary biology changed how we perceived the concept of species,) then there is no reason to change it for something that isn't any better.\n\nResponse B Author: OakTable\n\nResponse B: Naw. If we're going to do that, let's go with four. America, Eurafroasia, Australia, and Antarctica.

It does seem kind of arbitrary to divide a continent in half and call it two, and when looking at a map and just having to imagine that there's a line somewhere around there is a bit odd, but it does have it's uses when referring to things and to which part of the world they have to do with.\n\nAlso, does the Middle East count as part of Africa, Asia, or Europe? It's always referred to as it's own thing as if it weren't part of any of those continents, but considering the Middle East isn't listed on its own as one of the 7 it has to be part of one of them, right?

It's myopic, callous, and condescending.\n\nNo one should feel guilty for being themselves. Ever. If who you are comes with the 'privilege' of being part of the majority, well that's life. I shouldn't have to explain that the majority of people are in a majority, that seems redundant - but these 'arguments' are always phrased as if that isn't the case. If who you are comes with the 'privilege' of being a minority, that's also life. \n\nThe arguments assume that the subject is incapable of empathy, and is actively attempting to hold to these 'privileges' and keep them away from everyone else. That's simply not the case. Yes, white men can walk safely down the streets in the suburbs, black men don't need to lock their doors when they roll through the ghetto, women aren't seen as creepy when they ask someone out - *good*, why is this a bad thing? In an ideal world, everyone would feel safe walking or driving in any part of town at any time, and no one would be treated as a creeper for expressing interest in another, and so forth. This isn't an ideal world - that may suck when situations where we don't have such 'privilege' are encountered, but that's life. \n\nWorse, these arguments require, by necessity, the outlook of a societal parasite. Rather than working to change things or make their own situation better, these people want to shame others for what they themselves don't have. As if screeching shrilly at someone that they should feel bad for being who they are, is somehow a morally superior stance.\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Wazula42\n\nResponse A: First of all, using the term privilege does not necessarily imply shame. If you feel that, then either they're misusing the term, or you've misinterpreted them. I'm found \"privilege\" in a social justice context to mean the same thing as \"ignorance\". A big part of intersectionality is accepting the fact that there are walks of life we can't understand; as a white man, I cannot understand some of the struggles a black person might face. Same for me and gays, women, whatever. When I am told to check my privilege, I understand that means I'm ignorant to an aspect of the minority experience, and I should make an effort to avoid this in the future.\n\nThere are aspects of being part of a group that's in power beyond just \"being in a majority\". Women, I believe, are actually a narrow majority in America right now, and they still have an appalling lack of institutional power, to say nothing of the numerous double standards and shaming tactics we use on them every day. By acknowledging that as a man I am in a privileged position, and perhaps acting to rectify that, I am doing my small part to challenge an existing status quo. By ignoring or denying my privilege, I allow this monopoly to continue.\n\nThat's the basis of privilege. It has nothing to do with shame; more often its used to counter shaming tactics. It just requires the listener be able to subtract ego from the situation and look at it objectively. As a white straight male, I was born with many arbitrary advantages. By acknowledging my privilege, I'm acknowledging that that's fucked up.\n\nResponse B Author: themcos\n\nResponse B: I see this sort of thing all the time, and I'm really not sure who you all are talking to who's telling you to feel *guilty* for you're race/gender/sexual orientation/whatever. I really really don't get why you think that's what anyone means when they talk about privilege.\n\nI'm a healthy attractive straight white male who was raised in a nice middle class home. I've got just about every kind of privilege I can think of. But I don't feel \"guilty\" in any way shape or form, because like I think you're arguing, none of this is my fault or even remotely reflects any wrongdoing on my part.\n\nBut I'd be a fool if I didn't acknowledge that these factors have helped give me an advantage in many aspects of my life. And when I go in to work and look around at my female coworker, my gay coworker, and my black coworker, its important that I acknowledge that many basic aspects of my life that I take for granted are not shared by them often (but not always)  in ways that make things harder for them.\n\nYou're not supposed to feel guilty, you're just supposed to acknowledge and understand how it affects you and others around you. You're supposed to think about it whenever you're tempted to judge others through the lens of your own personal experiences rather than trying to understand how the challenges they face may be different from yours. You're supposed to consider it when you think about the impact of public policy on those who are not like you.\n\nIf anyone is making you feel bad for how you were born, I'm sorry for that. They were either wrong, or you misinterpreted them.

However, when it comes to understanding and discovering general characteristics belonging to existing things, I believe that physics is superior to philosophy. Here are a few reasons why.\n\n*  Philosophy, since it is not experimental in nature, merely reorganizes knowledge and does not produce any new knowledge. \n \n* Descriptions in mathematics are less ambiguous, more strictly logical, and lead to greater insights than descriptions in English or any other language.\n\n*  Ideas in physics are much easier to test. \n\n*  Philosophy has no defense against counter-intuitive truths such as \"objects have a probabilistic rather than a defined set of characteristics\". Hence, any study of truth within philosophy will be limited by our own imaginations or intuitions.\n  \n* Newtonian mechanics, Big Bang, quantum mechanics, and relativity have done more to revolutionize our understanding of truth than any theory in philosophy.\n\n\nCMV!\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: \nBy the same token, does Mathematics not produce any new knowledge?\n\n\nWat?

Does the fact that your statement in the CMV title is not easily formalizable make it any less true?\n\nResponse B Author: desultoryquest\n\nResponse B: I'm not sure I agree with your first statement. For instance there are multiple philosophies of life and death that are completely new, just like the concept of electrons or whatever. For example the concept of \"karma\" or afterlife or the lack of afterlife or the concept of one god or no god. But obviously these concepts cannot be tested and I don't see how physics can ever answer them even if they do come up with a \"unified theory\" of how things work.\n\nDoesn't philosophy concern itself with things like \"what's the right way to live?\" and other questions of ethics that can never be classified into true or false boxes. Even if physics comes up with a set of all things empirically true or false, you still would not be able to answer the major philosophical questions.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author [deleted]'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

(cooking, eating, cleaning up, homework, some after school activities, kids bedtime, some free time to read/watch TV/game/reddit)\n\n\nJust the big scraps of leftover food. You don't have to rinse plates as some people do, in fact, it's better if you don't.\n\n\ntrue. But with a family of 4 the dishwasher is always full every evening, so there is very seldom 'dried gunk'. Occasionally (lets say once every 2 weeks in my experience) there is an item which needs manual washing since it didn't got clean.\n\n\nTrue, this is the case with most plastics. It's irritating and makes unloading the dishwasher a bit more time consuming.\n\nIn short. It saves people 'time'. A commodity which is very valuable for many families. \n\nResponse B Author: hermithome\n\nResponse B: \nIncorrect. My dishwasher doesn't require things to be \"pre-cleaned\". But even if it were true, you've got a bad assumption. Something that relieves you from X amount of time and work is a bad idea because it doesn't relieve you from all of it? \n\n\nIncorrect. I try not to let dishes get bad, and dishwashers won't handle large pieces of food properly, but they're good on everything else, including plates that have some tough to get off stuff. \n\n\nAnything that corrects water should be places so that the concave area faces down. If you do that properly, then you should have no problem washing tupperware and pots. I do so regularly.\n\n\nIt depends on who's kitchen you're talking about. It sounds to me like a couple of things are going on. You don't understand how to properly load and use a dishwasher, you have a bad performing dishwasher and you have a lot of bad assumptions about what a dishwasher is and how it's supposed to help. \n\nThe ordinary process of cleaning dishes is hard and timestaking for a lot of people. There are people with large families who go through enormous amounts of dirty dishes in a day. There are disabled people who can't physically stand at the sink long enough to do dishes. There are busy people who want their chores to take a little less long. A dishwasher isn't magical. It isn't going to scrub your pots or dry everything perfectly. It's not going to load itself or put your dishes away. It isn't going to tuck your kids into bed at night. But if you use it properly, a dishwasher can save you a lot of time. And it can make it possible for people who are disabled to live alone and take care of themselves.\n\nNow as to your personal issues, here are my suggestions. Read the manual for your dishwasher and make sure you're using the right stuff for it and following instructions. When you're done with a dish, remove any remaining food and rinse it before putting it in. Not wash it, just rinse it for a second. It also helps if you do this promptly after a dish is used so stuff doesn't have time to cake and grow. When putting in tupperware, make sure that you load it so that the water drains out properly. When the dishwasher finishes running, you may want to open it...that's one way to get remaining things to dry faster. \n\nNow yes, you still have to do some work. You have to scrape off any leftover food, lightly rinse the plates, put the dishes in properly and such. But you know what you don't have to do? Wash each dish fully.  \n\nIf that isn't enough of a benefit for you and you feel like you wasted your money, well, I'm sorry. But that's all dishwashers are intended to do, and it's something that many of the rest of us find valuable enough to spend the money on. \n\nIf you'd like to rant some more about how your dishwasher sucks, try another sub.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author littlegreenalien's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

But if you think mature adults can't change their opinions, how do you explain the massive shift in gay marriage over the course of about 10 years? [This news article](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/05/07/wsjnbc-poll-on-gay-marriage-2012-vs-2009-vs-2004/) documents a shift in opinion of about 20% to \"in favor\" of gay marriage. Over the course of 8 years, this is larger than the percentage of the population that can be accounted for by old people dying and young adults taking their place. So people definitely do change their views over their lifetime; most people who are racist, bigoted, or otherwise are so not because they are inherently bad people, but because they haven't been exposed to the correct kind of experience that makes them understand why their actions are wrong. \n\nResponse B Author: ILikeNeurons\n\nResponse B: \nYou would be interested in [this](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2011.00772.x/full) research article, which directly contradicts your assertion with regards to gay marriage. What the article shows is that 2/3 of the recent shift in attitudes towards gay marriage has been because of people changing their minds, and 1/3 due to the generational shift. The article was reported on in the [popular news](http://www.npr.org/2013/03/25/174989702/shift-in-gay-marriage-support-mirrors-a-changing-america) as well.\n\nYour view may be based on too short timescales to see the effect. I've personally been credited with changing people's minds about bigoted ideas, and it was a slow, arduous process that took years, picking away at assumptions and misconceptions over time. There's also research showing that if you can explain to someone *why* they are wrong, they're more likely to change their mind. Simply telling someone they are wrong or racist is seldom effective. If you've not been engaging in the kinds of tactics that have been shown to work, that could also explain why you hold the view you do.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author nikoberg's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Not Gray's, not the Baltimore PD's, and not the rioters.\n\nHowever, it seems to me that Gray was, for lack of a better description, a scummy piece of criminal shit. The guy was a known drug dealer with almost two dozen criminal charges at the time of his death. The man was not a positive influence in his own life or in the lives of those in his community and contributed nothing to society. It is unfortunate that his family has to deal with the pain and sorrow of losing him, and it is equally unfortunate that the situation in Baltimore has grown to the point that it's at now. But I don't see why it's so bad that he's gone.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: rbrychckn\n\nResponse A: You may be apathetic to him exiting this world but do you see no value in him still being able to interact with his sisters and parents?  Perhaps there were young kids that he positively influenced.  His criminality says nothing of how he positively impacted at least *some* portion of humanity.  I don't think any of us know the circumstances of his life and his criminal record well enough to categorically state he offered *nothing* to humanity.\n\nSecond, do you think the murder or manslaughter of people you judge as \"scummy pieces of shit\" is acceptable?  If so, where does that line get drawn in the future?  I think that's the exact reason people are protesting (I talk of the peaceful law-abiding protesters).  Freddie Gray may not have been a perfect person in this world but that doesn't mean he should have been killed or any of us needed to help him leave this world.\n\nLast, your viewpoint leaves no space for anyone who made a mistake to be able to make reparations and actually contribute positively to society.  What if he went to jail and got out - could he potentially contribute to the world at that point?  No one knows the answer to that and to conclude the world is better off with him gone is reckless.\n\nResponse B Author: cleansoap\n\nResponse B: Being as you don't know how the human Freddie Gray would have acted outside the horrific environment of West Baltimore what I hear you saying is that it is ok to judge (if not condemn) humans who may only be victims of their circumstances.  People do what they need to do to survive the pressures they find themselves under.  Unless you know the circumstances of one's life I'm not sure calling someone a \"scummy piece of criminal shit\" for a list of non-violent drug dealing charges demonstrates much understanding of the real world.  I rather strongly believe it is an attempt to impose some sort of unilateral moral framework onto an environment in which it can be pragmatically shown not to work.\n\nYou should change your view because the only backing one can have for such a view is ignorance.  Maybe he is a scummy piece of criminal shit, maybe he isn't.  But you don't have any real objective information, not enough to draw a sound conclusion at least.  So by holding such a view you're telling the world and telling yourself that judgment based on shitty data is OK.

CMV\n\nOp: **I think my view has been changed. I don't think I'll ever be a sports fan, but many of you had really great points as to why sports or the discussion of sports. Thanks to all who gave great answers and weren't jerks!**\n\nSports are great for exercise, and to an extent they are good to have at a pro or semi-pro level for entertainment. However, I think the fact that a huge number of people follow teams, players, or sports in general religiously is ridiculous. When people are dying across the world due to civil war and starvation, the average person on the street knowing next to nothing about our political system, and the presence of hundreds of other actually important topics of conversation available, what the hell is the big deal about games? Sports are a waste of time and conversation.\n\nI found a post similar to this from a few months back, but there were few responses. \n\nWith a husband who is a sports fanatic, I would love for someone to CMV. \n\n\nResponse A Author: themcos\n\nResponse A: I'll give you a few examples that I think demonstrate \"value\".\n\n1. My friends and I get together on Sunday and watch a game. We order a pizza, grab a few beers, and enjoy each others' company for the afternoon while leaving ample downtime during commercials/halftime/postgame to talk about whatever. It might seem mundane, but for many people, its awkward to socialize just for the sake of socializing, even if they would actually enjoy it. It might seem too mundane to be an answer to your question, but really, sports are just one of many ways to bring people together, and I think that's great.\n\n2. I love my dad, but we're not chatty people, and we live on opposite sides of the country so we don't see each other that often. I'd love to call him more, but honestly we don't always have that much to talk about. But I love football season, because we have the same favorite teams and can have great conversations about the past weekends games. And during the course of those discussions, other topics inevitably come up that probably wouldn't have warranted a phone call on their own. So its not just about talking with my dad about sports, we end up talking more about *non* sports as well. And again, this isn't unique to sports, but its something we're both interested in and tends to be a bit better of a conversation starter than civil war and starvation.\n\n3. The last example/story is the one I actually find most interesting to me. As you might have guessed from my first two items, I'm not the most extroverted person, and it makes it easier for me to have *reasons* to interact with people, even though the interactions are often their own reward. But every live football game I've been too (three so far), circumstances have led to me organically sharing a positive social moment with a complete an utter stranger. Even if its as simple as a couple of high-fives, as an introvert it made a huge impression on me that for that moment I could bond with a person who I knew literally nothing about over a shared experience without even a twinge of anxiety or awkwardness.\n\nThe way you describe it, it sounds like your husband might take things a bit too far, but for me Sports have been a conduit for me to maintain and create relationships with friends, family, and even total strangers. Its probably not unreasonable to ask your husband to take a night off from sports-talk once and a while, but its worth considering what kinds of genuine social connections he gets out of his interest in sports.\n\nResponse B Author: CherrySlurpee\n\nResponse B: Sports are great entertainment for those who enjoy them. They bring more joy and sadness than movies, books, games, etc, ever could for me, because they're real. \n\nBut you seem to have the opinion that \"why are we out there throwing a football around when there are starving kids.\" That I would say that we need a form of entertainment. Something - a movie, a book, a hockey game. Whatever it is, we need a release. The world will *never* be free of starving people, disease, etc, and we all need an escape from something.\n\nBut anyways, back to my original point - sports are better entertainment value for a lot of people. \n\n[This kid](http://deadspin.com/cleveland-browns-let-little-kid-score-touchdown-1019122455) probably had the time of his life. (long story short, the Browns let a kid score a touchdown during a practice). \n\n[This](http://whatthepucknow.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/ray_bourque.jpg) brought tears of joy to millions of people (One of the nicest superstars in hockey history finally wins a championship after 20 years). \n\nWatch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MRoIDXeuY) and tell me you don't tear up a little bit. \n\nJust like how Star Wars fans are cheering for Han Solo, Red Sox fans are cheering for their baseball team (or, well, just *against* the yankees). It gives an entire city \"something in common.\" I've had countless conversations with complete strangers about how my Red Wings are doing. Its something that brings us closer together. And even though the Wing's \"rivals\" are the Blackhawks, I still have bond when we jokingly talk trash to one another. Its something you don't get out of two people who enjoy Harry Potter books. I can go up to almost anyone in Detroit and start a conversation with \"how bout them Tigers, eh?\"\n\nIn the end, its great entertainment, and brings fans closer together in the end.

The worlds such a messed up place though; I wouldn't feel right putting another person through it all. The world is progressively getting worse, and by the time my child is grown up they must be subjected to some awful things.  Much worse to what I've experienced. Everyday on the news I see endless amounts of saddening, worrying or scary news. The amounts of conflicts and struggles in the world are more prevalent then ever before.\n\nIn my personal experience my parents had it much easier than I did; there was less people in Canada which means that competition for Universities, jobs, and things like that were much less competitive. There were less awful occurrences such as school shootings, terrorist attacks and so on. Environmental problems were an issue, but people lived in ignorant bliss.\n\nThe world is in a progression of getting worse, so why bring another person into it?\n\nResponse A Author: agentxorange127\n\nResponse A: I think that the state of the world should not necessarily influence your decision to have/not have children. The whole \"the world is getting worse\" idea has been around for all of history. It's just a depressing feature of being an intelligent being (the fact that we have to worry about how our actions affect others).     \n    \nWhy is the world getting worse? Technology is progressing at a much faster rate. There are no World Wars, no conflicts where hundreds of millions of people die. We hear more \"sad\" things only because we have access to vast amounts of information, more than we have ever had access to before. There are more people, yes, but that seems to not be the reasoning behind you not wanting to have kids (which would be an arguable reason).     \n     \nThe whole \"the world is going to shit\" is not a great idea to have in your head. Other than the fact it is depressing and doesn't make you have a very good worldview, it is also just not true. People have had that attitude for ages, but the world progresses none the less. That attitude leads to becoming a old-timer who just raves about how much simpler a time it used to be while being completely ignorant of today's society; someone who looks to the past, and not the future. \n\nResponse B Author: Combogalis\n\nResponse B: \"The world is progressively getting worse\" is a sentiment that every generation seems to believe despite the world clearly being better now than possibly any point in history.\nViolent crime has been on a steady decline for decades.\nThere are fewer wars.\nJust about every major problem in the world is on the decline: poverty, hunger, disease.\nTechnology is fixing problems once thought unfixable, and people are becoming more aware of how what we do can affect the world.\nYour parents didn't have terrorist attacks or school shootings but had to deal with the constant threat of the Cold War, fearing any minute they could just die.\n\nWhether you want to have kids or not is up to you, but the world getting worse is untrue and a poor reason to begin with.

What counts as racism?**  \n\nHere, today, there are several generally accepted classes that a majority of people feel comfortable defending; the LGBT community, minorities, women, and non religious or very small minority religious groups, to name the most prominent.  However, this doesn't take into account what may be considered \"bigotry\" down the road, nor does it account for groupthink and discrimination against unpopular groups, especially groups who happen to be unpopular to the majority of reddit users; /r/politics is a great example of a group of people who literally cannot stand conservatives, for example.\n\n**Second, better the devil you know than the devil you don't.**\n\nHaving these places in the sunlight (relatively speaking) allows for several things; one, it allows people to know whether or not this activity is actually still occurring or not.  Two, it allows people the chance to critique it and potentially draw those who might be influenced by arguments that seem sound to see the *other* side of the argument, and become more open minded; jihadist rhetoric is often banned from the so called public square, and as a result it takes residence in the nooks and crannies of the internet, where it's not vulnerable to be challenged by less radical parties.\n\n**Third, no one is perfect.**\n\nJust because someone has a negative and even patently wrong view on a particular issue doesn't mean they can't be constructive members of society or a community in other ways; that guy that built that great cabinetry set last week and posted it to /r/DIY may feel that gay marriage is a sin; does that make him any worse at building cabinets?

After it was written, there were months of back-and-forth with his editor.  \n\nAll told, I'm sure there was over a year's effort spent on it.\n\nWhen he was finished, his was one of many similar books on the topic on a fairly specialized topic.  He also refused to release multiple editions (which are mostly done to make the earlier versions obsolete, so students can't but used books).\n\nSo, let's do the math.\n\n[There were 19,000](http://www.asee.org/papers-and-publications/publications/college-profiles/2011-profile-engineering-statistics.pdf) Mechanical Engineering students in 2011. \n\nLet's say you have an extremely popular book that's used by 25% of them (or 4750 students).

When does he get to see his family? Can he just hang out on a Thursday night watching Jay Leno or whatever the fuck without preparing a speech or reading over some law meanwhile?  I on the other hand need almost an hour to fully wake up, and if I get less than 6 hours of sleep I simply won't function.\n\nEvery decision he makes will influence a shit ton of people, and no matter what he decides there's always millions who'll hate him for it.\n\nAnd what does he get in return? Sure, the salary is attractive, it's what, around 300k? But a person of that caliber could probably make that many times over in industry. He obviously gets a lot of power, but I honestly don't see why you would want that. What is it about the idea that you could, I don't know, start wars if you wanted to? Is the idea that you get to decide which bills are being signed into law really that enticing? I don't know. Maybe I just don't get the appeal of \"power\". Would I be corrupted by it if I had it? Would I see it differently?

Sure we are wealthy (in as much that the majority of our people do earn a living wage), but when did \u201cgreat\u201d turn out to mean \u201c85% of people are above the poverty line, and we\u2019ve still got nukes\u201d? I think a great country needs to be measured by so much more than that, and that\u2019s the impact I\u2019d like to have. \n\nI think a great country needs to prioritize education so that the generations we are raising have the most potential for success than anyone who has ever preceded them, and I think the infrastructure needs to support this. I think that a great country truly gives the power to the people, and that state\u2019s rights and responsibilities should be of paramount importance. I think a great country is innovative and proactive, rather than operating under the \u201cthis is how we\u2019ve always done it\u201d line (I\u2019m looking at you, *War on Drugs*)\n\nPeople who are driven to the prestige, gratitude and fame of public office are doing it for the wrong reasons. \n\nResponse B Author: ItsAnElephant\n\nResponse B: I would like to think that people will try for the position under the wish to do good for their country.

Parents who deny their children the right to vaccinations because of their superstitions or religious beliefs are harming their children and should be held legally responsible. Failing to vaccinate either your child and even yourself is irresponsible behavior and not only are you putting your child at risk, but you are also putting others around you at risk as well. Children who can't receive vaccinations and develop immunity to the diseases rely on the community to get vaccinated. Therefore, refusing to vaccinate your child is not only a form of child abuse, but it is also putting others at risk. It's not a personal choice issue. It's civic responsibility. Everyone should be vaccinated and everyone should be required to vaccinate their children.\n\nResponse A Author: Life0fRiley\n\nResponse A: It's only dangerous to children if they were to get the disease they were not vaccinated to. What if a parent not vaccinate their kid because he knew that there was a strong herd immunity in the area that he lives at?  There is no danger and the possibility of getting the disease would be very rare. I would guess that does not constitute as child abuse. \n\nResponse B Author: zmett15\n\nResponse B: This is a very bold claim that you are making. Child abuse is defined as \"physical maltreatment or sexual molestation of a child.\" Clearly, there is no physical maltreatment or sexual molestation of a child just because someone does not receive a vaccination. Some people do not have the money or resources to give their children vaccinations. Also, it is the parents decision on whether or not to give their child a vaccination and the parents usually are thinking in the child's best interests. One cannot be held legally responsible for not giving their child a vaccination; that is ludicrous. I have never gotten a flu shot and have never gotten the flu!

Same logic, but in reverse for children. If you need to be on welfare because you can't afford food, or housing, then you should not be able to have children you wont be able to afford to feed and care for. Too many people in my area, and I'm sure across the country are living off welfare that was meant to be used as a temporary helping hand to get people on their feet. If you end up pregnant you either abort, give it up for adoption, or get taken off welfare. \n\n\n\n\nwell after reading all your points, I wish to change some of my viewpoint. I am all for the people who get fired, or laid off being able to get assistance, and I wouldn't want to see anyone's kids actually taken away, so for those who asked about working mothers losing there jobs, no, they should definitely be able to keep their children. same goes for if they are pregnant when they apply. my biggest problem with the welfare system is when I see families with 5+ kids, a PS4, putting big stereos in their new cars, still collecting welfare, and living that way for years. things like unemployment, you are suppose to be looking for a job, using the money till you get one. if your testing positive for the harder drugs, chances are your not going to get a job, seeing as most jobs drug check now. \n\n\nThanks to KevinWestern about 90% of my viewpoint has changed. I still think they should have to pass drug tests occasionally, because if they have money for illegal drugs, they have money for basic living needs, and shouldn't need assistance, but it's not the children's fault, and they shouldn't be punished or denied the chance to live because of their parents.\n\nResponse A Author: KevinWestern\n\nResponse A: I can perhaps be persuaded to entertain the Drug test idea, but Birth Control?

CMV\n\nOp: Thinking to the recent Le Vell possible child abuse case in the UK: we have an actor who was accused of abusing a child over multiple occasions.\n\nThe press, naturally, dragged his name through the mud thinking this case would go the same way as all the other abuse scandals from the last year - only he was found Not Guilty on all counts.\n\nBut this will change the rest of his life forever. Innocent until proven guilty means nothing in the court of public opinion. There are those who will never believe him, those who say \"it just wasn't proved\", those who say \"no smoke without fire\". He will never be able to go near a child again without people watching his every move like a hawk. He is also less likely to be believed if someone else decides to claim he abused them merely by association to the first case.\n\nSo I understand we don't want to put the fear of jail into potential victims, and I get that someone's going to tell me that conviction rates are lower than one would believe from the media, but neither of this changes my mind that in a case of \"my word versus yours\" where no physical evidence is brought forward: someone must be lying. Either the accused is lying and will be sent to jail, or they aren't and will (hopefully) be acquitted. Whereas for the accuser: if they are telling the truth (hopefully) the accused is put away, but if they are lying - nothing happens.\n\nIt just seems to me that when one side has so much to lose, the other side should too as a course of balance.\n\nAs I mentioned above, Le Vell would most likely not be believed now if another \"my word vs yours\" case came against him about child abuse. Now immediately you might jump to saying: if two people accuse him then they probably weren't lying, why would two people lie? My answer is: because people do. All the time - whether it be for fun, profit, fame - and in this case there is no downside - there seems to be no risk to accusing someone in a case of \"my word versus yours\" where no physical evidence can prove the defendant is lying, but no physical evidence can still be enough to see them put away.\n\nCMV\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: There's a crucial, massively important difference between \"not guilty\" and \"innocent\". If someone stands trial for a crime and there's not *quite* enough evidence to make it obvious beyond reasonable doubt they are guilty, they'll have a not guilty verdict recieved- and that means if you rape someone, then hide the evidence well, you could feasibly not be found guilty of rape, then actually be able to force the (genuine) victim to prove they aren't lying, which would be fairly traumatic and a really strong disincentive to ever reporting sexual assualt when you don't have concrete evidence. As an example, OJ simpson was found not guilty of murder in criminal court, but then in a civil suit he was found guilty of manslaughter and forced to pay damages. The criminal court requires there be evidence beyond reasonable doubt whereas the civil court only requires  it's more likely than not that the crime was committed, so here even though the US justice system decided there was a &gt;50% chance he did it he was still found not guilty.\n\nIn Scot's law (IANAL but I'm pretty sure of this) there's an \"innocent\" verdict in addition to \"guilty\" and \"not guilty\"- you *might* be able to argue that in situations in which an innocent verdict were returned the accuser should face trial, but even then you're going to discourage the reporting of abuse on the off-chance the abuser prepares for it and fabricates some kind of alibi\n\nResponse B Author: SwizzySticks\n\nResponse B: One of the most important things to keep in mind in a court case is that the defendant is found either \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\", and not \"guilty\" or \"innocent\". The reason why this is important is that innocence implies that without a doubt, the defendant did not commit the crime he stands accused of. On the other hand, \"not guilty\" means that the court cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty. This is the law's way of saying that the defendant very well may have committed the crime, but there is not enough evidence to prove it. In the occasion of a \"my word versus yours\" case, such as the one you described, the court is **not** saying the accuser is lying, it is saying that there is not sufficient evidence for a conviction. To put the accuser on trial for perjury would be contradictory to the very nature of a \"not guilty\" verdict. Furthermore, don't you think people would be a whole lot more hesitant to report crimes if they knew they would be prosecuted simply because the defendant was found not guilty? The very reason why we do not put accusers on trial is so that no one has to fear the consequences of reporting a crime.\n   Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author [deleted]'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

This **does not** mean how the *group* as whole is better off, I'm only concerned with the *individual*. \n\n**Why I think this:** Since health insurance is a **business** which is primarily focused on making money, I see no reason why has any responsibly to support it unless they choose to do so. Basically, I'm under no moral obligation to subsidize this industry because it exists only to make money.\n\n\n**Supplemental:** I keep hearing on NPR how there is concern that not enough young and healthy people are buying health insurance. This does seem like a problem since the economics of insurance rely on more people paying into it than are using the services. From the insurance industry's perspective, it is a huge problem if too many sick and old people compared to healthy and young are insured because it basically causes the whole system to collapse. I understand the economics behind it, however, that doesn't mean it is in the individual's best interest to support this system. \n\nI feel that it might be important to add that I'm not one of these individuals who doesn't need insurance. I'm young, but I have a chronic condition and so I need health insurance. Also, I personally think healthcare should be somewhat like the security industry: if you want/need you are allowed hire private security but everyone has access to police.\n\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: Under the ACA, young people can stay on their parents' insurance until they're 26. Let's look at the average 26 year old individual. If they went to college, they probably have some level of student loan debt. They also most likely are either still in school or working at an entry-level job (or close to an entry-level position). This is a younger individual, so they are probably in decent shape in terms of their health, and assuming that they don't have any chronic conditions that require consistent medical care, they probably could get by without insurance. But, what happens if, for some reason, they do need some type of medical care? What if they get in a car accident? What if they fall and break a bone? What if they get sick and need to go to the hospital? Any of these things would result in extremely high medical bills that a young person probably can't afford to pay. This would then put this individual at risk for bankruptcy, which would then hurt their prospects of getting a good interest rate on a loan, which is something that younger people need to buy a house, car, etc. Basically, things happen, and if a younger person needs medical treatment for something then they probably can't afford it without insurance like an older person might.\n\nAlso, I'm one of these younger people who will need to start looking into my options for health insurance. I'm not 26 yet so I'm still on my parents' plan, but I do have a chronic medical condition that requires me to take medicine everyday that would be pretty expensive without insurance. I'm also about to graduate college with some student loan debt, and plan on pursuing a higher degree which will give me tens of thousands of dollars more of student loan debt. Since I'm just starting to look for a job, my options are generally only entry-level positions. Basically, most young people like me wouldn't be able to afford an average medical treatment without health insurance.\n\nResponse B Author: Chronoblivion\n\nResponse B: It's hard to argue that a person should take an umbrella with them when they look out the window and see only sunshine, but I'll give it my best shot:\n\nAt what point should a person get insurance? Imagine if you were allowed to drive without insurance, but could buy it after getting into an accident and they would be legally obligated to pay for said accident. Kinda bullshit, right? That's essentially how the health insurance system is set up now. I'm not suggesting we should return to denying people for \"pre-existing conditions\" because that's even more bullshit, but by buying into insurance after getting sick, you're abusing the system and raising costs for everyone, yourself included. Would you rather spend $200 a month for 60 years, or $500 a month for 30 years? What's good for everyone is good for the individual in this case.\n\nAdditionally, sick people without insurance are unlikely to seek medical assistance unless it's an emergency. They are then more likely to infect infants, the elderly, and others with compromised immune system who might not get over it as easily and could have it develop into something much more dangerous. Again, mostly an argument for group benefit &gt; individual, but on a personal level I wouldn't want something like that on my conscience.\n\nI know neither of these are very compelling arguments, but within the restrictive framework of Randian self-interest, it's the best I can come up with.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author [deleted]'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: I'm not referring to some sort of god-based determination. It seems to me that the view of causal determinism is pretty much true. \n\n\nAny action that we take results from prior causes, which, in turn, resulted from prior causes. Any thoughts that one has are a result of chemical reactions in the brain that exist because of a prior state.\n\n\nThere's also the studies that have surfaced in light of Libet et al's tests a while back. From what I've read, the brain functionally decides what the body is going to do before a persons thoughts catch up with their actions. Change my view.\n\n\nP.S. Let's not make this a \"God exists\" discussion, we'll save that for another CMV.\n\nResponse A Author: ErasmoGnome\n\nResponse A: But we can't know that.\n\nReality isn't simply just a program, running to completion. Or at least, form our current understanding of physics, nor do all chemical reactions have one given outcome, at least at the atomic level.\n\nActually, since this is a question of physics more than chemistry or philosophy, according to our current understanding of the laws of quantum mechanics, there is not a definite result at any given time. Particle attributes such as speed, spin, and location can be expressed by probability waves, and there is no one definite result. Einstein disagreed, bringing up hidden variables, but he was proved wrong by numerous experiments. So unless proven otherwise, current knowledge holds that you are wrong: Time is not a progression from A to B but a randomized dance that could end up infinite different ways.\n\nBut all that means is that chemicals mixing can be different on a molecular level, which can have an impact on the brain. I would say this would be hesitant evidence for the existence of free will - life is not a simple progression from A to B. There are no foregone conclusions; our lives are up in the air. This does not, of course, confirm that we are the ones making the decisions, but it is a step closer to that conclusion.\nThere is even some debate as to whether there is a comprehensive, universal theory. According to a great Hawking book I read about physics, there are currently three things that could be true about our ability to understand the universe:\n\nThe laws of our universe are impossible to understand; they cannot be fathomed and we'll never get there. This has already been proven fairly false - we've made great strides towards understanding.\n\nThe laws of physics are convoluted enough that we'll never get to perfection. It will be like listing pi - you'll be more an more precise as you go along, and after a point you may as well be exact, but you will never get exactly there.\n\nThe laws of physics are expressible through mathematics to perfect certainty. This, clearly, is what everyone is hoping for, and what you assumed is true about the universe. Unfortunately, if the universe does really work under rules of probability even if this is true, we'll never be able to predict the future with perfect certainty.\n\nSo in conclusion, I would say that since the universe doesn't work on a strict A to B progression, and everything is built and seems exactly as though humans have free will, there are only two logical conclusions to come to: Either we have free will, or we have a perfectly functioning impression of free will that completes the same result. The quote \"What if gravity doesn't exist, but a force exactly like gravity does\" comes to mind. I personally am a proponent of the first, partially out of optimism and partially because there is enough evidence that a perfectly functioning system that imitates free will but isn't just doesn't seem as likely to me, from my own version of an applied Occam's Razor.\n\nResponse B Author: Zorander22\n\nResponse B: The universe exists. From this, there are two possible explanations: \n\n1) Something has always existed. \n\n2) Something came from nothing. \n\nIf something has always existed, then it is possible (but not certain) that everything is caused by what has occurred previously in an unbroken line stretching back forever. \n\nIf something came from nothing, then we know that it is possible for something to occur without a prior cause. \n\nWithout more information, both options are equally likely. Within the \"something has always existed\" option, things may still not be entirely determined by previous causes. So, without further information, it seems like the odds are in favour that not everything is predetermined. \n\n\"Free will\" if it exists seems intimately linked in with consciousness. We have determinism from our understanding of the physical universe. We have some ideas of what things that are conscious look like at physical level (re brain structures), but we don't have a way (to the best of my knowledge) for being able to explain the existence of subjective conscious experiences. That is, we can learn of physical things, and even see that those physical things influence mental states, but we don't have an understanding of how physical things can produce the subjective conscious experience that we have - knowing neurons can form new connections doesn't necessarily tell us about the _experience_ of it. \n\nSince free will (if it exists) is tied in to something that we don't understand how it is linked to the physical world, and our understanding of causality comes from the physical world, it is premature to decide that free will doesn't exist. The physical can affect our subjective conscious experiences, but that by itself doesn't mean that our subjective conscious experiences can't also affect the physical, or that they must necessarily follow the same rules.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author ErasmoGnome's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Heath Ledger was another example. Robin Williams, too, would not have been thought as much more than a comedian until given the right opportunity. Or Will Smith. We may soon be saying the same for Jesse Eisenberg.\n\nGiven the quality of script, the careful directing, the number of takes and feedback and cues an actor may take to get a scene right, the music which can be an emotional trigger; it is hard to imagine any professional actor who could not be coaxed into giving stellar performances.\n\nObviously people will cite examples to the contrary, but to compare Gary Oldman who is widely regarded as a master actor, I've recently noticed the previously unremarkable aussie actor Joel Edgerton being cast as Rameses in the upcoming Exodus, and I think that it may not take much to make a competent actor \"chameleonic\".\n\nBasically, I believe any competent or trained actor can be coaxed to give outstanding performances with the right directing and production. There is less variety in the capabilities of professional actors than the fandom of A-listers suggest.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Dr_Wreck\n\nResponse A: You can't make a marble statue out of cement.\n\nYes all those other things go into the final performance, but a good analogy is an artist blaming their tools-- a good chisel helps make the statue, a good planning and sketching is critical-- but if you are not working with marble you simply cannot work miracles. No matter what lighting you use to display it or how hard you work, you will not be able to compete with the versatility and range that marble has. \n\nThink of the number of big budget movies with legendary directors who have put out a movie ruined by a single actors in ability to act. They were competent enough to get cast by professional casting agents and vetted by those legendary directors, but they still flopped and tore down the rest of the movie with them.\n\nFrom another angle, I've seen actors take **absolute shit** on the script and directing and do something magical with the role. For reference, I work in theater very often, and in the amatuer scene the writing and directing is almost always -not great-. But you know the \"good\" actors in your area, and without ad libbing lines or without disobeying stage direction, they still take absolute horseshit and polish it into something fascinating to watch. \n\nAt the end of the day the best analogy is really what we are actually talking about, all the direction and planning in the world is just building to execution, and any profession with that disconnect between planning and execution will tell you execution is the most important part.\n\nResponse B Author: leif827\n\nResponse B: I'm never going to deny that a good script/director does magic.\n\nHowever, as someone who works in a smaller theatre community: there are actors in each community that are known as the \"good actors.\" It's well known that any show they are in will turn out to be a good show, or at least entertaining, regardless of the quality of the script.\n\nAlso - auditions. It's amazing to see how people can make monologues come to life. With many people performing the same monologue, it's fascinating to watch how some absolutely make it come to life (without lights, directors, etc) while some end up just reciting lines.\n\nI wouldn't think of it as everyone is a good actor; rather, with good actors, the script/directing/cinematography serve to ENHANCE their acting, whereas with only competent actors those elements serve to MAKE UP FOR their decent acting. A great actor could do what he does without the help of all these things, whereas a bad one needs those things to make the film seem good.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Dr_Wreck's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

It seems that we agree at a basic level. CMV\n\nOp: The hypocrisy of the American \"war on terror\" seems oddly transparent. It is safe to say that it is a fact that far more foreign civilians have died in this enterprise than American civilians. So, the question I've always wanted answered in our debates about justification is: \"How many foreign civilian lives is an American civilian's life worth?\" \n\nIf the answer is anything other than &gt;1, I can't see any way to justify America's actions. Though I have heard many people from every political persuasion justify, I have never heard anyone explain this basic inequality of human value that underpins the whole philosophy. Do we not value American lives more than foreign ones, and how is that more justified than any other groups feelings of exceptionality?\n\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: Let me start by saying that I don't agree with the \"war on terror\".  As a result don't mistake this counterpoint as a moral justification.  It's more of a technical one.\n\nYou might have a misunderstanding of the \"job\".  The \"job\" of the armed forces, homeland security, etc. is to protect *American* lives.  That's what their mission is, that's what they are paid to do.  The inequality isn't viewed by the actors as a moral justification.  They don't get paid to mitigate losses to other countries citizens or make moral determinations about the value of life.  An American life is \"worth\" more because America spends more money to protect it.  If the conflict country did / could spend as much; fewer of their civilians would die.\n\nForeign citizens die more often because they don't have sufficient advocates internal to our system or sufficient advocacy from their governments.  They will likely never gain advocacy from the US since doing so essentially takes time, money, and resources away from the job of saving Americans.  Failing to save Americans results in political and budget loss.\n\nResponse B Author: A_Merman_Pop\n\nResponse B: 1.\nThe US government does value American lives more than foreign lives. This is the purpose it was created to serve. All foreign governments do the same. If you hired a bodyguard to protect you, you expect him to do it. Does this mean he's morally reprehensible for thinking that your life is inherently worth more than all the others he could be protecting?\n\nIn a perfect world perhaps, all governments would look out for the interests of all the people of the world equally. However, in the current human condition we have a sort of coordination problem. If everyone else is looking out for their own interests, and you are looking out for everyone's interests, your own interests are going to receive the least attention and you will end up in the worst position of all.\n\n2.\nYour post seems to me to be an oversimplification of the situation. It makes it sound as though there is an algorithm.\n\n1 American life = x foreign lives. Therefore we will kill x-1 foreigners for every 1 American we save.\n\nThis isn't the moral justification anyone would use for the war on terror. The thought process goes a little more like this:\n\nThe benefits of living in a world where crimes are punished and where terrorism is not tolerated are probably greater than the risk of casualties from innocents caught in the crossfire. Of course no one can objectively prove this to be true, but it is not a wholly unreasonable statement.\n\nThe fact that the potential casualties are mostly foreign is not the determining factor behind this philosophy. The [Waco Texas Siege](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_Siege) is a good example of the US government risking American casualties for this same ideal.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author [deleted]'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Slowly it went from almost exclusively online, to now being more prominent and accepted in the real world. \n\nWith this new brand of activism and \"acceptance\" it seems as though if you're not attracted to every single variance of the opposite/same sex, you're labeled an asshole, shallow, transphobic, racist, or any other less than favorable terms. I feel it is wrong to berate, reprimand, or otherwise harass people who take preference in their sexual/romantic partners. \n\nAn example of this is the \"fat acceptance\" movement. I'm attracted to petite women. I don't know why, I just am. I have thus far, never been attracted to an obese woman, as I don't find that body type attractive.

Like maybe you associate black women with being loud and aggressive, and you don't like loud and aggressive women, so when looking at a black woman you might subsconciously lower her rating a bit based on this stereotype.\n\nIt's not quite the same for weight, especially as it can have genuine health issues, but I'd still want to scrutinise someone who claimed they could never be attracted to an overweight woman. There are a lot of good reasons but I'd still imagine there's a pretty decent correlation between *expressing* that opinion and subscribing to /r/fatpeoplehate.  \n\nResponse B Author: CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH\n\nResponse B: I'll address parts of your CMV because some parts are correct and some aren't.\n\nYou are correct that it is fine to be not attracted to a certain gender or weight class of people because those characteristics change every single physical feature of that person. The reason why you'll see many people claim that everyone should be/is bisexual is because they are bisexual and desperately want to be normal. I say this as a bisexual who went through this phase.\n\nBut one common theme that we see is people saying that they are not attracted to anyone who is transgender or anyone of a certain race. This is wrong and indicative of a prejudice and I will explain why.\n\nFirst let's go over transgender people. If you are not attracted to *all* transgender people that is perfectly acceptable. No one is saying that you should be attracted to Bruce Jenner just because he says that he is a woman. He still looks like a man and therefore it is very reasonable for you to not feel any sexual attraction towards him.\n\nBut there are plenty of transgender people who are completely passable as their new gender. For example [there is this fun quiz where you are meant to guess which of the two was once a man](http://cavemancircus.com/2010/02/11/test-your-power-of-deduction-man-or-woman/) \n\nIf someone is to make the blanket statement that they are not attracted to any transgender people then they are likely transphobic. One common argument against this is people saying they want children, but this argument falls apart when you question whether or not they would date a women who can't have children due to a medical issue.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author honeypuppy's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

All nuclear facilities ought to be shut down.\n\nOp: I think investing in nuclear energy is one of the most foolish things that mankind has ever done. The sheer amount of energy it yields is certainly enticing, but I do not think it is worth the risks it entails. My primary reason for despising nuclear energy is that in the event of a failure at a nuclear facility, the results are catastrophic. Many people claim that nuclear power plants are safeguarded with redundant forms of security making a meltdown \"impossible.\" I do not buy it. No matter how many safety regulations are implemented, I think nuclear meltdowns are inevitable. These facilities are run by two things: people, and computers. People, even highly trained people are fallible, and I have used computers for far too long to trust that these computers are error proof. What's more, we have historic precedents of nuclear meltdown and the natural turned nuclear disaster in Japan to show us just how naive it is to think that nuclear energy is safe.\n\nWhen a hydro-electric power plant goes out, people lose power for a while. Huge inconvenience for a lot of people, possibly even a bit destructive, but ultimately not a huge deal. When a nuclear power plant has a meltdown the entire area must be evacuated, people's lives are put in danger, and the environment is polluted with radioactivity for over a century. Nuclear power plants are a threat to the communities they reside in and every nation ought to begin taking steps towards shutting down such facilities.\n\n\nResponse A Author: JustsayinwhatIthink\n\nResponse A: Not all reactors are alike.\n\nThe Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR) has incredible safety compared to that of other reactors. It doesn't require high pressures like those used in pressurized water reactors such as the plant in Fukushima Daiichi. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor#Safety).\n\n[This](http://youtu.be/uK367T7h6ZY?t=1m31s) video has some useful information on the basics of LFTR; I linked to the part about preventing meltdowns. If you are interested, there is a longer version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG1YjDdI_c8).\n\nAs explained in the video, nuclear meltdowns occur in traditional water cooled reactors when power is lost. But a LFTR would be passively cooled, and would not melt down even if all power is lost. \n\nResponse B Author: YossarianWWII\n\nResponse B: [This](http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html) data shows that nuclear power is the safest form of conventional energy in existence, despite the fact that we are using technology that is decades old.\n\nNuclear energy seems to be more lethal because the deaths are not gradual, as they are with fossil fuels.  They are grouped together, but the groups are set so far apart that they average out to almost nothing.\n\nAlso, only three nuclear incidents have reached the highest danger level set by the international community:  Fukushima Daiichi, Chernobyl, and Three Mile Island.

A lot of people seemed to be of the opinion that having a working phone with you while driving is just too dangerous. The phone should be put away and turned off to avoid temptation and anyone seen with their phone behind the wheel of a vehicle should be fined/arrested/whatever.\n\nI then admitted to often having my phone with me while driving, but I added that I only ever allow myself to use it when the car is standing still (If I'm parked, waiting at a traffic light or just plain stuck in unmoving traffic). I got down voted to oblivion, but no-one offered a reason for disagreeing with me.\n\nSo, if anyone here feels that it's unacceptable to ever use a phone behind the wheel of a car, please change my view on the matter.

I mean, sure you can blame the kid, but *you're* the one behind the wheel with a licence that says you are responsible enough to drive, so you are the one who should be paying attention on the road at all times. \n\nI don't think it's any more appropriate to escape into your phone during a red light than it is to   finish the next chapter in whatever book you're reading or pop in a dvd watch your favorite episode of The Office. (The one where Michael hits Meredith with his car comes to mind.) It's just not the right time or place to do that. \n\nThe biggest problem, to me anyways, is that is takes your focus away from the task at hand. Sometimes when you try to do too many things at once you end up doing a shitty job at everything because your attention is spread too thin. I think texting at a red light could easily be one of those situations. You may get out a little text at this red light, read the response at the next one, but you can't really give it your full attention because you are driving, and you aren't giving driving your full attention, because you're texting. \n\nI think when we are driving, sharing the road with other people, it's important to be present and aware. Cars are big, heavy, fast, and can kill people.

When I look at luxury cars, I see...tan/cream-colored leather interior, a powerful motor, and that's it.  I'm guessing that you're paying mostly for the little sticker that says the name of the car manufacturer instead of any actual benefit to the car.

I'm no expert, but my understanding is that the difference is that they're basically hand made.  Leather is hand stitched, they have a wood working shop, it's all carefully hand crafted.  And as a result of all this, not many of these cars are made, which make the price higher.  The Rolls Royce Ghost is a 4-door sedan with hand-made interior that goes 0-60 in 4.7 seconds and it costs around $250k.  I don't think it would be possible to easily produce and sell a car of similar quality for less.\n\nFor people who have many millions (or billions) of dollars, the difference between a $100k and $250k for a luxury car isn't that big of a deal, and I think some rich people spend a lot of time in a car.  \n\nSometimes they just like to own a unique item, but also a status symbol can be worth a lot of money sometimes.

This is still relying on society though if you want this land to have protected status.\n\nIf you do *not* want any sort of protection of this status, however, then in what way will this land remain free and stateless?  Let's say the United States agrees with you, and in a miraculous move of generosity gives up all claim to the entirety of Alaska and says anyone who wants to opt out can live there.  The land is now open and unclaimed by any state...so is this band of ex-pats that moves there going to defend against Russia?  Because the land is no longer part of the U.S,  Russia can annex this new open land and there is nothing anyone can do about it unless they want to go to war with them.\n\nI also want to point out that even within the land itself, ignoring all governments,all it takes is a wealthy guy hiring a group of mercenaries and marching into this land and taking full control over it as his own, and your open land is gone.\n\nThis is the real point here:  the reason that essentially no such habitable land exists today is because unclaimed land is a vacuum.  It will fill itself in.  There is no way for you to stop the more powerful, whether an individual or a county, from taking it over in about a week's time, and then the whole concept is moot.  The plan would fail even if accepted.\n\nResponse B Author: Gralthator\n\nResponse B: It seems like most of your points don't really apply specifically to modern society, things like being born or having to exist in a society until you are old enough to be able to function on your own would be true of any human child from any society, from a single baby and its mother to a full modern republic. \n\n\nI'm not sure which Modern Western societies hold children in debt for the cost of raising them, but I'm not familiar with it. \n\n\nAnyone can run off into the wilderness at any time and live a prehistoric existence. There are huge stretches of wild land still on the planet, and you can just go and live in most of them as best as you can, just as our ancestors did many thousands of years ago. There may be places you cannot live as you see fit, but that is always true. Either environment or other creatures will limit where you can live to a degree, but there are still plenty of places to go completely off the grid.\n\n\nWhy do you say no way exists to opt out of the system? I am free to leave the country and to go wherever I can, by whatever means I have. The fact that I can't obtain money without being a part of the system so I can buy a plane ticket is irrelevant, as I can still walk/swim just as far as any human ever could (generally speaking). \n\n\nThis seems like an overstatement at the very least. If you have the freedom to walk into the woods and disappear, and no one will hunt you down and force you to come back, or even try to stop you leaving in the first place, then I don't see how you can be considered a slave.

CMV\n\nOp: I think drinking in high school is ignorant because it can lead to poor decisions such as drunk driving, unplanned/unsafe sex, etc. I personally believe it's unnecessary because, quite frankly, I've gone through high school so far without drinking (I'm going to be a senior) and I've had plenty of fun. Finally, I don't think it's worth the danger because I know kids who are already chronic alcoholics. Additionally, many kids (even at my own school) have been caught drinking and driving, speeding while drunk, and have gotten into accidents (non-fatal) due to their level of intoxication.\n\nI understand there are safe ways of drinking and having fun in high school. I just personally don't think those are worth the risk. Granted, I've never drank myself. So go ahead, CMV!\n\n\nResponse A Author: 294116002\n\nResponse A: I'll agree that if you are unsure of your own self control and/or have an addictive personality, drinking (at any point in your life, really) is a bad idea. If, however, you are truly confident in your ability to stop when you've had enough and not drive if you've had any (neither of these things are particularly difficult), what's the problem? When I was in highschool, I drank with my group of friends but we never left my house and never did anything that could be potentially dangerous. \n\nResponse B Author: jesyspa\n\nResponse B: From the perspective of someone in a country where alcohol is 16+: occasionally drinking in moderation during highschool is a *great* idea if you plan to go to university.  You are at a point in your life where you are legally assured you have people backing you up.  Losing your job, girlfriend, or flunking some important exam may be inconvenient, but it is not the end of the world.\n\nOf course, there's still stupid things you shouldn't do; this is the chance to learn your limits.  Discover that drunk biking does not work (driving is 18+).  Realise that getting drunk does have an effect on how well you can perform the next day.  Make the mistakes you'll make anyway, early on.\n\nWaiting with this until university is possible, but I wouldn't recommend it: the amount of money you can spend goes up significantly, as does the availability of free or cheap drinks.  You might rent a room, which would make alcoholism much harder to notice for your parents.  You're also already 18, which could make certain crimes count much heavier.\n\nThere is the risk of ruining your liver/brain by overdrinking early on; I certainly don't recommend that.  However, abstaining entirely during highschool just raises the risks later on.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author 294116002's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

We should also be encouraging sexual experimentation and teaching how to improve one's own sex life.\n\nOp: I reiterate: The message of sex ed shouldn't be \"We're not endorsing you having sex, but *if you do*, you should be safe\". Instead, we should *actively encourage* teenage sexual experimentation (under safe conditions), and teach them practical lessons about how to have good sex.\n\nNote that I'm limiting this to older teenagers - I'm not sure it's necessary to teach early teens how to be good at sex. This is mainly about 16-18 year olds and such.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\nFirstly: **Sexual experience informs people about their own sexual identity -** so by encouraging strings-free sexual encounters, we encourage long-term relationships between sexually incompatible partners. You know how since the gay rights movement, *so* many previously married people have realized that they're flaming homosexuals and have decided to get divorced? Have you ever wondered how someone could *possibly* be in a long lasting marriage without even realizing they're *not attracted to their spouse*? The answer is obviously that **they got married before having a mature understanding of their sexuality**. This is only changing because in recent decades it's far more acceptable for people to have sexual relationships before marriage - and it seems reasonable that people with sexual experience are more likely to understand their own sexuality.\nFurthermore, oblivious homosexuals are just the tip of the iceberg. **There are** ***so*** **many sexual identities and quirks that can make people incompatible**. Take asexuals, as an example. I'm inclined to believe there are many more asexuals than we realize, given *how damn long* it takes for some of them to realize that they don't even enjoy boning. [Scott Alexander, a blogger who is asexual, writes about this experience](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/):\n\n\nScott also happens to be an unusually progressive person when it comes to these matters: if he, a progressive male, took forever to realize that he didn't like sex, how long would it take for a woman from a more conservative background? Imagine if that woman got married without much sexual experience to a heterosexual man? She would feel pressured to endure something she hated, and her entirely well meaning husband would have an awful, chemistry free sexual life. **Had she experimented when she were younger, both partners could have ended up in far more satisfying relationships.**\n\nSecond: **When men are not taught about sexuality, they 'learn' from porn instead.** I don't need to throw statistics at you for you to know that porn use is almost universal among sexual young men with internet access. I don't have anything against porn at all, but there is *absolutely* a problem when that's how men are learning about sex. This is because for the sake of aesthetics porn paints a grossly distorted mirror of what sexuality is like - whether it's the women who have screaming orgasms from vaginal intercourse alone, or the men with 8\" penises who can fuck for hours on end, or the idea that facials are a typical part of sex and something that most women enjoy - porn is absolutely *rubbish* for education. I know this from experience: I started watching frequently from when I was about 12, and it was my *only* source of sexual knowledge until I lost my virginity. For *three years* I was eating up this shitty misrepresentation of female sexuality, and I believed it for much longer. Going on into adulthood I still had no idea that women need clitoral stimulation, and I only learned because I'm interested enough in the topic to have actually read books about this. I doubt most men have.\n\n**Yes, this has consequences**. Namely, that many straight women have rubbish sex because men watch so much fucking porn. A while ago I asked /r/askwomen whether they had faked an orgasm before. The majority said yes. One reply was particularly illustrative:\n\n\n\nCan you honestly say that this would have happened if her boyfriend had learned about sex from anything other than porn? When guys are taught that women are *supposed* cum, or that they're *supposed* to enjoy straight vaginal, this is exactly what happens. Finer details, like the importance of reciprocity and foreplay that's enjoyable for both partners, are totally ignored. This can ruin relationships, or at the very least make them very unhappy. **By providing a realistic and detailed description of sexuality for teenagers, this can be completely avoided**. \n\nLastly: **Knowledge about sexuality, whether it's for adults or teenagers, is bad on an epidemic level.** The Hite report, which is admittedly a bit old now, found that [only a quarter of women regularly orgasm from vaginal intercourse](http://www.the-clitoris.com/vaginal_orgasm#.VNQ2_p2UckM). Meanwhile, a further quarter has never orgasmed from intercourse at all, and another 12% *have never orgasmed ever*. For a majority of women, orgasm is no easy feat; you need to be in the right mood, you need to be highly aroused, you need to be stimulated in *just the right way*. My SO, who is by no means chaste, came from intercourse for the first time a good few months after we'd started regular sex - and that took *work*. It turned out that she could only come if she was lying in a certain position, had a vibrator on her clit, and we were doing it for a reasonable while. That women frequently have specific requirements for orgasm is not obvious to most people - giving us these horribly low rates of sexual satisfaction. \n\nThis is not obvious for men *or* women. Women I've talked to frequently say that they *didn't know* they were doing something wrong; that sex was something that only men could enjoy. As far as I can tell, physical intimacy is hugely important for successful relationships among sexual people; **so by providing men and women with a good idea of how to make sex enjoyable (which they need), we improve people's chances of successful long term relationships**.\n\nMy other points are mainly elaborations of those: That teenagers are forming ideas about sex *anyway*, so we might as well give them a good one; that it would most likely destigmatize sexuality, which would be good for everyone; that teenagers would associate the sexual health they're taught in the same class with their sexuality, so sexual health would probably be taken more seriously; that upon knowing what a healthy sexual relationship is like, people can also know if they're in a sexually abusive relationship.\n\n**TL; DR Teaching teenagers about sex and encouraging them to safely experiment will help people understand themselves better, help them and their partners enjoy sex more, and help them establish happier relationships. Change my view.**\n\nApologies for the essay.\n\nResponse A Author: graciegraciegracie\n\nResponse A: A lot of people in this thread are taking your viewpoint to a bit of an extreme - I don't actually think your advocating pussy-eating classes.\n\n\n\n\nI think you have a point in that \"safe sex\" is taught from a purely physical and medical standpoint (condoms, birth control, etc) with not much emphasis on the emotional or psychological side. I believe that is largely due to many reasons that people have brought up in this thread - the immaturity or otherwise of teenagers, the difficulty of pinning down what is \"good\" sex, the danger of pushing a certain type of sexual activity as \"normal\", etc etc. I understand why educators would shy away from teaching improvement or experimentation for these reasons, but you're correct in saying this leaves us with a sexual health program that could be considered deficient.\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to bring up my high school sex ed classes because I think they may bridge that gap. We worked with a group called \"Condomania\" that came around once a year to hold mandatory workshops for students from grade 8 to 10. The teachers were not involved, and the Condomania staff were all in their early twenties, energetic, funny, and irreverent, which put a lot of the students at ease and allowed them to open up a bit more with their questions. All the workshops included jokes, skits, quizzes, group discussions and (most importantly, imo) a box where students could submit anonymous questions to be answered at the end.\n\n\n\n\nThe Grade 8 work shop was about consent and respect for your partner. This didn't necessarily branch into technique - all the staff had to do was emphasize how important it is to listen to your partner, respect their choices and desires above all else. We were told not to expect anything of anyone that they weren't prepared to give. \n\n\n\n\nThe Grade 9 work shop was about sexual health and family planning - condoms, birth control, STDs, diagrams of the uterus, timelines of fetal development, the whole nine yards. We were also taught how to put on a male condom, and how to apply lubricant. We were told it was important to use condoms for vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse, and it was also important to change condoms in between different types of intercourse with the same partner. We were taught how to apply dental dams and female condoms. We talked about masturbation, and even about sex toys, although without much detail. No one of these things was emphasized more than the other, which made all of them equally \"normal\" or \"acceptable\". We were taught how to experiment safely without being told to go experiment. \n\n\n\n\nThe grade 10 workshop was about gender roles. In this workshop we were encouraged to roleplay different scenarios such as \"picking someone up\" at a bar, or \"going on a date\", or \"meeting the parents\", and examine the different expectations for men and women in these scenes. We discussed the different barriers that the LGTBQ community faces, and how to be respectful of people's gender presentation in all circumstances, not just sexual. I don't recall discussing sex much at all in this workshop, but the connection was certainly made between having a strong sense of sexual identity, and having good and safe sex. \n\n\n\n\nI feel like this succeeded for two reasons: Teenagers are smart, and if you try and tell them how to run their lives they'll stop listening to you. If any of these people had told me sexual experimentation is good for me, I would have reacted as though I had just been told abstinence is good for me - namely, \"you don't know what's good for me\". Which is, I believe, the correct reaction. No one should be pushed one way or the other, whether by religiosity, shaming, or health reasons. Instead, give them all the information they require, allow them to explore gender and identity in a safe setting, emphasize respect and safety, and they'll be able to make the journey on their own. \n\n\n\n\nAs a disclaimer, I grew up in a liberal Canadian city with a large gay population that was fairly well represented within the school, so while this class was received well in my community I'm not sure how it would do in more conservative areas.\n\nResponse B Author: jakethespectre\n\nResponse B: While I agree with most of the points you present, I really don't like the idea of encouraging teenagers.  \n1. **Sex creates emotional bonds between people.** Even if the school is encouraging casual sex, that doesn't mean there isn't an emotional bond between people when they have sex. As discussed on another CMV, I think some people are meant for casual sex and some people aren't. And the people that aren't could be emotionally damaged by having casual sex.  \n2. **Sex requires maturity.** Some people, whether they want it or not, aren't ready. I think health classes should definitely destigmatise sex and make sure even teens from middle school understand that sex is a natural/normal thing. But some people at that age will still be immature about it.  \n3. **So much drama.** This is also partly to do with my point on maturity. If immature people are having sex and being super open about it, even you have to admit that there's going to be a lot of shaming and bullying (in today's culture). I could see a lot of these quotes going around schools:  \n\"Her vagina looks weird\"  \n\"He lasted 2 seconds\"  \n\"She has pepperoni tits\"  \n\"He has a small penis\"  \n\"She queefed omg how weird\"  \nTeenagers would spread so many rumours. \n  \nWhen people understand that all body types are normal and are mature enough to use the sex to get to know themselves better without becoming emotionally attached or spread rumors or shame people that have decided not to have sex, then *maybe* I could support this. But otherwise most teenagers would be too judgemental or immature to do this.  \nThis isn't to say I think teenagers shouldn't  have sex. If they feel they're ready that's great, and destigmatising it is the first step. But when the school system encourages them to have casual sex, it gets weird. These are some things I am going to write but am too lazy to make arguments for.  \n  \nWhat happens when teens don't have safe sex even when the school is encouraging it? This goes against what a lot of religions value. Parents probably don't want their son/daughter having sex. Would the school be sued if someone gets a permanent STD after having sex because the school encouraged it and a condom broke or something similar? This could backfire and cause them to have less sex (ex: omg my weird teacher is telling me to have sex, sex must be really weird.) Also would teachers telling students to have sex be sexual harassment? It seems like it's similar even if it's not.

I\u2019ve been to a few stereotypical high school parties where people have asked me why I don\u2019t drink on several occasions. I really have no specific reasons as to why I choose to abstain: I\u2019m not religious, can\u2019t dismiss it due to taste (although I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s fairly awful), have no history of alcoholics in my family, etc. I usually just go with excuses such as \u201cI just don\u2019t drink\u201d, despite wanting to respond with something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t want to become like you\u201d after seeing what drinking does to friends and classmates. As a result of not drinking I\u2019ve stopped going to parties, as have the number of invites stopped coming. Six months into university the drinking culture is even worse than before.

As I don\u2019t drink and people seem to be somewhat weirded out by that, I\u2019ve yet to attend one of these uni events. \n\nNot that I think adults or more *sophisticated* drinkers are any better.

Please CMV.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: BroCube\n\nResponse A: I'd like to take a moment to change your view on one smaller point in your post, if I may:\n\n\nFrom the outside looking in, it can seem absurd, I grant you that. I used to think that all wine just 'tasted like grapes'. It seemed ridiculous, the way some people went on about a drink that wasn't even that great. But then I made a friend who *was* a wino. Consistently, he would bring wines to barbecues and dinners that weren't all bad, pleasant even, and actually really did go nicely with the food he brought. This sparked my interest, and I allowed myself to consider that maybe winos weren't all just crazy.\n\nWhat I discovered is that wine is *fascinating*. The exact same grape, literally a genetic clone, *really does* taste different if grown a kilometre apart. You wouldn't notice it if you're just chugging down purple whatever at a party, but when you compare the two side by side, the difference is astounding. Once you discover this variance, you'll inevitably find you like some things about wine better than others. \"This one tastes bad to me\" and \"this one I like\" doesn't help you find more of what you like, so you have to figure out what it is about each wine that appeals to you. That happens by defining characteristics. \"This riesling kind of has a... I guess lime-like flavor to it, which is too sour for me. But this other one is... I guess crisp, like a green apple is crisp?\" You pick it up really fast, and it becomes *fun*.\n\nThe thing is, it really is just fascinating, and discovery and learning end up becoming a hobby. It becomes more about learning *why* grapes do the weird things they do than even about drinking. I could read about wine all day, just learning more about the science behind the why, or other cool new discoveries, without drinking a drop. I go on wine tours and spend days tasting without swallowing so much as a mouthful. It's a hobby, a passion. It doesn't have to be everyone's hobby. But like any hobby, it's fun for the people who are into it. That doesn't make them pretentious, elitist, crazy or a joke. And the added bonus is that it instills a much better attitude toward alcohol, *and* toward actually appreciating the senses and enjoying life, not just \"cramming whatever in to get the job done\". It's the equivalent of learning to \"stop and smell the roses once in a while\".\n\nThat said, once you're in it, and you really know what makes a shitty wine taste shitty, it's hard not to snark at bad wine. That's where the pretentious air comes from, it's the mistake winos make of knocking bad wine *because* they know what good wine is and can be, and if others just... knew or listened to them, they could share in a more enjoyable experience. It isn't about thinking you're better than others, you just want to share this great thing with people. But... it's easy to get blinded to tactfulness. So it *can* come off as pretentious. I apologize on behalf of wine snobs everywhere for this. We just want to share.\n\n\nResponse B Author: TheAngryBrian\n\nResponse B: \nHow can you say people seem weirded out by it when you've never even been to one?\n\nI don't know what your university is like, but only complete dickbags would get on someone's case about not drinking. You're not in highschool anymore. People drink, yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean they expect YOU to. Least you be considered one of the \"uncool\"  kids. You're with relatively mature adults now. I think you'd actually find that a lot of people have respect for your abstinence from alcohol as a personal choice.\n\nBut that doesn't really challenge your view, so I should probably pick some other stuff to talk about.\n\n\nDepends on what you're drinking and where your taste is at. Some people can sip straight up vodka and enjoy it...somehow. Other people stick to things like Mike's Hard Lemonade, which tastes nothing like alcohol. I personally drink wheat beers and hard cider and stay away from hoppy beer. I enjoy some mixed drinks, but I don't like doing shots (although I HAVE a had a honey whiskey that tasted REALLY good).\n\nYou should really experiment with alcoholic drinks. Chances are you might find one that you really enjoy. Beer is hard to get into. I'm still trying to get myself to really \"like\" beer, although I'm just convinced at this point that it sucks outside of doing anything but complimenting the taste of a good steak.\n\n\nWhat do you mean by this?Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author BroCube's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

This seems like a terrible idea, because giving the government more control over regulating the internet opens it up for over regulation and abuse. The railroads have hardly innovated in decades and are abysmal for passenger traffic. I wonder how much better they might have been with competition. CMV.\n\n\nI think the fact that corporations mostly want profits is actually better for the state of ISPs--it means that if a corporation comes along that provides a far better product (like Google Fiber, and I'm waiting for more to come) they can push Comcast &amp; co out of the market entirely. With government regulation, those companies will be protected in their positions.\n\nOverall, I'm not convinced that the government will make the right decisions or do anything other than impede the progress of the Internet. Neither will the current ISPs in the field, but without regulation at least other ISPs have more opportunity to enter. If anyone can show me that I'm wrong, I'll gladly CMV.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Waylander0719\n\nResponse A: One of the best examples of why we need regulation is the current fight between level 3 and Verizon.\n\nLevel 3 is the long distance ISP that also hosts most of Netflix's traffic. Verizon recently posted saying that the reason that Netflix is slow for their customers is because of Congestion. Verizon even shared a neat little info graphic on where the congestion is.\n\nHere is Verizon's post:\nhttp://publicpolicy.verizon.com/blog/entry/why-is-netflix-buffering-dispelling-the-congestion-myth\nAnd the Response from Level 3:\nhttp://blog.level3.com/global-connectivity/verizons-accidental-mea-culpa/\n\nBasically it boils down to, the congestion is happening between 2 modems sitting in the same room. 1 owned by Verizon and 1 owned by Level 3. Currently there are 4 connections between the 2 modems and room for 4 more connections. Level 3 has been asking for Verizon to allow them to connect the other 4 ports (therefore doubling the size of the link) in order to alleviate the congestion.Verizon refuses to do so unless Level 3 pays them.\n\nBut here is the rub. Why should Level 3 pay Verizon for providing the service that Verizon's customers are demanding and paying for. Why shouldn't the reverse be true? Verizon's customers are demanding and paying for Verizon to connect them to where they want to go on the internet, so why shouldn't Verizon be paying Level 3 for a larger pipe that allows them  meet the demands of their customers?\n\nThe ideas and regulations for net neutrality are simple, and were infact already in place for the last 5 years, and more or less followed before that through peering agreements. The idea of net neutrality is to make the pipes of the internet neutral to allow for innovation on the side of content not delivery. To allow things like netflix and youtube and facebook to startup. While ISPs are an important component of the internet, the real innovation isn't in how the data gets to you it is what the data is. You could have the best internet speeds in the world, but without sites and services that were worthwhile you would never want to use it. A neutral intenet is one that is unlimited in its potential for innovation.\n\nResponse B Author: NaturalSelectorX\n\nResponse B: \nDo you realize that the US government essentially *does* regulate the internet? ICANN (the organization that ultimately controls domain names and IP addresses) is controlled by the US Department of Commerce. They operate with a lot of independence, but the US has the ability to cause a lot of damage if it chose.\n\n\n\nHow does net neutrality hurt competition? Isn't the most competitive environment the one where everybody has a chance to compete? If you run a medium-sized website, you could be blocked or slowed down by a big ISP because you can't pay the toll. \n\nThe whole point of net neutrality is *to encourage competition*. A major concern is someone like Verizon or Comcast screwing with Netflix traffic to make their own service look more attractive. What if AT&amp;T makes Vonage calls choppy to promote their own service? These examples show how it hurts competition when you are not neutral.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Waylander0719's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

The two main parties campaign crazy hard while the third guy, since he has a job and not very much free time, really only tells his close friends and family. \n\nIf in this district people choose to vote negatively more than they choose to vote positively, it is very possible that both of the main parties could have a negative vote balance while random guy has a positive vote balance of 5 (his mom and dad, brother, and a couple other people he plays soccer with).

Our government has been handed to us on a silver platter of voting, yet year after year we elect the same fucking two parties that seem bent on destroying our national credit and stuffing the pockets of the elite in our society.\n\nThe people that would benefit from electing an independent party member for a change FAR outnumber the people sending their millions to superPACs, but because people can't be bothered to read a few articles about what's going on in our country, the same shit is happening year after year.\n\nAnd that's not even the worst part.

Whatever, one day I'll be rich and won't have to worry about it.\n\nIt's at the point for me where I have zero national pride and just want to leave. This can get very expensive though, and I would genuinely appreciate anyone who can re-inspire some hope.

One thing you have to think about is how much national problems affect you personally. Some things, like wage disparity, health insurance coverage, and taxes do impact you personally, but foreign policy, military spending, and corporate tax breaks don't necessarily affect you on a daily basis.\n\nYou also have to consider your future in the new country.  What will you do?  Can you pursue the same career or find a new one?  Will you make enough money to live comfortably?  Wages in the US are still higher than most of the world, and Americans still enjoy a higher standard of living.  For example, I work full time as an English teacher in a big universtiy.  I make about 15,000 a year, and my salary is significantly higher than average for a native English teacher in my area.  While some things are cheaper, like rent, other things, like clothes, electronics, and food, are more expensive.  Overall, the standard of living is significantly lower, and most people live month to month, paycheck to paycheck.\n\nAside from finances, changing to a new country involves a lot of personal sacrifice.  Leaving friends and family behind is tough, and forging new friendships and relationships can be challenging, especially if there's a language barrier.  Culture shock is real, and you'll learn to appreciate some things about American culture that you had taken for granted before.  Overall this can be a positive experience.\n\nAfter I've reflected on my comments, depending on where you are in your career, I would recommend that you *do* leave the country for a short time.  Maybe do a stint in Asia or Latin America teaching English for a year.  It'll give you new insights into what is really good and bad about America.  It's valuable work and life experience, **BUT** don't burn any bridges back to the US.

CMV\n\nOp: I really don't like this aspect of my personality and would love people to give me some examples of why this prejudice is massively flawed. I'm not talking about people who are a little overweight (people like food). I'm talking about scooters in the supermarket and walking sticks for getting to the car. People who blame hormones or metabolic rates are trying to find external justifications for their predicament.  I knew a girl in school with a genuine hormonal problem which caused a puffy face and water retention. She had a good excuse. The majority of people don't.  I have seen older posts on this topic but I was not involved in the discussion and would like to talk about this and hopefully CMV.\n\nResponse A Author: The_Dead_See\n\nResponse A: I'm obese, and I think I can legitimately argue that I'm not lazy or stupid. Before anyone bails thinking I'm going to claim illness or genetics as a cause, I'm not. It is wholly my own actions that have led me here and I take full responsibility for them.\n\nObese people generally know more than normal weight people would ever know about losing weight and how the body functions. I could talk with you all day about TDEE, basal metabolic rate, the energy equation, hormonal controls, the structure of lipids and how they accumulate in the body. I could probably serve as a dietician and physical trainer effectively. I could tell you all about the merits and disadvantages of specific eating approaches. I could tell you about the most recent studies regarding workout efficiency. I could tell you about all the myths like negative calorie foods, cleanses, cardio zones, and starvation mode. So stupid, no, not when it comes to weight gain and loss anyway. \n\nLazy, that's trickier - if you consider lazy to mean not moving enough to create a caloric deficit based on how much energy you consume, then yes, I'm lazy. But I go to the gym twice a week, I walk 2 miles every day, and I'm a caregiver and home owner so my physical chores don't end when the work day is done.\n\nSo why am I obese? Habit is the answer, and habit is not thing you can really brush off as a product of stupidity or laziness. Put simply, my battle with weight is a battle with forty years of very gradual caloric surplus. It's also a battle with slightly deficient psychological coping abilities. Years of therapy have taught me that I have tended towards eating as an escape from stress, distress, boredom and a variety of other emotions that everyone develops different coping mechanisms for. Some people escape into drugs, alcohol, sports, computer games, tv, masturbation, fetishes, shopping, gambling... Whatever gives them the chemical fix (and yes, it's all about serotonin and dopamine and a variety of other chemical messengers in your brain). I escape into food... \n\nI guarantee you also have escape activities and coping activities. Ask yourself what they are and imagine knowing that unless you give them up they would dramatically increase your risks of early death and make you a social outcast. Could you?\n\nAdd to this the fact that the odds are stacked against emotional eaters in some very specific ways. For one thing, food is extremely hard to avoid. If you have an addiction to cigarettes or alcohol or gambling or drugs you can basically lock yourself away from those things until a new pattern of habit is formed, but food is in your life and around you every single day. You don't have to eat junk food to get obese... You just have to consume more energy than you burn - even just a few calories a day over your TDEE and given enough time you'll get there. Emotional eaters are surrounded by their drug every minute of every day. Imagine being a smoker who was trying to quit but every day a platter of cigarettes was placed in your office kitchen, billboards for them scream at you on the way home, smoking ads fill your tv, your spouse presents a pack to you for your evening sustenance, every family gathering is centered around and focused on smoking... I hope that gives a sense of some of the difficulties.\n\nI won't even get into the research companies that load pretty much every packaged foodstuff in the western world with sodium, fat, sugar and various other chemicals specifically designed to addict people to the products.\n\nMy battle with weight continues, and will do so until I either succeed or die. It's a battle with habit, addiction, emotion, and I implore you to have a little more empathy for people in my situation. Putting it down to something as simplistic as laziness or stupidity is really quite inaccurate and also adds to the exhausting, ostracizing world we obese people have to inhabit. \n\n\nResponse B Author: phantomganonftw\n\nResponse B: I can't speak for every fat person, but I can tell you my experience. I'm not really sure where you draw the line for extreme cases - I don't need a scooter at the store or a walking stick to get around, I can walk across campus to my classes (although this is Florida and it's hot as hell, so I take the bus often, at least to the classes that are more than a mile away - we have a big campus). I can walk up the flight of stairs to my apartment without getting winded, but I'll get a little tired after 3 or 4 flights. So, you can decide for yourself whether I'm the person you're thinking of. (Incidentally, I do have multiple symptoms of PCOS, a hormone imbalance that can make it hard to lose weight, but I know that's not the main cause of my weight. The main cause is that I don't spend time focusing on losing weight.)\n\nI've always been overweight, ever since I was a little kid. I didn't have siblings to play with, or neighbors my age, so I never learned very good social skills or how to play with others. Also, because there was no one for me to play with at home, I read. All the time. In 4th grade, I remember going to the library instead of recess because I didn't know how to make friends or play with other kids. Add a case of asthma into the mix, and I never learned good exercise habits.\n\nIn high school, my weight problems were compounded by stress eating and spending most of my time working on school or reading instead of doing physical things. While these habits weren't good for my weight, they got me a National Merit Scholarship that covers all of my tuition, books, and housing, and leaves me a little more money for other living expenses during the fall and spring semesters. I think that probably proves that I'm not stupid or lazy, just that I have different priorities than other people.\n\nBecause I spend so much time working on school/extracurriculars, I don't have time to work a regular job (I'm on my school's debate team and we travel a lot. Because we're gone so much, I can't find a job during the school year). That means I don't have a lot of extra cash lying around. Unhealthy food tends to keep me from being hungry longer than healthy food for the same amount of money or less. Because of that, I tend to eat a lot of foods with high calories but few other nutrients (I eat a ton of ramen, macaroni and cheese, and spaghetti). Again, it's not so much a matter of being lazy as a matter of having other priorities.\n\nI spent a lot of my life being told by everyone around my that my weight was somehow an indication of my intelligence levels or work ethic, and when I was younger I took it really hard. I still have some self-worth issues as a result of it. Sometimes I still feel like I don't deserve to be alive or be happy or loved because of those experiences, but as I've gotten older I've gotten better at controlling those feelings and the behaviors that come with them. I've learned to love my body, despite the fact that others don't always love or accept it. I still don't think it's ok for others to judge me based on what I look like, but I also don't need people to be ok with my body any more. It took a lot of work in order to get myself to this point, but I'm much happier than I was when I was younger. And that makes the struggle worth it.

CMV.\n\nOp: It is perhaps the largest fly in the ointment of the left-wing worldview: when persecuted minorities persecute other people, and there's no other reason for it than religion, blind hatred of the other, or some unholy combination of the two. India, a country with almost 200 million Muslims, just re-criminalized gay sex after a soul-crushingly brief window of four years of governmental indifference on the subject. In the vast majority of Muslim countries, sex between men is punished with prison time or death (the record for lesbianism is more mixed). Of the countries that kill men (and boys under 18) for their homosexuality, all espouse Islamist visions of the state. The ones that don't criminalize gay sex (like Turkey and Iraq) often sought Western, secular models of governance and hence adopted a more moderate stance on the state's intrusion into citizens' private lives.\n\nAs a proudly left-wing individual (and a gay man) this situation disturbs me quite intensely. One of my best friends grew up in California in a liberal, suburban atmosphere across the bay from San Francisco itself. Despite our very close friendship, his Muslim views have locked his mind into the position that heterosexuality deserves a higher status in society and has repeatedly expressed indifference toward the crimes against humanity committed against gay men by the governments of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and others. Having grown up and lived in the US all his life, he's a very moderate Muslim in most ways, but the fact that homosexuals still offend him on some level testifies to me that the religion of Islam (by which I mean its texts) must promulgate a rabidly negative view of homosexuality and homosexual love, a view whose presence in Islamic law he does not deny. \n\nI grew up in an American household of extremely integrated secular Jews and had a difficult enough time coming out at the age of sixteen. I can only imagine what it must be like for a gay teenager in rural Iran who is told to deny and rip apart his inner psyche for his whole life, to never reveal his true self to anyone in the world. What a hellish nightmare of an existence it must be for him. I have deep concern that Muslim communities in the West, even after several generations of integration, won't ever accept homosexuality as a natural phenomenon in the human tapestry, that they'll always view it as a problem created by the West, one that only pertains to Western families who suffer from a lack of familial cohesion. Please, I implore you, change my view. I need to know that one day things will get better for these teenagers suffering in silence. My research into even the most moderate strands of Islam has only cemented in my mind the deeply troubling (and just horrifically sad) idea that most Muslims will always view gay men as sinful creatures.\n\nResponse A Author: rawkuts\n\nResponse A: First, I'm sorry you've had to deal with Muslims that wouldn't accept homosexuality. While there are definitely those who are still like that, I think just as it is with the rest of the US, that position is (slowly) changing. I'll offer up some anecdotal evidence and some polling data.\n\n[Pew Research survey](http://www.people-press.org/files/2011/08/muslim-american-report.pdf) from Aug 2011\n\n39% of Muslim Americans believe homosexuality should be accepted by society. That sounds kind of dismal, but in 2007 it was even lower at 27%. So it does look like it's changing for the better. I didn't look up if this change is on par with other religious groups, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were.\n\nAnecdotally, my parents are Muslim and so are many of their friends. I've seen some of their attitudes change over the years from ignorance, to indifference, and in some cases to active support of the gay community.\n\nResponse B Author: McKoijion\n\nResponse B: 1. Western perceptions of homosexuality have changed dramatically in a very short amount of time. The Stonewall riots were less than 50 years ago. Before this recent social movement homosexual were treated poorly here too. Popular opinion can change pretty quickly in the broad scheme of things.\n\n2. Even today, only about [50% of Americans accept homosexuality](http://www.gallup.com/poll/135764/americans-acceptance-gay-relations-crosses-threshold.aspx) and that is considered a surprisingly high number.\n\n3. Islam has become much more conservative and fundamentalist in recent years, but that has not always been the case. For example, the Ottoman Empire, the last truly powerful Muslim empire [decriminalized homosexuality in 1858](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_Islam#Modern_day). Considering that homosexuality was a [felony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy_laws_in_the_United_States#History) in every single state in the United States until 1962 (when only Illinois removed the penalties, a decade before any other state) I think that it is hard to blame people's views on homosexuality on religion instead of society.\n\nI'm not saying that trends in religion don't play a major role in influencing popular opinion on social issues, but to say that any group will *always* believe anything is a bit too strong a statement.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author rawkuts's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I also believe (the more controversial point) that religions nowadays, although less so as organizations but rather by individuals or small groups, attempt to and sometimes succeed in halting scientific progress.\n       Stem cell research and other newer scientific fields are seen by certain religions as heretical and going against their held beliefs. These groups and individuals who attempt to stop research in these areas only stagger growth in these areas, which is utterly pointless, because eventually the research will continue to grow.

In doing so, they found sedimentary layers that they then calculated to have needed much more than 6000 years to produce.\n\nIf religion truly hindered scientific progress, the pyramids would never have been built. The ancient Egyptians were about as religious as you can get. They had deeply-held beliefs on spiritual identity, life, and death. They believed in and worshipped multiple gods and goddesses.

When it was time to get car insurance, I searched for all the car insurance companies I could find on Google, then compared quotes.  I considered every company evenly, regardless of how many adverts of theirs I had seen.\n\n\n2. I will never, ever drink Budweiser, Coors, or Miller simply because I find their constant TV war over which of the three is the best so ridiculous that I have permanently crossed them off my list.  I think it is ridiculous that we are all made to sit and watch these companies fight it out.  I believe, again probably rudely, that anybody who sees a Bud Light commercial and then wants to go drink Bud Light is sort of dumb.\n\n3. Many prescription medication commercials start off with an attempt to relate to the viewer's suffering.  I find this disingenuous, especially with regards to the elderly.  Further, I am not a medical doctor, and I would never try to tell my doctor what medicine he should be prescribing me.  Instead, I would tell her my symptoms, and let her do her job.\n\n\nResponse A Author: caw81\n\nResponse A: \nYou don't need to do that for advertising to work.\n\nIt needs to effect you when you are weak.  So you are inviting people over and want to have a good time with them.  What pop do you get?  Some brand you never heard of or Coke?  \n\nNoticed that you can list of Bud, Coors and Miller off the top of your head (What happened to Heineken?).  Now you are in a restaurant in a social event and the waitress asks you what drink you want and everyone is ordering an alcoholic drink.  Quick, what do you order?  Well, you can list Bud, Coors and Miller right off the top of your head.\n\nFor drug treatment, its for recognizing that there is a treatment for your problem.  Maybe your doctor isn't fixing it to your satisfaction, maybe its something over-the-counter and not doctor worthy (like hair loss).  In any case, its information you store away for when you are weak and it pops up.\n\nResponse B Author: jumpup\n\nResponse B: you know coke and pepsi, now name 3 other cola brands,....  ye thats advertisements power.\n\nlook while of course you feel unaffected, thats because ads don't have as blatant effect as you are hoping for, the effect are much more subtle.\n\nfor example you know the brands of 3 beers that you never intent to drink, but without the add you wouldn't have even known those existed, and if you ever have to chose between foreign brand vs coors you will be more tempted towards the one you knowWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author caw81's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: I have heard many people talk about how students shouldn't wait until the night before an exam to study and I have seen many of my friends study for over ten hours for a single exam. I do not understand why doing this is necessary. The purpose of an exam is to quantify how well students understand material that has already been taught. Everything that an exam covers, the students are expected to already have learned through lectures, reading the book, homework assignments, labs, etc. At the point that a student is studying for an exam, all of the information they need, they should already know. It is my understanding that the purpose of studying is to refresh your memory and recall details about things you learned a month ago that you had since forgotten.

I think those subjects lend themselves well to not having to study much for exams because foundational concepts are taught as the building blocks for more complex material.\n\nIt seems that classes where early information isn't regularly referenced in later material (or logically connected somehow) would take longer to study for, since the material is easier to forget.\n\nResponse B Author: hardcorr\n\nResponse B: As a mathematics and computer science major, I personally study best from doing practice problems over and over until I've sharpened my intuition as well as my working knowledge of how the tools I have learned relate to each other. This process takes much longer than a few hours.\n\nIn abstract mathematics especially, knowing the definitions simply isn't enough to be ready for an exam. You have to know how to attack problems, where hangups and issues can arise, and you're racing against the clock for the entire exam. Without having done practice problems to get me in the zone, I will not be prepared. Yes, all the homework I do over the course of the semester is good practice and helps me learn, but you move away from topics quickly and it's very easy to forget how to use certain definitions and ideas if you haven't touched them for a few months.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author wheretofall's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: The arguments of piracy seem to be between people who pay for games and people who don't, and of those, the people who don't pay for games- the people who pirate their games- mostly seem to raise the argument that they can't afford to, and as far as I can tell most of the people who do pay for their games are more well-off financially.  The arguments between these groups seem to arise from an inability of members of the latter group to comprehend someone simply not having the money to purchase all of their games.  \n\nAlso, the problem of piracy in general seems to primarily be a problem in countries with high rates of poverty, such as the US and other third-world countries.  \n\nErgo, it seems evident that people would purchase video games if they could afford to do so without potentially sacrificing something crucial to their survival/comfort (food, water, shelter, etc.).\n\nNote: I am not saying that no one would pirate games if everyone was wealthy.  Obviously extremes exist, but I do consider that to be a very rare extreme, and I am inviting you to attempt to convince me otherwise.\n\n\nResponse A Author: bin161\n\nResponse A: You are trying to argue that there is an absolute link between poverty and stealing (and in this case, piracy). While they do obviously correlate, it isn't as strongly as you seem to think.\n\n[Here's](http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/WhatTheBagelManSaw.pdf) a very interesting article from *Freakonomics* that sheds some light on this relation. In short, guy delivers millions of bagels and doughnuts to over 140 companies. There is no enforcement for payment, customers simply drop money into a box when they take a bagel. He keeps rigorous data on his operation, and his findings show that \"employees further up the corporate ladder cheat more than those down below\". Executives who can obviously afford a dollar for a bagel and 50 cents for a donut nevertheless refuse to pay, perhaps due to a sense of entitlement.\n\nAnother study, linked in [this Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2013/10/27/whether-rich-or-poor-feeling-deprived-makes-us-steal-more/) shows that a major motivation for stealing, apart from not having enough money or food, is the \"feeling of being deprived\". And being rich or poor has little to do with that.\n\nEven on Reddit and the internet in general, the most common moral justification for piracy seems to be \"I feel you are charging too much, therefore I won't pay you at all\". Do you really think most people who own a $1000+ gaming PC can't afford a $40 game, or those who own similarly priced TVs and home theater systems can't afford to rent a movie for a couple of dollars? People don't think twice about buying a $3-$5 coffee, but still feel justified pirating a $1 Android game. You cannot simply categorize all these people as \"very rare extremes\".\n\nIn short, piracy is more of a cultural problem than a monetary one. I come from a third world country where piracy is the norm. No one, no matter how rich or poor, pays full price for digital goods. It is just the socially accepted thing to do. It is extremely refreshing that over here in the US people actually talk about the issue, and people do save up money to buy a game etc. legally.\n\nFinally, you are forgetting the vast number of people who are ready to pay to watch a movie or TV show, but cannot because no legal options actually exist to do so. You can give me as much money as you like, but if a show I really like just isn't available in my country, I will resort to pirating it. \n\nResponse B Author: CNoitez\n\nResponse B: \nThat's not an argument, it's an excuse. Games are actually far CHEAPER today than in the days before easy online piracy, even comparing just MSRPs. If you factor in things like Steam/Origin/GoG sales, used games, etc. the difference in average cost is incredible. If someone is so poor that they cannot afford to spend $10-$15 on a game, they should probably save up their money for something more important. I'm not saying this in a \"poor people can't have fun\" way, just that they should rethink their priorities.\n\nIt's true that some pirates can't afford to buy the things they do in fact pirate, but that's not the same as saying they can't afford games at all. When you're a major pirate you tend to download a bunch of stuff you would probably never actually buy, and the result is that you consume a ton of content. The problem with arguing \"I can't afford\" is that these games are NOT essential to your life. They definitely don't need to play each AAA release the week it comes out. \n\n\nPiracy occurs wherever there are gamers. Not sure where you found the stats on piracy per country, but it is a worldwide thing. Especially in certain countries where new games cost $100 or more.\n\n\nWhat you should really be wondering is how these incredibly poor folks managed to get a console in the first place. It's evident to me that piracy isn't an economic factor as much as a convenience+utility factor, where the more tech-savvy users decide it is more effective to just pirate games. Sure they can pay, but why should they? \n\nIn fact, it seems to me that the average/rich people are more likely to know about piracy, and are therefore more likely to pirate themselves. Especially when we're talking about PC gamers, who are already (mostly) tech-savvy enough to put together a machine themselves.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author bin161's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Change my view.\n\nOp: It is true what they say: it\u2019s the most wonderful time of the year!\n\nChristmas is, in my mind, the best holiday of all for a million reasons.\nWhether or not you celebrate Christmas as a Christian holiday or as the commercialized regular American holiday version, it is still the best holiday out there.\n\nAs a Catholic Christian, I love Christmas because it celebrates the day Jesus was brought to Earth. I love going to church on Christmas Eve night and singing \u201cJoy to the World\u201d and praising the Lord for sending us our eventual savior. \n\nApart from religion, Christmas to me means \u2018family\u2019, and every year I get to spend time with both sides of my family. I see grandparents and cousins and aunts and uncles that I normally don\u2019t get to see throughout the year. I also get to spend more quality time with my immediate family, which is sometimes hard to do with busy schedules. \n\nTo many people, Christmas is about the presents, and although that shouldn\u2019t be the main point, I would never deny the fact that it is fun receiving gifts from people who are close to you, and vice versa I enjoy giving people I love gifts and seeing their excitement upon opening them. \n\nI love the story behind the commercialized version of Christmas, including Santa Clause and his reindeers and elves. I especially enjoy watching Christmas movies about Santa and all other Christmas movies in general. It has become a tradition for many families to watch Christmas movies each night leading up to the 25th. \n\nChristmas cookies and hot chocolate are also an essential part of Christmas, and I love both making and eating Christmas treats. Any holiday that promotes baked goods is a holiday I support. \n\nI don\u2019t know anyone who doesn't get into the spirit of Christmas when they hear a Christmas song, and I love when radio stations only play Christmas tunes for the holiday. \n\nLastly, I love decorating the Christmas tree and the house with lights and ornaments and wreaths. It creates a magical experience going down the streets and seeing everything lit up against the snow. \n\nI could go on and on, but those are a few of the things I love the most. \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Crayshack\n\nResponse A: Christmas to me has always meant being excluded from society.  I was raised Jewish and did not celebrate Christmas, so everyone making a big deal about Christmas quickly got annoying and felt excluding.  Hearing Christmas songs constantly on the radio, seeing decorations everywhere, and hearing everyone say \"Merry Christmas.\" for a month or two every year is a repetitive reminder of \"This is our thing, not yours.\"  As far as Christmas day itself goes, all it means to me is a day where normal schedules get disrupted and there is nothing fun to do with my new free time because almost everywhere is closed and people are busy.  While it is a stereotype, it is true that I usually end up seeing a movie and eating Chinese food.\n\n\nHello, I don't get the Christmas spirit when I hear the songs on the radio and I hate it when radio stations only play Christmas music.  There has been times when I choose to drive in silence rather than listen to the radio.  I wouldn't mind it if it was just the day of or maybe the week of Christmas, but is usually lasts a month or two and I get sick of it.\n\nOf course, I can't argue against a holiday being the best without suggesting a holiday that is better.  So here are the holidays that I consider distinctly better than Christmas:\n\nFourth of July - Traditionally celebrated by setting things on fire and setting off explosives at the base of your driveway.  A pyro's dream holiday.  From a more spiritual side, I consider our mastery of fire to be the only thing that truly distinguishes humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.  I use the Fourth of July as the day to celebrate this because it is already traditionally celebrated with such a large use of fire.\n\nThanksgiving - This is the holiday that holds for me the same feeling of family that you ascribe to Christmas.  However, it doesn't have the downside of excluding myself and all other non-Christians because it isn't a religious holiday.  I especially like the tradition of opening your home to those that don't have anyone else to celebrate that year.  And having the NFL play all day is nice as well.  Overall, this is the holiday that I think is a great holiday for the broadest range of people.\n\nChanukah - While it is a Jewish holiday, it does have its things that are fun.  The presents part of the tradition is basically the same as Christmas but there is more to the holiday than that.  There is also the week of lighting candles which is fun for a pyro like me.  Seeing a room with 54 candles (9 on each menorah and 1 menorah for each member of my family) burning at the same time is quite beautiful.  There is also the fact that any food fried in oil is a traditional food of the holiday.  The most used food for this is latkes (a potato pancake), but things like donuts and french fries are also considered  traditional foods of the holiday.\n\nSuper Bowl Sunday - Not an official holiday, but something that a large part of the country celebrates anyway.  American football is my favorite sport to watch so the grand championship is a big deal.  It usually involves large groups of friends getting together and enjoying a wide range of snacks while watching some of the greatest athletes in the world.  The game itself was a bit disappointing this year, but overall still a great event (and I liked the implications of the results on the future of the league).\n\nThe World Cup Final - Similar to Super Bowl Sunday, just a sport I like slightly less but on a larger scale and less often.\n\nThe Olympics (especially the opening ceremony) - Similar to the Super Bowl and the World Cup, but with a broad range of athletes of just about every type imaginable.  It also has a large emphasis on the world community and the celebration of multiculturalism.  I love seeing how the host country chooses to show off their culture on the world stage when the get the chance.  You get to see how the country views itself and how they want to be seen.  Also, there are some sports that don't really have another event that is worth watching, so the Olympics is the only time to watch some of these athletes and events.\n\nResponse B Author: z3r0shade\n\nResponse B: \nPlenty of families do this on other times of year, Christmas is not unique in this respect. For example, Thanksgiving or even Chanukah and holidays of other religions. There's nothing about this which is unique to Christmas.\n\n\nAgain, this is not unique to Christmas.\n\n\nMany people hate this and highly dislike it and see it as a bastardization of Christmas and while some families have this tradition many do not. This is more of a personal preference than anything else.\n\n\nAs someone who doesn't celebrate Christmas, I find the complete and total saturation of Christmas over everything (tv, radio, decorations) for the entire month of december (and fast encroaching on the end of November) to be annoying as hell. Particularly because there are several other holidays of other religions which happen during the same time of year but these are all ignored in favor of Christmas. Growing up Jewish, it sucked because almost no one puts up Chanukah decorations except for some on jewish households. You don't see stores with Happy Chanukah signs, but see Merry Christmas everywhere. It's very alienating. Hearing a Christmas song brings up these feelings of alienation for me rather than any sort of \"Christmas Spirit\" which is simply again labeling a general concept of goodwill and gift giving as \"christmas\" rather than recognizing it as relevant to many holidays.\n\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's possible to change your view as this is entirely a personal preference. Nothing you've put here is any objective reason for how Christmas is \"the best holiday\". Everything you've stated is only true for a subset of people and there are plenty of people who would disagree with it. Can you give any *objective* reason for why Christmas is the best holiday?Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Crayshack's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I do not mean for this to be attacking the belief that theft and stealing is wrong.\n\nAnyways, I see and hear many people who claim these and similar beliefs arguing that taxes are morally right. For example, the ten commandments includes \"Don't steal\", and the rest of the bible has no exception for taxes (\"give to Caesar\" is for the taxee, not the taxer.

In terms of morals, if you don't pay your taxes, you then need to avoid using anything that is paid for by taxes or the public. If the government would then tax you anyways, then yes I suppose that would be theft.\n\nHowever, such a circumstance is an impossibility in the modern world- you were of course not asked to be born, or if you wanted to grow up within a social structure, but what is the alternative?\n\nResponse B Author: r3m0t\n\nResponse B: \nThe commandments aren't absolute, for example there's a commandment to obey your parents, but this doesn't apply if they're commanding you to do something morally wrong.

CMV.\n\nOp: I think of sandwich as having many vestigial definitions that don't matter very much but nonetheless apply. The following things are in the blanket category of \"sandwich.\" Sandwiches are handheld foods featuring some kind of bread and filling. If an open-faced sandwich is still a sandwich, then how is a pizza dough covered in sauce and cheese not also a sandwich? \n\n* taco\n* pizza\n* gyro\n* wrap\n* some burritos (unless they can no longer be picked up prior to being served)\n* hot dog on buns.\n\nMy girlfriend is disgusted by this opinion but that's just how I see the world. \n\n\nResponse A Author: xiipaoc\n\nResponse A: A hot dog on a bun is *absolutely* a sandwich.  You'd have to be insane to not consider that a sandwich.  It's stuff inside bread.  How is that not a sandwich?\n\nBut when you get to pizza, tacos, and burritos, I think your categorization breaks down a bit.  First of all, I've had sandwiches that fall apart such that I have to eat them with fork and knife.  I pretty much always eat pizza with fork and knife, I don't care what Jon Stewart says.  Donald Trump is wrong about many things, but sometimes you just don't want to make a huge mess.  At least I don't eat sushi that way -- is sushi a sandwich too?  My mom eats sushi with a fork.  I find it disgusting.  Use chopsticks.  (Actually, I knew a guy who ate *pizza* with chopsticks, which is insane.)  Use your hands.  A fork?  Ridiculous.  Anyway.\n\nI think an open-faced sandwich isn't a sandwich.  It's bread with some stuff on it.  It's no more a sandwich than soup in a bread bowl, or bread dipped in truffle oil (that was lunch today, yummy).  To be a sandwich, stuff has to be *inside* bread, either in a split bun of some sort or between two pieces of bread.  In a pita sandwich, there are two pieces of bread that happen to be connected on the edges.  In a bun, there are two halves of the bread that are either connected on one edge or not.  A sandwich cross-section is always bread-stuff-bread.  In fact, \"sandwiched\" refers to something being between two other things, usually tightly.  You can have cracker sandwiches or cookie sandwiches, where you use crackers or cookies instead of bread.  You can have ice cream sandwiches.  But you absolutely need the layers.  If an open-faced sandwich is a sandwich, so is a pizza, but an open-faced sandwich is not a sandwich.\n\nNow, an open-faced sandwich *can* be a \"sandwich\", in quotes.  This is because it can share many characteristics with common *real* sandwiches that are known as such, and it can be treated like a sandwich even though it technically isn't one.\n\nBy the way, *not* sandwiches?  Pork buns.  Melon buns.  Taro buns.  Calzones.  Twinkies.  Dumplings.  Ravioli.  Anything that's bread with some filling *inside* isn't a sandwich.  It's a fine line between pita and calzones, it's true, and that has more to do with pita being honest-to-goodness bread than anything.  A pita sandwich is still stuff inside two slices, though.  A pork bun isn't.  It's got the wrong shape, and the filling is too 3D.  A proper sandwich has layers in hydrostatic equilibrium.  (Just kidding about that last part.)  There's a bottom layer of bread, and there are other layers until the top layer of also bread.  Sandwich making is an art, and sandwich toppings do not commute!  Woe to you if you put the cheese at the bottom, next to the bread!\n\nTacos and burritos are another story.  I would argue that a taco or a burrito is a \"tortilla sandwich\" but not actually a sandwich, just like sushi is a \"rice and seaweed sandwich\" but not actually a sandwich.  I want some sushi now, damn it.  But it's 4:30 AM, and it's cold outside so I don't feel like walking 5 minutes to the 24-hour supermarket to get some day-cold supermarket sushi...  Or do I?  ...I do not.  But are tacos and burritos sandwiches?  It depends on whether you call tortillas bread.  Same with moo shi, and that Vietnamese thing I had once where you soak the white sheets in warm water (the waitress had to show me; I had no idea that dish would be so much work).  I don't think tortillas are really bread, so they aren't really sandwiches, but they're sandwich-like, like ice cream sandwiches.\n\nPizza is only a sandwich if you fold it in half.\n\nResponse B Author: gingerkid1234\n\nResponse B: Personally, I'd only call stuff-between-two-pieces-of-bread a sandwich without any qualifiers.  I'd agree that a gyro or hot dog is a type of sandwich, but if someone asked me what I was eating and I was having a gyro, I wouldn't answer \"sandwich\".  The other issue I have with that list is hard-shell tacos.  I really don't think a hard shell counts as \"bread\".  I mean, it's not bread-y at all.\n\nBut a pizza is wildly different.  The main difference is that you put the stuff on, then bake the bread.  The bread part of the pizza never exists independently of the pizza itself.  You're not taking bread and putting stuff on it like a sandwich.  You have a pizza (just uncooked) before the bread has even been made.  That's the key point--you say it \"features some kind of bread and filling\".  But pizza dough covered in sauce and cheese isn't bread, it's dough.  The sandwiching happens before the bread is made, which makes it a totally separate thing.  Sandwiches are when you put some stuff on bread, not when you put some stuff on dough which is then made into bread.\n\nAdditionally, you called the stuff that goes on the sandwich \"filling\".  I agree.  Usually, in a sandwich, the bread holds or contains the rest of the sandwich, either by bracketing it (a roll), surrounding it (a wrap), or supporting it (an open-faced sandwich).  While pizza is close to the third, I don't think that it's really accurate to say that the bread supports the cheese and sauce--they're all baked together into one unit.\n\ntl;dr sandwiches are where you put stuff on bread.  but in a pizza, the stuff is put on dough and baked with it, which is unlike how a sandwich is made.  also, the cheese and sauce isn't \"filling\".Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author xiipaoc's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Can't beat the boss? Fight the same enemy 100 times and you can. Can't beat these enemies? Go a few screens back and fight the enemies there 100 times until you're strong enough to proceed. Most RPGs can get away with this by having some major strategy in the battle system, or wonderful storytelling. The closest thing Pokemon has to this is its type weaknesses, most of which are obvious (Fire is weak to water). Even the ones that aren't obvious can only be discovered by trial and error and still don't add a huge amount of strategy to the game.\n\nImagine a new player about to reach Giovanni for the first time in the last gym. \"Oh, the next boss uses ground Pokemon? Let me just throw everything at it until I see what they're weak to. Water and grass? Let me fight the same Pokemon 100 times until I'm strong enough to fight them and win.\" The best case scenario without grinding is to hope the RNG is on your side, which still seems like incredibly boring gameplay.\n\n\nGranted, mikalaranda already changed my view (so soon), so unless you have something new to add I suggest you look at his response. It was perfect, I think.\n\n\nResponse A Author: mikalaranda\n\nResponse A: I agree with you: I wouldn't say that the battle system or the storytelling are the selling points of Pokemon. Battles are fun and the stories can be entertaining, but I personally wouldn't argue that these are what have led the series to its immense, international popularity. \n\nI would say some of the strongest points of the series are the following:\n\n* The joys and wonders of finding new Pokemon: This appeals to so many things that people find enjoyable: adventure, discovery, exploration, collecting. Even after having encountered all the species of Pokemon that exist in the game, people still have fun searching for Pokemon with certain stats. attributes, genders, or colors. Because of how rare and difficult to obtain some of these Pokemon are, trainers always have new adventures that they get to undertake in the form of hunting these more elusive creatures.\n* Virtual Pets: Unlike other RPG's where you are taking control of humans, in Pokemon you get to control a team of cool, cute, funny, lovable monsters! Pokemon, in a sense, gives you the opportunity to have those dogs, cats, birds, and hamsters that you've always wanted, but never had because either your parents wouldn't let you, you don't want to put up with the hassle of taking care of them, or you just don't trust yourself with a real living creature. Except in Pokemon, those pets breath fire, shoot streams of pressurized water, and hurl bolts of lightning at each other, all at your command.\n\nSo I would just say that it isn't valid to say Pokemon has no appeal because it is lacking in what are admittedly its weakest aspects. Every game is lacking in some way or another, but what makes it fun is how well its strong points make up for this.\n\nResponse B Author: McKoijion\n\nResponse B: Grinding and strategy aside, Pokemon was an insanely addicting and fun game. It's appeal wasn't just that it was a great game, but that it was a blockbuster experience.\n\n1. Popularity. Almost every kid in school played it. You could trade with them, and battle against them, and best of all, you could talk shop with them. It was an easy way to make friends.\n\n2. Pacing. The game was set up such that you were always just good enough to beat the next boss by the time you faced them. This meant that you didn't have to outright grind to beat bosses, but that you weren't too good either. This kept the focus on strategy instead of grinding. It was a simple strategy, but hey, I was in elementary school.\n\n3. The game had the achievable, but still difficult goal of collecting every single Pokemon. Combined with the main story, this game could take people 50-100 hours of straight gameplay to beat. The battles weren't even the main part of the game. It was more about beating puzzles and collecting Pokemon, which made grinding and boss battles less important. By the end, I would often use \"repel\" just to avoid fighting random Pokemon (aka grinding) so that I could continue the puzzles and hunt for new Pokemon.\n\n4. The game featured extremely addicting elements. This included the fun of raising adorable virtual pets (the game came out shortly after the Tamagotchi phenomenon.) It also included the element of chance. Finding Pokemon was often random, but was totally doable if you invested enough time. Every single Pokemon fight offered a chance to catch something new (at least until you found out what the Pokemon was.) It activated the same neural pathways as gambling in a casino. Hell, the game even featured a virtual token casino. If you add in a compelling story, and the drive to \"catch 'em all, you basically end up with crack for ten year olds.\n\n3. It was a cultural phenomenon. The story was great, and it was supported by TV shows, movies, and a ton of additional media such as playing cards. There were tons of magazine covers and articles devoted to the Pokemon fad. The game was a big deal, and it felt like it.\n\nPersonally, I don't really see the appeal of playing Pokemon anymore, but I am way to old to be a part of their target audience. I still have a ton of nostalgia for Red and Blue though. That being said, while the initial hype has died down, the game has somehow stuck around. People still play them and have fun. Overall, Red and Blue were two of the best games I've ever played, and I think that even if people found the grinding and battle strategy a bit annoying sometimes, the rest of the game more than made up for it.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author mikalaranda's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I do however think that anyone who signs up for the type of work police officers do has to be more than just okay with the possibility of violence.  I think somewhere in their hearts they want to hurt the bad guy for the greater good.  I simply don't buy the argument that they never want to have to be violent, but (sigh) circumstances being what they are call for it.  \n\nViolence is a major tool in their trade, but they're not allowed to say that is it one of the many reasons they signed up to be an officer.   Let me reiterate that I do not hate cops and am quite happy I live a country with a strong and mostly non corrupt police force.  I just think they like the idea of being violent for the state.\n\nResponse A Author: justalittlebitmore\n\nResponse A: Firstly, this is an answer from the UK, I really don't want 100 replies from Americans countering this with US police anecdotal evidence. Our legal and policing systems are very different and really cannot be compared.\n\nI don't understand your point, because their job involves reacting to violence, they must secretly love doling it out? Every police officer I've known has been super kind, and far and away more gentle than anyone else I know. You don't get into the police force for a violent kick (anomalies aside), you do it because you want to make a difference. Most people are policemen and women in SPITE of violence, not because of it; they'd like nothing more than to be redundant in their anti-violence role in society.\n\nYou seem to have the idea that all police officers are just itching for a chance to get their hittin' stick out, barely concealing gleeful grins when a drunk piece of shit starts screaming obscenities. This couldn't be further from the truth in my experience.\n\nResponse B Author: bucketpl0x\n\nResponse B: Some people go into it because they lived in fear at one point in time and looked up to those who protected others. Maybe they became a police officer so that they can serve and protect others who were in a situation they were in before. Another possibility is they don't think their are enough good cops out there and that they would like to change that.\n\nI think the main reason people become cops is so that they can protect others. Not all cops want to be violent or even get in violent situations, you just hear about the ones that do more often. A cop abusing power is something that everyone hears about.

However, I believe these are offset and outnumbered by the tyranny and atrocities committed under non-democratic governments.\n\nWhen I say this I mean that I believe comparing modern and past democracies to modern and past dictatorships and monarchies throughout history will yield the conclusion that the quality of life in a democracy is substantially better for most people and that as more people are given franchise the better and better it gets.  Conversely if, for example, the U.S. had been a one-party dictatorship for the past 200+ years, atrocities such as chattel slavery, genocide of indigenous peoples, and unwarranted global intervention would be that much worse (if imagining such is even possible.)\n\nI want to clarify that I am using the U.S. as my main example because that's where I am, also I think it is a good example of a particularly controversial example of democracy.\n\nI believe that one of the biggest problems with American democracy to date is the ambivelence people have towards democracy.  Judging even just from the posts on this sub many are incredibly disappointed with democracy and will even go as far as to say it is \"obsolete\" or just a bad idea in the first place.  When we stop having faith in democracy we stop having faith in the people and ourselves and necessarily cede our power to others.  \n\nChange my view!\n\n\nOk there have been a lot of requests for me to pin things down better and define my view, I'd say it has changed a little since I first posted but here it is:\n\nDemocracy is any form of government concerned with the idea of giving more people say, more people equality, more people freedom. \n\nSo for example, the U.S. falls short of these things in many ways and at many times but at least it is founded on the premise of expanding the categories that receive citizenship.\n\nAt the founding of the U.S. citizenship was incredibly limited but it was still a far larger category of participants than european monarchy.\n\nSo Democracy is dynamic and you can have moments in the same system/government/culture that are democratic and un-democratic.  \n\nMy belief is the idea that the moments that best represent the will of the people are best for governance overall.\n\n\nOk so far thank you all for a some interesting debates.  This is my first time as OP on CMV so please forgive my amateurish blunders.  After some contemplation and review I have come to the conclusion that my prompt is too ambiguous, that in order to have a fruitful CMV I need to choose specifically what I am defending.  If that is representative democracy, then so be it.\n\nI may have pulled a bit too much of a \"No true Scotsman\" here.\n\n\nResponse A Author: rolldownthewindow\n\nResponse A: Short-term gains over long-term benefits is one of the most striking problems with democracy. Say you get elected in a democratic system and you have a term of four years before the next election. Your goal is to create benefits for your voters that will be seen before the next election so they will re-elect you. Sometimes those short-term benefits may produce long-term costs. I'm talking immediate pork-barrel spending or tax cuts that will blow out the budget down the line. Or approving fracking on government land to create jobs in your electorate with little regard for long-term environmental impacts. That sort of thing. A system like a monarchy where rulers are in power for life might encourage long-term thinking.\n\nPopular vote causes more problems than short-term vs long-term costs and benefits. There's the lowest common denominator factor that often arises when you need to appeal to as many people as possible. Promising your voters' \"goodies\" (such as tax cuts, new spending programs, welfare benefits) is a sure way to get elected. It's not only the politicians but more importantly the voters who think of the short-term benefits of electing one candidate over the other. It would be incredibly difficult to win an election on the platform of reducing benefits for current voters so that 10-20 years later the country will be in better shape.\n\nThe need to win elections also leads to corruption. Funding is often required to help win elections. Some systems have attempted to reduce this problem through public campaign financing or restricting political donations. But it's not as simple as that. Newspapers can play a large role in promoting a candidate. And if the owners of that newspaper also own shares in oil companies, you might get their endorsement by promising more drilling contracts. Unions can also endorse certain candidates, and encourage their members to vote a certain way. So restricting (legal) donations doesn't solve all corruption.\n\nDemocracy is also not the best system depending on the current state of a country. If a country is in complete disarray a benevolent dictatorship might actually be better for a transitionary period. Democracies are slow. Acts of government need to be voted on by (usually) two houses of parliament/congress and then signed into law by an executive. That's a long process that begins with a politicians (or several) drafting a bill, getting sponsors and co-sponsors, getting support for the bill, putting it up for a vote, negotiating amendments, putting it up for another vote, etc. That's not ideal is a crisis situation. Which doesn't mean, by the way, that the country has to be in a complete state of chaos. A functioning democracy could be hit with a crisis (e.g. an economic/financial crisis), in which case the democratic process becomes a hinderance. In the case of an economic crisis, by the time a democratic governments gets around the recognising the problem, drafting a response, appeasing all sides, voting on a response, approving the response, the crisis has either resolved itself or become worse (in which case the governmental response is too little, too late).\n\nAfter all that democracy may still seem the best system. Communism didn't work. Fascism was horrible. As far as twentieth-century totalitarianism goes, we definitely don't want that again. However, there were \"better\" forms of dictatorship in the past. Enlightened Absolutism, the Florentine Republic. It also doesn't have to be about democracy versus dictatorship. You could go the other way, to some form of \"anarchist\" or non-statist system of organising society. I may not have convinced you that democracy isn't the best system - I'm not convinced myself - but I hope that you at least consider the possible that there is a better way (maybe no-one has theorised it yet) of organising society than modern democracy. Democracy can't be as good as it gets.\n\nResponse B Author: Fimmschig\n\nResponse B: In the wider sense, politics is concerned not only with the specific question of how and why government positions should be filled with whom, but with the more general questions of how power and resources should be distributed in all areas of society, and how collective decisions should be made. The degree to which a state is actually able to represent the interests of the electorate depends upon how much power that state has in relation to other coexistent systems of power. If you define democracy simply as representative government, this hides the fact that the actual distribution of power and resources could still be completely skewed. If the government is small, limited and only concerned with protecting basic rights, the individual citizen vote is actually quite worthless. In particular, resources in current democracies are allocated primarily through a capitalist system of unlimited private ownership and free trade. These private institutions are completely unelected and unaccountable despite having substantial power over society and culture. At that point the door is wide open for government corruption because systems of private power dominate society and easily manipulate government policy for their interests.\n\nI think you are putting way too much focus on the question of how government should be organized, without considering the wider social question of who runs society in reality, rather than on paper. The US is widely considered a plutocracy, not a democracy, because the abstract structure of the government is quite irrelevant compared to what and whom that structure is filled with. What really matters is what the society and its culture look like, what its values are, how people are educated, how people evaluate politicians, what people think society ought to look like in the future, and the question of whether politicians have an authentic motivation to act in the interest of all of society. The election process doesn't start with the election, it starts 40 years prior with the question of who gets education, who climbs the ranks of a political party, who gains a reputation according to local social standards.\n\nThe principle argument against democracy rests on this understanding that it doesn't matter whether a society's government is democratic or controlled by a one-party state, because a society that likes having slaves, conquering soil or oppressing women is not going to elect somebody who's opposed to these things out of nowhere. Likewise, a democratic state is of very limited use if real power is found elsewhere. Other systems of government could be far better for a given society, because the economic system, the culture and the political class could be completely different. Unelected governments, for example, are perfectly fine if the processes through which people enter the government serve the interests of the people. That is a very specific question of the specific people who operate that government, and the processes by which people can get into positions of power within it. If there are laws and regulations that effectively ensure that only dedicated people with great social responsibility are accepted, this will work nicely. This isn't any different from the way \"democratic\" political parties work, nor is it different from how private corporations work. One party is really only one party less than two, it can be a fantastic system if it's a decent society where meaningful power is equally distributed among citizens, and not primarily in the hands of the state or private institutions. Such a party could do public polling to influence policy, and actually put it into practice because they care. Democratic parties do public polling too, but they rarely care about putting anything into practice - hey almost like a one-party state!Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author rolldownthewindow's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

If you aren't a great speller get somebody to spellcheck it for you. It's amazing that 80% of the resumes that I've reviewed have a spelling mistake, grammar mistake (i.e. mixing tenses), or punctual mistake.\n\nThis is not a position that requires a great deal of writing. It is a retail sales associate position for a cellular phone store, but attention to detail is pretty important ~~to me~~ for this position. If you are trying to impress a potential employer and you make a mistake that is easily avoided, such as spelling or grammar, how can you be trusted with a customer every day when you have to think on the fly? CMV\n\n\nI also see many people saying that detail-oriented people are not necessarily good sales people and vice versa. This is true, but for this job specifically there is a lot of paperwork, promotions, and details in which a small mistake can be costly. My original post didn't really convey that, and that lead to a lot of assumptions.  That was my fault for being ambiguous in this specific position.  \n\nHaving said that, for those of you that say one small mistake should not automatically disqualify a candidate because I could lose some great potential employees, I might be able to be talked into that just because I don't want to lose a potential good employee. However, it still doesn't change the fact that this is not a pop quiz. You have all the time in the world to make it perfect. I think people are missing my point. I'm not penalizing someone for not being good at spelling or using proper grammar. I'm penalizing them for not getting help to correct it. I have used the term detail-oriented, but perhaps professionalism might have fit better.  You don't have to have a great grasp of the the English language to get help from someone that does.\n\nSome have said that not everyone has someone to proof-read his resume. To me that is a poor excuse. Teachers, former teachers, friends, family, or coworkers could do that. You don't necessarily have to have a highly qualified person to catch a simple mistake. If that's not an option, there are online resources. I think most of these mistakes are out of laziness to have someone else look over his resume.  \n\n\n\nI'd also like to add that I once ignored a resume with more than one spelling error and very poor formatting. He later came into the store to inquire about his resume. I gave him an interview on the spot because even though he made some avoidable mistakes, he took the time to follow up and inquire. This is important in this position because in a sense, he corrected his own mistake. Not literally by editing the resume, but he gained back my confidence by essentially saying, \"Was my resume to your satisfaction? Is there anything else I can do to get an interview?\" So I guess I'd like to amend my CMV to \"I won't hire someone with a misspelling on his resume... unless he redeems himself in some way or I have a shallow pool to pick from and I have to choose someone\"  (That's kind of a wordy title though)\n\n\n\nFor those of you that took the time to respectfully write well thought out ideas to change my view, I thank you. I think I read almost every single reply of the 400 or so comments. I'm sorry I couldn't reply to every single one, but I did try to reply to as many as I could. I found the whole process very educational and entertaining. This was my first time doing one of these and I learned a lot. For the very few that resorted to blame, cursing, or name-calling, grow up.\n\nResponse A Author: Glory2Hypnotoad\n\nResponse A: The problem is that, as a general rule, we all consider ourselves good judges of character even when there's no real basis for that belief. It's intuitively satisfying to believe that you can know what a small, isolated mistake tells you about a person, but that doesn't mean that it's true.\n\nResponse B Author: jayjay091\n\nResponse B: It depends what you are looking for. \n\nIf most of the resume you go through belong to people who would do an \"ok\" job and you are not looking for a very specific skill set, then sure, you can remove people for small mistakes, you'll end up with someone good enough for you anyway, and it will make the process faster. It is the basically the same as doing \"I remove the top 50% of the stack of resume, I don't want to hire unlucky people\". It works, as long as you are not too picky.\n\nHowever, if only 0.1% of the resume you read even come close to the person you are looking for, then you can't simply remove people for a simple spelling error. If you do that, you'll most likely remove the (very rare) person you are looking for.\n\nYou are probably thinking that if this person was that good and that skilled, he wouldn't have made a mistake in the first place ? Actually, it is most likely the opposite. This person hasn't been out of a job for long, he has probably sent a resume to many companies and most of those would be lucky to get him. He is not going to spend hours checking for mistakes on each letter. He doesn't care enough, because he'll get a job eventually (but YOU should care about getting him instead of other companies).\n\n Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Glory2Hypnotoad's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Feel free to be hostile if I am blatantly wrong.  \n\nResponse A Author: OmegaTheta\n\nResponse A: I don't think fat shaming is the way to go. While I agree with you that 99% of the time, it's within your control if you're overweight or not, there is a difference between obesity and, say, not showering.\n\nFor example, consider this: When I was in the military, we had this guy in one of my platoons who would not shower. Living in the barracks, we all suffered but particularly his roommates. Eventually, some of the guys in my platoon decided they had had enough and they \"fixed\" his problem. It was not a pleasant experience for anyone, particularly him. But, after that, he showered everyday. Problem solved. Maybe it wasn't right that he was shamed (and borderline assaulted) but it worked.\n\nWe also had some fatties. There was no dragging them to the back of the barracks and spraying them with a skinny hose. It was a much more long term problem and while it may have been their fault, it's a much harder problem to fix. While some fat people might respond well to being shamed into exercising and eating better, a lot of them won't. That kind of treatment will really just perpetuate their problem and make it harder to deal with.\n\nOn another note, you didn't mention anything about age. I assume you're referring strictly to adults but on the off chance you aren't, kids don't need any more bullying and a lot of them really aren't in a position to change their diets or activity level. Parent shaming (who are most likely also fat) would be a more defensible position.\n\n**TL;DR**: Not showering or wearing deodorant? Easy, immediate fix. Anyone who doesn't do it doesn't respect the people around them.  Being overweight is a much harder obstacle to tackle. If there's any lack of respect, it's not for other people, it's for themselves. Overweight people need encouragement (and maybe even pity) to get in shape. They don't need, nor would it help, if all they get is humiliation or bullying. \n\nResponse B Author: doctor_sharkee\n\nResponse B: I have been on the border of overweight/obese for much of my life. I've also cut myself down to 'very fit' multiple times in my life. As a guy in his mid-thirties, my metabolism has slowed down dramatically, and it has become harder and harder to cut fat or even just maintain my weight.\n\nBUT\n\nWhen people say that they just 'cannot' lose weight no matter how much they exercise or how healthy they eat, they are just lying. It takes monumental effort for me to maintain my size and shape, but I put in that effort. I make sacrifices in food intake. I refuse free food at work constantly because I know that I can't afford to eat it.\n\nI spend literally 6 hours a week at a boxing gym and do 1-2 hours a week of additional physical activity. I have a desk job and can't do any physical activity at work. This means that my 7-8 hours a week of exercise comes during my free time. \n\nThe point I'm making is that as adults, people have choices to make. It's not like information regarding food choices is hard to come by. So people just need to eat appropriately and exercise an amount that actually will make a difference.

CMV\n\nOp: I am a Canadian, and as America is my close neighbor, have taken notice to their restriction on Communism, with (for example) Cuba and North Korea currently, as well as the U.S.S.R. I feel that communism is not as bad as America make it seem. A society where everyone is equal seems great to me, as it removes some of the basic faults in society, such as poverty, homelessness, joblessness, as well as touching on moral values such as greed, and envy. I believe a proper Communist society (I.E. one that is not a dictatorship like Joseph Stalin or Fidel Castro) would be beneficial. I could easily be very wrong with my view, but i feel that what i see could definitely work, so Change My View.\n\nResponse A Author: RexReaver\n\nResponse A: \nThat's one of the big problems with communism - what is equality? Is everyone equal? Although I believe every human deserves equality in respect and dignity I don't believe everyone is equal. Will women receive the same opportunities in life as a man? Does a man with locked in-syndrome have the same opportunities as an Olympic athlete? Is it fair you may have a prettier wife than me? Life is unfair and financial equality is not the final answer.  \n\n\nYes there are problems within society but this doesn't mean there is a fault with society. Joblessness is just the growing pains of a changing society. With globalization and increase in women in work, there is much more people looking work than there was 60 years ago. We have always judged men on their ability to work now this has passed on to women and teenagers. Women who have children and do not work are stigmatized where as they were stigmatized if they did work 60 years ago. We pressure everyone in a family to be employed when one employed family member would suffice. Now I'm not saying women and teenagers should not work, I\u2019m just saying the world is still adapting to this.\n\nHomelessness and poverty can be tackled through welfare reforms. Universal healthcare, free education, social care and strong welfare system can address these problems without the need for reformation of the system. To show this is working all we have to do is look back 100 years ago where one of the biggest health problems in the western world was malnutrition whereas now it is obesity.\n\n\nThis is another big problem for communism; it doesn't take human nature into consideration. Sure people can be generous and thoughtful but they are also greedy, envious and selfish whether we see it or not. It is human instinct to put our own interests first. Many could help poverty right now by giving their disposable income to charity but they don\u2019t. Communism too heavily depends on people doing the best for everyone else and when they don\u2019t communism cannot function.\n\n\nfurthermore, it is unlikely we could ever get a true communist society due to human nature. When you place a man in charge of a one party government which controls the means of production it\u2019s quite difficult to restrain him from going power mad.  There is also the issue of the definition of a true communist society.\n\nThe communist manifesto reads a lot like a religious doctrine. It over simplifies complex subjects such as politics, history, criminology and economics then generalises the specifics, which leaves it open to individual interpretation. Stalin\u2019s idea of communism was different to Lenin as was Castro\u2019s to Mao\u2019s and each of them found it imperative to supress individuality and human expression. \nThis is why the majority of communist states enacted a one party system. If the individual was allowed to express their ideas then they could find like-minded people, form an assembly then eventually a political party which could replace the communist state. In any given society there will always be people, who want to express their ideas, better their life\u2019s and extend their liberties, so a democratic communist state would defiantly find political opposition.  In order to sustain a communist state you would have to revoke democracy and quash freedom of expression, therefore the smallest minority, the individual, would lose it rights and the state would determine what we needed and distribute it accordingly. \nThis then leads to the inequality of equality. If distribution was based on need, then people would   lose the incentive to improve themselves. If a rocket scientist received the same as a bin man what would be the point in wasting years training to be a rocket scientist? As all property would be owned by state the only way you could improve your life would be through the state. This would in turn lead to nepotism and put a restraint on human ambition and creativity. Entrepreneurs could no longer develop their own company, create art, make movies or write their own novels.  Could you imagine a world without Apple, McDonalds or Coca Cola?  Would you trade it all to stand for hours in a bread line? \nOverall, I believe communism is not the answer simply because people like to own things. Whether it\u2019s their acres of land, their house, their car or the shirt on their back, people will always want their own property.  Giving up our property, our democratic system and our liberties is not the solution for society\u2019s problems, a capitalist economy with socialist aspects that promotes free education universal healthcare, social care and a strong welfare system would help towards our goal of reducing society\u2019s ailments. \n\nResponse B Author: bin161\n\nResponse B: Firstly, if you haven't done so already, I'd highly recommend reading *Animal Farm* by George Orwell. It is an allegory of the Russian Revolution that describes exactly why the idea of \"everyone is equal\" never works.\n\nCommunism always has and always will eventually lead to political repression, personality cults, loss of basic freedoms and inhibited economic and social development. There are enough examples throughout recent history that support this claim. \n\nSure, you could argue for a \"perfect\" communist state that wouldn't face these problems. But in theory, a perfect dictatorship would work just as well, so would perfect anarchy. While communism sounds good in theory, so does every other philosophy anyone has ever dreamed of. \n\nThe bottom line is, you cannot suppress basic human desires. It is in our nature to want \"more\". Capitalism incentives this desire, while communism crushes it. In communism, it is only the political class that has the means to get more, while most of society is living devoid of any incentive to succeed.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author RexReaver's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: I've been watching the news lately, and there have been a lot of murder trials where the amount of leeway given to judges in terms of sentencing. For example, in [a local case in Minneapolis](http://www.startribune.com/local/east/233333381.html), he was found guilty of \"second degree unintentional murder.\"\n\nMinnesota law defines second-degree unintentional murder as an act causing the death of \u201ca human being, without intent to effect the death of any person, while committing or attempting to commit a felony offense other than criminal sexual conduct in the first or second degree with force or violence or a drive-by shooting \u2026\u201d\n\nI think this is rediculous. If someone kills someone by beating them to death \"without meaning to\", what difference does it make? They killed someone, and I don't think that there should be a difference whether it was premeditated to kill a specific person, if you plan to kill someone but not a specific person (gang violence), or you kill someone on a spur of the moment. Barring extenuating circumstances like self defense, I believe that if you murder someone, motives shouldn't be taken into account even if you \"accidentally\" beat someone to death. CMV.\n\n\nI have to also have to say that while I may think that self-defense isn't murder, if you completely disregard intent, then it is a flawed argument on my part. As many of you have pointed out, the different degrees of the crime are ways of making sure that those who murdered someone get at least some sort of justice. I also have to thank /u/learhpa for pointing out that in order for something to be considered a crime, you have to have a \"criminal intent\" towards this. \n\nI'm going to go through everyone's arguments and respond/award deltas for those who gave me a different perspective and at least changed part of my viewpoint on this. \n\nLast of all, I just have to say I really enjoy this sub. It's one of the few places on reddit where there are actual civil discussions on things, and I really appreciate those who took the time to respond. \n\nResponse A Author: uniptf\n\nResponse A: You have confused motive and intent.\n\nIntent is the mental process of meaning to cause the death that you cause.  that is one of two things considered in determining if a person committed a crime or not, and which one.\n\nMotive is the 'reason' that the offender committed the crime.  Person A murdered person B because B slept with A's wife.  That is not considered in determining what crime was committed or in determining guilt or innocence.  It's only discussed/presented at trial because it helps juries see the whole picture of the crime and understand what happened, and might be able to be used to show aggravating or mitigating circumstances at sentencing.\n\nMotive is not an element of the crime, and many trials never discuss motive.  Only the actions that were taken, and the intent of the killer, specifically, did they cause the death willfully, knowingly, and will malice aforethought.\n\nResponse B Author: PepperoniFire\n\nResponse B: It boils down to sentencing, hung juries and a basic sense of justice.  There was a time when the majority of our common law crimes were felonies, and the only sentence for felonies was the death penalty.\n\nOver time, this began to offend peoples' sense of justice.  They would hear cases where someone was killed but the circumstances didn't make it seem very *fair* to give them the death penalty.  So they wouldn't, and people who did something wrong would effectively go unpunished because there were no other, more nuanced options.\n\nA famous example of this was a shipwrecked crew that eventually killed one of their sick shipmates and ate him to survive ([dramatic reenactment.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFDgSKbapzY))  I think we can come up with even more sympathetic cases than that.  These guys killed someone else, and it was by all means wrong, but we also recognize the - as you put it - mitigating circumstances that make this situation fundamentally different from the person who stalks his prey with the malicious intent to brutally kill them at some point in the future.\n\nThis [blog](http://thenaturallawyer.wordpress.com/2009/07/12/regina-v-dudley-stephens-morality-murder-and-the-criminal-law/) has a bit of editorializing (hurr abortion), but I think it touches on a lot of questions the case raises and you can chew on:\n\n\nEmphasis mine.\n\nSo, we began having graded crimes with staggered sentencing that allows juries to consider multiple theories of criminal liability.  It's common for prosecutors to argue for both first degree murder and an alternative then leave it to the jury to decide on what charge, if either, he has met his burden.\n\nIt's basically designed to facilitate criminal convictions by ensuring that juries have the maneuvering room to find someone who has done *something* wrong guilty of a crime without having to sentence him to a grossly disproportionate sentence.  Otherwise, they're inclined to find such a person not guilty, which is bad, because *they* did something bad, and we want there to be some kind of consequence for that, but without that staggered sentencing, our hands are tied.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author uniptf's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Steam is the forefront supplier of PC games, and a company who has integrated demo functionality into their store very well, even going so far as to advertise demos on its storefront, yet only ~10% of games offered demos.

They take very minimal education and labor. They should not be used to support a family, but it is good to have jobs out there to supplement income. They are good jobs for teens or someone in between work. I am tired of the only arguement I get being you don't know how hard they work or the patience it takes to deal with customers. Yes I fucking do, I've worked fast food. Obviously it takes some work, it is a job. My point is it isn't *very* challenging mentally or physically compared with higher paying job.\n\nResponse A Author: shadowcat0204\n\nResponse A: So, right now in the US it seems we have a lot of undereducated people doing minimum-wage jobs that could, with the proper education, do much more skilled jobs. \n\nI am, in principle, agreeing with you. I think that jobs like this should be left to teenagers, robots, and those with disabilities that prevent them from doing more advanced work. It would be much better if all of the capable adults were working more mental tasks than the menial labor type tasks.\n\nThe question then becomes how do we get them there? We have massive unemployment in this country and a large number of people working minimum-wage or near-minimum-wage jobs, not highly-skilled jobs. They simply don't have the skills or qualifications to get higher-paying jobs. So how do we fix it?\n\nWell, for starters, I think that the education system in this country needs to be completely overhauled, so that everyone is getting a good education. If all of our students started pouring out of school getting degrees that will help you get a job (not musical theater, history, etc.) then we would have fewer and fewer people needing to work those minimum wage jobs to support their families with. The main problem, though, is education in this country is getting less and less funding with more and more student debt -- I think we should adopt a European style, where college is free and taxpayers foot the bill.\n\nEven if we were to enact this magical solution tomorrow, though, there'd still be the massive number of people out there right now who can't get a highly-skilled job because they aren't educated. But if they are working minimum-wage jobs trying to feed themselves and their families, how can they possibly find the time to go out and take classes, even if it is free? Personally I'd support the government actually *paying* people to go back to school (as in, not only giving them tuition but paying for their living expenses as well) so that they can just focus on school and their families. But again, this would need the government's support of education.\n\nThe other solution is just straight-up welfare. People who don't make enough money get supplemental money from the government to pay for basic necessities. But welfare is trashed over and over (especially on places like Fox News) and the people who are currently on welfare are seen as moochers.\n\nI guess here's my main point. People who are working minimum wage jobs right now don't WANT to be doing that. That's not their life goal. The problem is, we haven't given them any way to achieve that! They probably got a crappy education and have no way to afford to go back to school to get a better education. At least by raising the minimum wage, we could give them a big help up to paying off their debts and working on a better life for themselves, even if that means not going to school themselves and just sending their children to school. If you have a different solution for helping people get out of poverty, then by all means let's hear it, but we have to do SOMETHING! \n\nResponse B Author: spades593\n\nResponse B: The problem isn't how hard the work is, or how skilled the people need to be. The problem is the number of jobs. People who are more than qualified to do a lot more than work in customer service or labor industries, are pushed out of higher income brackets due to the influx of people, and lack of growing jobs. These people need that job to be a living, because people much more than qualified are taking the jobs they traditionally would have held. Its the reason teenage employment is down so badly. They are the bottom of that pile being pushed out by middle aged people who need to hold multiple kinds of these jobs to support a family, who in the past wouldn't have even needed to apply.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author shadowcat0204's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

But people who become deaf later in life *are* used to hearing, so at the very least they should not be allowed to drive. And this same logic could be applied to say that blind people should be allowed to drive, or that \"I always wear headphones while driving\" should be a valid excuse.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: aardvarkious\n\nResponse A: It is all a cost benefit allowance. Yes, deaf people *may* have a *slightly* higher risk of causing accidents (but without statistics, that is a big maybe and the risk must be negligible if it exists). The question is, is the risk big enough to justify banning people from driving? Is the cost of banning them outweighed by the benefit? It is obvious the cost of banning them. But you haven't provided any evidence (just suppositions) that they are a danger and so there is an benefit to banning them. \n\nI am curious: why are you picking on the deaf? \n\nPeople with glasses can get glare or dirty glasses. They are slightly less able to see than those without. Should they be banned from driving? \n\nPeople who had lasik eye surgery may have slightly worse night vision than those without. Should they be banned? \nShort people can't see around as well as tall people. Although a tall person crammed into a driver's seat has limitations too. Should we put minimum and maximum height requirements in? \n\nVerifiable statistics show that men are more likely to have serious accidents than women. Should they be banned from driving? \n\nIf it have a cold I am not as aware as if I am completely healthy.

We are not only going to let perfect people drive. For each type of thing we ban in drivers, we need to judge if it is worth it or not. We should do so with statistics.

It's no different from all the bad reasons why a hearing person might take their hands off the wheel or their eyes off the road.\n\n\nThe same could be said of drivers who speak a foreign language, yet we allow them to drive.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author aardvarkious's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

In another CMV post I was convinced otherwise. Here's my attempt at a crystal clear description of my view and why:\n\nCivilians should be allowed to own explosives. If it were allowed I would want to see laws that place the liability of damage done with said explosives on the owner or individual that used the device. Explosives should not be allowed for use in self-defense against other persons. The process for purchasing explosives should be the same as it is for purchasing hand guns (which usually requires that you be a bit older than for shotguns, long guns, etc.) however registration should NOT be required. I'm still on the fence as to whether or not some kind of training and/or additional licensing should be required prior to being allowed to purchase. This is all assuming that we are not in a state of civil war, revolution, etc. at which point it wouldn't really matter what the laws are, no one would care to follow them.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* First and foremost the second amendment is intended to allow civilians to prevent a tyrannical government. As such, it's my opinion that civilians should be allowed to purchase and own any tools required to do so. Police forces across the country now own APC's and there are many departments who already have or are looking to purchase drones. In the event of a revolution civilians could face any amount of armor up to and including armored Humvees and tanks.\n\n* Criminals that want to use explosive devices will build explosive devices. There are already several books out there that an individual can read to learn how to do so and the Internet makes them easily and anonymously accessible.\n\n* I don't support registration because of incidents like New York where a list of registered owners could be leaked. I think incidents like this put the owner at risk of robbery and make it easier for criminals who may consider the idea of stealing weapons / explosives to obtain them.\n\n* For the same reason as the above point I am on the fence about required training. I'd certainly be more comfortable with my view if I could say that I think people should be required to take a course as it serves a double benefit: people learn how to use the explosives properly (good in case of revolution) and only the people that have learned can buy them (good for public safety) but at the same time this is again a paper trail that can be traced back to owners of explosives that has the potential to be hacked, stolen, distributed, etc.\n\nI will say that I am and always will be an avid supporter of my right to own hand guns, shotguns, and long guns.

One of the reasons the police have armored vehicles is *because* the civilians do not have rocket launchers or weaponry that can fight them. \n\nDo you really think the police force is going to say, \"oh no, now that civilians have rockets, they got us good. We're going to *give up* and just stick with and stop at our now-vulnerable APCs?\" \n\nThey won't.\n\nResponse B Author: Sleakne\n\nResponse B: First of all can i clarify that if it were legal you would buy one and have it around your house, just in case.  An AT4 anto tank gun costs $1500.  I'd rather give that to a political party that was against government tyranny...or buy a hot tub.\n\n\nSecond I think we have gone past the point where the citizens of the US could beat the US army in a fight.  Explosives would increase your chances a little but they have drones, bombers, tanks, highly skilled personnel and WMD's.  You would have whatever weapons you stockpiled before the tyrannical government stopped you buying weapons and no training or organisation.\n\nCivilians in Iraq and Afghanistan have been fighting the US army (with explosives) and they haven't been doing very well.

I noticed that, for the majority of words that have alternate pronunciations, I mostly tended toward the British way (i.e: I pronounce the letter Z by itself as \"Zed\")\n\nI find, however, that whenever I use these words most people go out of their way to correct me. I usually try, without too much insistence, to explain that there are different pronunciations for the same word and I say it differently due to my heritage. If they push the issue, I'm happy to concede and change my pronunciation during the rest of the conversation, but I still find their insistence mildly offensive. \n\nI'm aware I'm in a particular country that speaks English a certain way, but to completely discount alternate (and, in many cases, the original) pronunciation as \"wrong\" seems nationalistic at best and conceited at worst. Everyone should be mindful of the culture they are in, and I can see how I might come across as aloof, but I don't do this to be different, I do this because I **am** different, just as anyone from any other nationality is different. It's not an attempt to subvert American pronunciation as \"wrong\", because it is just as right as any other nation's pronunciation. \n\nIf I could just chalk this up to nationalism, I would accept it and move on as just a facet of American culture. However, it feels like it's just aimed at me. If a Canadian was to pronounce about as \"aboot\" the worst that will happen is a few jokes. That is \"ok\", but my situation is apparently \"not ok\". \n\nPlease, change my view.\n\nBecause so many people have asked, here is more information that I should have included in my original post:\n\n* Yes, I have an accent. However, I have found that it is a strange mix of Australian and American pronunciation (most Americans say I sound either British or Australian, and if they think I sound American, I sound like I'm from the northeast, where I've never lived) . Because of this, I always explain my accent in the context of where I grew up (Missouri) and my mother teaching me to speak\n* I grew up using Australian slang, though I often did not learn it was Australian only until much later in life. I have since, for the most part, stopped using the slang because it requires explaining whole new words. My pronunciation, on the other hand, is inherently a part of my accent, and because I have to explain that just about every time I meet someone, in my mind justifies my pronunciation. \n* I do *not* think that the British pronunciation is any more \"right\" than the American, it was a mistake in my part to say it was original. I did not intend sound uninformed or conceited\n* My peers often go out of their way to correct me in a very specific and individual way. They say that, because I'm American and was raised in America, I should sound American. However, I find they are ignoring not only my obvious accent but also the profound effect my mother has has on not only my speech patterns but also the words I use. I often try to identify as *both* Australian and American, because to me that is what I am. When my pronunciation gets confusing, I will happily switch for the conversation. However, when others cannot seem to understand *why* I sound like that and instead attribute it to me attempting to sound \"different\"  is when I take offense. * In a formal environment, I will adhere to the standard (which is  usually American in nature) because that has a very precise meaning of correct\n\nResponse A Author: arcosapphire\n\nResponse A: \nJust to set you on the right path, you're wrong to say \"original\". In fact, *that* is nationalistic and conceited: the idea that modern British pronunciations are somehow older or more legitimate than American ones.\n\nMuch like humans didn't \"come from\" modern apes but are merely another branch sharing a common ancestor, so too with languages. American and British English have both been evolving, in parallel, from the same origin. Neither is older, neither is more legitimate. Furthermore, this is a simplification: there are many commingled offshoots making up each of those dialects.\n\nMost people are quite ignorant about language, and believe the follies of prescriptivism. They believe there *is* a right, better, or more legitimate version of a word--as you yourself implied--and will correct apparent transgressions. This is a normal function of sociolinguistics, which on a local scale ensures intelligibility, and on a larger scale creates divisions.\n\nIt'd be nice, perhaps, if everyone accepted every deviation. But this may lead to increasing problems with mutual intelligibility, and in any case, is not normal social functioning. Humans *don't* work that way, and we know this through the science of sociolinguistics, so it is pointless to hope for change.\n\nResponse B Author: scottevil110\n\nResponse B: My wife is English and has lived in the US for 6 years now.  I \"correct\" her when she pronounces certain words the British way, but my intent is not to say that she's \"wrong\", but that she's currently in a place that doesn't say it that way, and she runs the risk of being misunderstood (or actually getting made fun of) if she says it that way. \n\nI think it's playful poking more than anything, and I get the same thing when I go to the UK.  Quite honestly, in my experience they're a lot meaner about it than we are.  Yes, people here giggle at my wife and say \"Wow, that's how you guys pronounce that?\"  In the UK, I've been met with open hostility at how \"arrogant\" we Americans are for changing the way we say a certain word.

Anyways, Change My View, reddit?\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: tamist\n\nResponse A: Here's the thing, weed is different for everyone. While some people (who are usually inclined to be lazy people) do suffering from becoming more lazy after smoking weed, that is most definitely not true of everyone. It's not even common among the people I know who smoke weed. And regardless, as other people on this thread have pointed out, that is true of *any* habit. I know my personal experience is only an anecdotal example, but I'm going to give it to you anyway:\n\nI'm a creative type. I write as my career. A lot of the stuff I write is driven by my passion (and sometimes my anger) at people who appear to me to be making the world worse off (like people against gay marriage, abortion, income equality, etc.). When I see people like this on the internet all day (part of my job), it makes me very angry. Then I come home at the end of a very long and aggravating day of being angry at all the hate in the world... and I take a hit. One hit. From that one hit (okay MAYBE sometimes two depending on the day) I calm down. I am able to focus my energy into my writing. To use my anger productively to write things that hopefully make the world a better place (my writing is much less angry and much more productive after I smoke). Smoking this one (or two) hits does not make me lazy. It does the opposite. It *allows* me to be productive. I suffered from depression for *years* before finding this solution and it has been the only thing that has allowed me to become the even more productive member of society that I am today. It has not had a single bad influence on my life (except that it's driven a wedge between my sister and myself because she has been brainwashed against weed and refuses to accept my lifestyle - but that's not the fault of weed, it's the fault of bad education programs that give false information and her own inability to educate herself). So basically, weed improves my ability to contribute to society, to write things that make the world a better place and to help me deal in a productive way with anger towards people (some of whom I love) who express hurtful opinions towards others. It's fine if you don't want to smoke weed - I am SUPER against peer pressure and am not going to try to convince you to smoke yourself (though I would encourage you to try it if you want to educate yourself on what it actually feels like to be high. But you will find no *pressure* from me on that front). All I will say is that there is a lot of misinformation out there about weed. A lot of lies perpetuated by people who control money and have even more money to gain from prohibition. Weed doesn't harm other people. And it actually *helps* some people (like cancer patients, etc... and people like me). So just... live and let live? I think that's the best path to acceptance on this topic.\n\n\nResponse B Author: turtleintegral\n\nResponse B: I'm not going to attempt to persuade you to start smoking weed, because that's obviously irrelevant to this. There's actually no permanent damage observed related to smoking weed. Marijuana is a relatively safe drug, and is much safer than legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco. I don't think that anyone is going to argue that it is 100% safe to use, but it does not cause significant harm to its users.\n\nHere is an important question to ask when it comes to the actions of other people. How does it affect you/society? People who choose to smoke marijuana in their own homes and do not drive do not affect you in anyway, therefore it should not be of your concern if people do that. Why do you care about what people do with their time/money if it doesn't affect you?\n\nHow people smoking weed affects society is hard to answer, but one way to to look at it is to examine how stoned drivers drive compared to sober drivers. While driving stoned is never a good idea, the evidence shows that [stoned drivers do not get into accidents at any significantly higher rate than sober drivers](http://norml.org/library/item/marijuana-and-driving-a-review-of-the-scientific-evidence).

As a matter of fact, marriage can actually compromise a couple's happiness.\n\nMarriage is confining.  Evolutionarily speaking, most people are serial monogamists.  The fact that at least forty percent of American marriages are marked by adultery makes this apparent.\n\nThe majority of marriages are unhappy.  In the West, over half of  marriages end in separation or divorce. One cannot pretend that remaining marriages survive because their participants are so happy.  Often, marriages persist due to religious, financial, and emotional threats.  \n\nSeparations and divorces can be crippling.  When one partner is the \"breadwinner\" and the other is the homemaker, the homemaker is often left financially dependent.  Children can suffer immensely from relocation and emotional strife that develops within the family. \n\nI understand the financial perks of marriage and possible benefits of marriage when there are children.  I am not against anybody's *right* to marry.  However, as the son of two parents who had a nasty split, I am reminded of the pitfalls of marriage everyday.   \n\nI don't want to feel this way, though.  I hope the evidence is there to change my view.  I would love a long-term partner, but think many girls would see a guy against marriage as one who cannot commit.  \n\n\nResponse A Author: HeartyBeast\n\nResponse A: \nIf you choose it to be. All marriage is, is ceremonial, formal commitment, made to society, solemnised by the state and usually in front of friends and family. It's a commitment to care for each other until you die.\n\nIt doesn't have to be costly. It *can* be if you want to throw a big party.  But it's important to distinguish between the intrinsic aspects of a marriage and the peripheral trappings that can be associated with it.\n\nYes, marriage *is* confining, in the same way that any binding agreement between two parties is confining. It's based on trust. If the trust dies, so does the marriage. \n\nYes marriage *can* be difficult. \n\nYes, when marriages fail it can be nasty and heartbreaking.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that \"marriage\" is bullshit. I'm lucky. As the son of two parents who have just had their 60th wedding anniversary, and who lives in a family where there have been no divorces among anyone in my extended family, and who is just coming up for my 12th wedding anniversary, I'm reminded of the benefits of marriage every day.\n\nWould we have been as happy if we cohabited? Quite possibly, but the public pledge was arbitrarily important to us. Would your parents have been as unhappy if they had cohabited? Quite possibly.\n\nI'm really sorry about your parents. It's a horrible thing to happen to you, regardless of your parent's marital status.\n\nYou've just made me go and tell the kids that I love them - and they looked at me most strangely, I might have to give the wife an extra hug when she gets back from work.\n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: \nWow... isn't it a bit selfish? Our ceremony was basically a big thank-you gift to our parents. It was not for our own happiness! For us, it was hard work to make every guest entertained, it was one of the hardest day of our lives! We showed our parents we came of age, and now we take over the mantle from them for continuing the family.\n\nOf course we love each other, but it is not a selfish joy, but the **pride** felt over doing our **duty** to family, nation, mankind, to be real adults and reproduce!\n\nLook, if you just look things on from a selfish angle you miss the greatest pleasures of life. Like this kind of pride.\n\nAnd the wedding was like an initation ceremony, like into an elite secret society - we members of the \"elite\" club of Makers of Humans! We felt insanely proud. Like two people who finally grew up.\n\n\nDon't marry selfish people. Really. Don't marry the kind of calculating person who is always like \"I want to feel happy.\" and \"What is in it for me?\" Marry the kind of girl who feels it is her duty to help her mom with the Xmas cooking. Marry the kind of man who feels like it is his duty ot repaint his dads house. \n\nFor example **never marry a woman who would accept an expensive wedding ring**. It is very selfish of a woman to accept that when a new couple has a lot of expenses, from the wedding to furniture. For example one very good sign of un-selfishness is that if she is frugal with the money, in everything. Mine searched and searched until she found a wedding dress salon that was going out of business and had 90% discounts.\n\nReally not being selfish is the key and then it is OK.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author HeartyBeast's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

One evil-minded camera operator could take the videos/images and embark on a blackmailing spree upon the bathroom-users with the most embarrassing features. You may not have anything to be embarrassed about in the restroom, but what about people with hemorrhoids, people who are incontinent and must wear diapers, people who secretly cross-dress with undergarments, people with sores on their genitalia, people who have undergone sexual reassignment surgery, etc.? Doesn't their wish for privacy matter? Think about the shame and psychological damage this kind of footage would cause, whether used maliciously or not. Is it worth it to ruin a person's private life if another camera outside the bathroom is going to identify the criminal anyway?\n\nResponse B Author: awesomeness0232\n\nResponse B: I understand your point but you're talking about a huge violation of privacy for a small amount of security as most people who walk into a public restroom or changing room aren't at a great risk of being assaulted.

A few of them said things like God coming down from the clouds and saying hello, or him re-arranging the stars to write a message, stuff like that. But then I say, well if that happened would you believe it was actually God causing that, or the scientists who created the simulation in which we live? And they invariably agree with the latter.\n\nMy thesis is: there is no evidence that, to an average atheist, points more to the existence of a God and not to the idea that we are in The Matrix or something equivalent. Therefore atheism is not falsifiable. \n\nResponse A Author: The_Calm\n\nResponse A: I do believe there is a series of points that may counter this:  \n  \nFirst, I don't believe your 'polling' should be taken at face value as representing the average atheist. Even if the average atheist wasn't willing to change their views in light of certain arguments or evidence doesn't mean that their position is not falsifiable.  \n  \nYour point, I believe when put more succinctly, is that if atheists were logically consistent, then their skepticism would not allow anything to ever be evidence of God, any more so than 'x matrix style theory'.  \n  \nYou seem to admit evidence of God would otherwise falsify an atheistic position if it were not for the 'equally as likely competing matrix theory'.\n\nLets, for now, assume all 'matrix style theories' were proven false somehow, leaving the question entirely of whether or not a God is responsible for our reality.  \n  \nIf God was proven to exist through some hypothetical method it would obviously prove strong atheists wrong because they say there is no God. For Soft atheists, they do not say there is no God, but that it is unreasonable to conclude that there is a God. Obviously, again, proving God exists proves them wrong.  \n  \nIn both cases, if it was entirely about God proving himself, regardless of alternative theories, atheism would be falsifiable if it could be established that there is reason to believe in God.  \n  \nThis is important because it helps establish the only thing blocking, according to your thesis, atheism from being falsifiable, and that's the fact that no evidence, no matter how logical or blatant could disprove the possibility that everything is a false reality. So, in order to show that atheism is falsifiable, we must prove that reality is real... or merely that its unreasonable to think otherwise.  \n  \nI would wager, without official resources or citations at my disposal, that the average atheist actually would find the idea of God existing more reasonable than the matrix theory. We use many justifications for why our perceived reality can be reasonably taken at fact value. Basically, we assign more logical stock in 'reality' than we do the idea that it's false. This can be demonstrated in our behavior. We behave in such a way that we are betting on reality being real and relevant. We never hold the 'matrix theory' as being on equal terms as math, science, or our perceptions. As such, it would be dishonest, if God was demonstrated via math, science, or our perception, to all of a sudden assign equal value to the 'matrix' theory. If God was proven by logic, our perception, science, or math, then if we are being consistent, we would not choose the matrix theory over the God proof, thus making atheism, in all its forms, falsifiable.  \n  \nHowever, this is only if we go off of how the average atheist thinks (and I believe I safely assume the average atheist bets on reality being real each day). I, earlier pointed out that a position being falsifiable is not reliant on how the group would react (if honest), but instead is based on what the 'logically' consistent course is.  \n  \nBy that I mean, what if we are wrong to value perceived reality as being on a greater level than the matrix theory? Many would say that would be wrong indeed, making my entire point refuted at this point. I only pointed out that atheists, (all people actually) behave as if this debate between reality and the matrix has long been settled. That doesn't mean it actually is. If atheists cannot logically show why reality is more logical to conclude than any 'matrix theory' then it would indeed appear that no matter how convincing God is in this reality, it could all just as easily be dismissed as illusion.  \n  \nWhat we have demonstrated in this, is that there is an inconsistent use of your word 'falsifiable'. If atheism cannot be falsified because of 'the matrix' then in this same method, nothing ever could be falsified.  \n  \nIt appears, even for this question to be asked, we much assume several things. First, we must assume logic is the best determination for 'truth'. For anything to be false or true, there must be some agreed method to determine such qualities. I assume logic, and all it entails, is the method we are using.  \n  \nAs such, anything that can be logically concluded as true is to be considered true. If the matrix was true, then nothing else could be, at least in the way we mean it. At this point we accept logic and all of its conclusions. So if we accept that your question means anything, then we acknowledge logic as being a valid determination of truth quality. Therefore, because logic can determine what is true or false, then a God proven true or false via a logically valid and sound method would falsify atheism.  \n  \nFurther complicating matters is if you say that God cannot be proven true via logic, either because he does not exist, or because his nature prevents such a thing. In this case, atheism is only not falsifiable because it is true in one sense or another. If God does not exist, then both atheism, strong and soft are true. If God eludes the ability to be concluded logically, then the soft atheist is right in claiming God cannot be logically concluded.  \n  \nOnly then is not being falsifiable a flaw if all correct claims are not flawed because they two are not falsifiable. No true claim can actually be falsifiable without creating a contradiction.  \n  \n**TL;DR**  \n  \nIn conclusion, if anything can be falsified, then the 'matrix theory' is irrelevant, otherwise it would prevent every position ever taken to be not falsifiable. For the same reason a scientific theory can be falsified without invoking 'the matrix' so can the atheist's claim. If you do hold that the matrix theory prevents atheism from being falsifiable, and therefore every other position possible, then it being not falsifiable is irrelevant.  \n  \nFinally, if logic is a sufficient determination of truth, then atheism can only be not falsifiable, in a sense, if its true, meaning its impossible to falsify that which is true. It does, not, though, follow that all things not falsifiable are true.  \n  \nVerdict: Only an intellectually dishonest atheist would use the matrix theory to escape what would otherwise be proof of God.\n\nResponse B Author: DashingLeech\n\nResponse B: Atheism isn't a belief; it is the lack of a belief. Specifically, it is the lack of a belief in a deity. Atheism is simply the statement, *I do not hold a belief in a god*. It is no different from the lack of a belief in pink unicorns. That is fundamentally different from saying that pink unicorns do not, or cannot, exist. To be unconvinced in something isn't the same as saying it *doesn't* or *can't* exist. There is nothing to be falsified in atheism because there is no hypothesis presented.\n\nHaving made that clear, you seem to be referring to a specific subset of atheism, what is sometimes called *strong atheism*, which makes the positive claim, \"I believe there is no god.\" But is it claimed to be a *scientific* claim? I don't see that anywhere. But let's treat it as a such and see what happens.\n\nTo be a testable hypothesis you need to define exactly what it is you are testing. What is \"god\"? Does it mean a pantheistic god? A deistic god? A personal god? Does it mean the Christian god? (And which one of the many different ones of various sects?) Does it mean Allah? Does it mean the Jewish god? Does it mean Vishnu? Thor? Zeus? There have been [thousands](http://www.rationalresponders.com/a_big_list_of_gods_but_nowhere_near_all_of_them) of claimed gods. In order to prove a specific one doesn't exist, we need to specify which one. \n\nOr perhaps you want a generic test for all of them. Fine, then you need to define what specific trait such a generic god would have. Some may be falsifiable, some not. For example, if we say, \"Praying to the Christian god does not improve the health outcomes of sick people.\" Well, that *is* falsifiable. It can be falsified if people prayed for had better health outcomes than people not prayed for. In fact, we have studied that and it [wasn't falsified](http://web.med.harvard.edu/sites/RELEASES/html/3_31STEP.html). We could do this one by one with every claim of every god, so long as the claim interacts with the world we live in. All falsifiable.\n\nHowever, this still doesn't falsify the \"no god exists\" claim. It is simply whack-a-mole of individual claims, and certainly could never work when it comes to things outside of measurable phenomena. Like, for instance, if the claimed trait of a god is omniscience, then we can't test that at all. \n\nSo indeed, there can never be a generic test for all traits of all possible gods. So does that make you correct? Well, in a trivial way. You can't falsify claims that do not interact with our universe, like some being existing somewhere with some properties.\n\nBut this is somewhat moot. The same is true of any imaginable statement that doesn't interact with our universe, like saying there is an invisible pink unicorn standing in front of me. It has no mass and doesn't interact with any forces because it is supernatural. It may sound contradictory (\"pink\" and \"invisible\"), but it is invisible to *us* but pink in its own eyes. Same deal. Can't falsify that.\n\nBut again, that is all trivial. The statement, \"There are no gods\" is not a scientific claim. Indeed it is *not* falsifiable; it is shorthand for saying \"There are no good reasons for believing in gods.\" That is a falsifiable statement, and it is correct. There really are no good reasons for it, because those reasons would require sufficient evidence that *requires* a god (with certain traits) to exist. Saying \"God causes it to rain\" and using the rain as evidence fails this because it doesn't *require* a god; rain happens easily.\n\nAlso included in this shorthand, by implication, is that \"all claimed gods are manufactured by humans\". That too is falsifiable, and certainly analysis of history, changes and adaptations of beliefs and texts, all provide good evidence that this is the case. It *could* be falsified by some evidence that humans couldn't have made up a certain god, but so far no such evidence exists.\n\n**TL;DR: 1. Atheism is a lack of belief, not a claim, so falsifiability can't even attach. 2. The claim of *strong atheism* is not falsifiable, but only trivially so. 3. The underlying claim of all atheism is that there is insufficient reason to believe that a god or gods exist, and that statement *is* falsifiable and has not been falsified.**Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author The_Calm's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

In this sense patriarchy may be a \"natural\" tradition. This does not imply that patriarchy is good or justified though.\n\nThe reason I think patriarchies outperformed matriarchies is that primitive societies were in no position to compensate for the potential distortions in judgement caused by the menstrual cycle of women. PMS in particular has unpredictable psychological consequences for women. On the average, it seems likely that men would be more consistent decision makers than women.\n\nAlthough men do not have better judgement than women do on average, a man of good judgement is more likely to be consistent than a woman of good judgement, due to the psychological effects of the menstrual cycle on the woman.\n\nAnd to reiterate, I am aiming at an explanation for patriarchy with reference to the efficient cause, not at a justification for patriarchy. \n\nTo clarify what I mean by \"primitive\": I mean primitive with special emphasis on the sophistication of the society's psychological science. Societies that can measure, predict or otherwise compensate for the psychological effects of menstruation, may not have any use for the \"no-female-leaders\" heuristic. Therefore, the advance of psychology as science has potentially made patriarchy obsolete. \n\n\nI'm not understanding the reasoning behind men are stronger - therefore patriarchy yet.

This entire post is just a bunch of \"bio truthz\": made up shit that sounds right based on one's limited knowledge of biology and evolution.\n\nFor instance you claim periods would make women unstable.

Women only started having monthly periods in the modern world. \n\nFurther, men have a hormonal cycle just like women, only theirs is a daily cycle of hormone fluctuations while modern women have a monthly cycle of hormone fluctuations. So hormonal changes are not exclusive to women.\n\nFinally, all the actual historians and sociologists point to women's weaker physical strength in the \" might is right \" ancient worlds and their vulnerability during reproduction as the reason for patriarchy. \n\nResponse B Author: fluffhoof\n\nResponse B: http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/515907?uid=3737856&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104898266223\n\nMale animals (I'm not aware of any studies done on humans, so lizards will have to do for my argument) also have fluctuating hormone levels, except it seems to be more unpredictable than the menstrual cycle (as in, there's no bleeding to mark a point in the cycle). \n\nWhy do you personally think men have more stable judgement with this information in mind?

(In my mind, I've said those words so often that I feel like Troy McClure.) So, here's me trying my best to explain...\n\nThink of everything that reminds you of sex. I'll wait.\n\nFinished yet? \n\nMaybe a better challenge would be to think of something that can't be used to remind you of sex. \n\nOr, another way to look at it, if you've had sex with strong emotions attached - think about how often memories of it summoned up those emotions. I hope those emotions were love, and wonder, and joy. \n\nFor me it's more like - \n\nThink of everything sexual as a gun pointed at your head. \n\nImagine it has magic bullets that take you back in time to the moment when you were raped. \n\nNow imagine nobody believes you, when you try to talk about this gun. Or worse, they hate you. So you keep quiet. But imagine that even a touch from someone you love feels like fire, and you cry, without meaning to...\n\nOr, maybe it's not that simple. Maybe the rape increased your libido. That happens too, and it's used to claim the victim was just a slut who wanted it. Imagine going through life as the victim of a horrible crime, but being treated like the criminal, over and over again. \n\nHowever it happened, you will be put on trial. Did you resist enough to count as a victim? Are there marks? Have you ever enjoyed rough sex? Are you mentally ill? Have you had contact with the accused after it happened? Did you make any jokes, talking about it? Why? Did you have no emotion at all? Why not? Can you account for every single moment? Shouldn't that be easy if you keep going back to the rape? \n\nAnd it's not. It's really fucking not, because some of your memories are as intense as if they were carved by lasers, but others are broken, or missing, and you can't understand what's not there and why, because almost nobody fucking understands how traumatic memories work. \n\nAnd I know that's a problem for anything traumatic, but you never see soldiers with PTSD called fucking sluts.

What I mean is that if a person is raped it will often make any subsequent sexual experience, even with someone they love and who loves them, much more difficult because many rape victims have a very difficult time forgetting what happened to them and are forced to confront it every time they have sex. With battery you would not be forced to confront it in your normal, everyday life once the abuser is removed from your life.

During these fresh air breaks I shoot the shit with smokers, just like when I was a smoker.  \n* Quitting smoking greatly reduced my average anxiety level moment-to-moment.  This is a boon for socializing, as I already have some social anxiety.  \n* Being out with friends and acquaintances, for example at a table at a bar, as a non-smoker has allowed me entry into a social space I did not realize existed:  the long, ongoing conversation at the table.  As a smoker I frequently left to go outside to smoke, and when I did so I entered a new social setting but I also left one.  Being present, for long unbroken periods of time in a group setting allows me to more fully develop bonds with the others who stay inside, largely due to the fact that I am a part of the long-lasting conversation that happens in there.  This has allowed me to become much more fluent in *group* conversation, not just *one-on-one* conversation.  \n* I do miss the stranger-love of bumming cigarettes to and fro.  \n* Smokers *stink* like crazy!  Because smoking affects your sense of smell, this goes largely un-noticed by smokers.  Even though a friend of mine routinely told me \"you stink\" every time we hugged, I always thought he was referring to a small effect.  No - it's a huge effect which drastically alters your social appearance.  (smell is huge in connecting with people).  The smell is really bad - almost like BO but a little less offensive.  Basically about as powerful as the smell of gasoline if there's a puddle of it.  Imagine if you knew someone who sometimes reeked of gasoline, or maybe rotting bread.  \n\nResponse B Author: man2010\n\nResponse B: You could argue that the water cooler or break room in a work environment gives the same social value as smoking. I know it's cliche, but if multiple people gather around the water cooler in an office at the same time it can turn into a short social situation, much like smoking breaks. The same can be said for the break room: if multiple people in an office take their break at the same time and use the break room at the same time then it turns into a routine social situation.\n\nAs for how this applies to bars, concerts, clubs, bowling alleys, etc. these things generally involve people taking a break from what they're doing. If I'm at a bar/club every once in a while I like to step out with a few friends to get some fresh air. If I'm at a concert I might want to take a break to grab food/drinks. Same with a bowling alley. These are all situations which can result in social interaction for a short period of time between a small group of people, just like smoking.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author intensely_human's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I'm assuming not, but I'm curious.\n\nSecond, especially in Pre-K and 1st/2nd grade, reading and spelling and writing are huge.  My son in particular has excellent math, science, and reading scores, but struggles with writing - this is a toolset that may or may not be as necessary to him as it was to previous generations, but it is a dying art and still necessary, and needs to be worked on.  He's also not alone in this problem, as his teachers have mentioned several times that they're increasingly seeing this as an issue.\n\nThere's also reasonable research that says that more than 2 hours of screen time is detrimental to kids; by putting extremely intense focus on this in the curriculum, you're making it worse, not better.\n\nhttp://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pediatricians-no-more-than-2-hour-screen-time-kids/\n\nAs for philosophy, as a rather avid student of it, I'm very much in favor of the theory; problematically, you're going to run into two things: one, which philosophy do you teach? Better be careful, because Nietzsche is right the heck out - God is dead won't play well in many classrooms, I suspect, because the parents would be ready to kill you instead.  Two, kids at that age aren't really ready for the intellectual weight of many of philosophy's more esoteric concepts - they're still learning basic addition; by fourth grade, you're advancing somewhat, but a ten to eleven year old is probably not going to be able to grasp existentialism versus nihilism.\n\nBasic history is probably a much better base; easier to learn events and then the reason behind them than vice versa.\n\nResponse B Author: Raintee97\n\nResponse B: Upon further examination of your idea,\n\n Your first and second language idea is sound. Then again you need to figure out how you're doing your send language instruction. Are you going to go immersion? Then you will need to train and recruit the teachers that can do that. There are already some school experimenting with this. Some of my friends have their kids in Mandarin - English programs. Half the day is in English, the rest in Mandarin. You just need to make sure you would have the teachers to be able to do it. \n\n Math is sound as well. \n\n Philosophy is far too advanced, but history and basic information about science isn't. \n\nKids at that age tend to be a lot more concrete. They have a hard time grasping abstractions. they often learn about the world via what they can see and touch \n\n I would take out philosophy and include some type of art or science/ social science content. You don't want kids starting at grade five with no knowledge of those two areas. Arts are important, but of a lot of studies that support that arts help kids to develop parts of their brain.

There are several types of prologues, and for each one I can see reasons that they're not needed. I feel that often, inexperienced writers include them because they've read other fantasy novels that have them and think you're meant to have a prologue in a fantasy novel, but I don't think they work for novels.\n\nI refer only to novels in this instance, not to other media like movies, TV shows and comics. I think prologues work fine in visual media, especially films where the first couple of minutes might be accompanied by latecomers finding their seats and conversations begun during the adverts trailing off, to make sure the audience are paying attention.\n\nBut in fantasy novels in particular, they're usually one of the following types:\n\n1. The history of the world/universe/country. An info dump of history, stars swirling, worlds forming, battles fought and lost or won, magic systems, dragons disappearing and all that stuff. These are boring, because the author is giving me information about a world I have no reason to care about yet, often in a fairly dry tone, lacking in conflict and characters. And what's more, all the information which is actually important can be fed into the story or hinted at gradually - a method I far prefer, because I like working things out about the world as I read and building up my understanding over time.\n\n2. The \"father of the hero\" type prologue. Doesn't necessarily include the father of the hero, but often does. This is a scene set, usually, a generation or so earlier than the rest of the novel, involving characters who either don't reappear at all or don't reappear until the final third of the book, by which time I've forgotten about them. I don't like this type of prologue because it gets me invested in a set of characters only to break with them at the end of the prologue and try to get me invested with a fresh set of characters, and because, as with the history of the world type, they often contain information that could be woven into the story gradually instead.\n\n3. The \"hero's normal life\" prologue. At worst, this type is boring, tedious and irrelevant. Sometimes it lacks conflict, just showing how fantastic everything is for the protagonist before something comes along and ruins things. At best, it could be renamed \"chapter 1\". Either it shouldn't be there, or it shouldn't be called a prologue.\n\n4. The \"bad things are happening elsewhere\" type prologue. This is the least bad of the lot, I suppose, but still better suited to screen than page. This usually includes either (a) the villain concocting a plan or giving order that will disrupt stuff for the hero we have yet to meet, or (b) some poor sap gets murdered by something. Often, prologues of this type are vague or are clearly deliberately keeping some key piece of information back from the reader.\n\nIn general, all prologues share a key flaw: the book has to start twice. The prolgoue is usually self-contained, and so reaching the end of the prologue is like reaching the end of a short story, without the kind of hook to read on and find out what happened to character X that you find at the end of chapters. There's little or no investment in characters, because either there weren't any or those that there were don't reappear until much later in the book, if ever.\n\nI therefore find prologues pretty offputting. I will acknowledge that there are some that are done well, by the more experienced writers like George R R Martin, but most of the time seeing the word \"prologue\" on the first page puts me in a mindset that's a lot more critical than I would otherwise be. I want my attitude changed because this isn't a good way to start reading a book. In fact I've not finished a book in months, though I've started a few.\n\nSaying \"the prologue in book X is good\" isn't going to change my view, because I know some prologues are good, but I feel on balance that they're not a good idea for newer authors in particular.\n\nI'm not sure what will change my view. A new perspective I've not thought of, I suppose.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: sunnyEl-ahrairah\n\nResponse A: Often the prologue is a framing the device for the rest of the story, and carefully reading it changes how the reader interprets the story.  \n\nA great example of this is The Scarlet Letter.  The prologue sets up how the manuscript was found, but also reveals the mindset of the person who found it.  That mindset reveals where their sympathies lie, and changes how the story is read (did I avoid enough spoilers?).\n\nSo reading the prologue tips me off to the themes to watch out for, brings up questions I should be asking, and, if I re-read, forces me to re-evaluate conclusions I drew from my first reading.  It's like a friend introducing me to someone I've already met; their experience with the person colors and re-colors my own, adding further depth.\n\nOf course, any bad writer can screw up any part of a good read.  But the decision to structure the book a certain way is in the hands of the creator, and I have to trust them.  And let's face it, there's only one true solution to having a great reading experience- read good books.\n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: So let's see, you say that you find that there are some that are done well, and you respect them, it's just that there are ones that don't like.\n\nOk, well, there's not much anybody can do about that, we'd have to say all prologues are good and that would be foolish.  Even the best author can write part of a very good story in a bad way.\n\nWhat I can suggest is a change to your approach to reading.  Though what you mean by not finishing a book, well, I don't know that, because it could mean you stop towards the end, or never get to the middle, or just stop in the first chapter.  \n\nWhich is it?\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author sunnyEl-ahrairah's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Please read edit.**\n\nFirst and foremost I want to define \u201cfelon\u201d as someone who has actually committed a felony. I don't want this conversation to become about the failings of the justice system. For the purposes of this CMV, I just want to be clear that we are debating whether or not people who have been removed from society for committing heinous crimes should be granted the right to vote.\n\nMy argument is really quite simple. We have removed these people from society specifically because they have committed crimes that are highly destructive of society in general. I hope we can generally all agree that people who destroy lives and threaten society should not be allowed to live among those of us who obey the law and contribute positively to society.\n\nIf these men and women are so dangerous that they must be kept separate from the rest of society, then how does it follow that they should still be allowed to contribute in one of the most important functions of society (voting)? \n\nTo keep it simple, I'm not going to cite an in-depth analysis of the occurrence of mental illness in inmates. The Hare Psychopathy Checklist rates 80-85% of criminals as having Antisocial Personality Disorder. This is a diagnosis that falls just below all-out psychopathy\u2014 a diagnosis that 20% of prison inmates carry. From Wikipedia: \u201cAntisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others.\u201d Also from Wiki, \u201cPsychopathy is traditionally defined as a personality disorder  characterized by enduring antisocial behavior, diminished  empathy and remorse, and disinhibited or bold behavior.\"  \n\nIt seems outrageous to me that people who have no regard for the rights of others should be allowed direct involvement in a practice that affects laws and policy. If we can agree that laws are based on commonly accepted standards of morality and that morality is based on empathy, then people who have proven their lack of empathy through their own criminality should\u2014 almost by definition\u2014 not be given the right to vote. \n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: AlanUsingReddit\n\nResponse A: \nOkay, so then the severity of this depends on the severity of those things classified as felonies.\n\n\nNo we're not.  We're debating whether people convicted of a felony should have a right to vote.\n\n\nThis is divorced from the *actual* definition of felony, as used in our legal systems.  Often, it means a serious crime generally.  In the US, it's a crime that could have more than a 1 year sentence.  *Could*, not *will*.  So a judge might decide that an individual's particular case *isn't* very serious, and it won't fit this criteria.  Really calls into question the objectiveness of the designation.  It certainly doesn't reflect your own idealism.\n\n\nThe most common US felonies are drug offenses, arson, forgery, fraud, and property offenses.\n\nI categorically disagree with you when it comes to drug offenses.  To a lesser extent, I find fraud and property offenses to be debatable.  However, you should really take note of what is *not* in this list.  Assault, rape, murder, and those things *are not the most common* felonies.  Your thinking is not targeting rapists and murderers.\n\n\nInmates, not felons.  That's a selection bias.  Inmates with longer sentences are more likely to be selected for the survey, if we're taking a random sample *of people currently in prison*.\n\nThis is somewhat of a betrayal of your own premise, because the right to vote is only a topic for those who are already *out* of prison.  This group has the reverse bias - those with lighter sentences, who served their time early, and stayed out of prison, are more heavily represented in the population of felons who are living in society.  The subset who are *trying to vote* are subject to an even greater bias, with the most repentant and productive of them turning out to the polls.  Your numbers are not speaking for that group.\n\n\nAnd we come back to drug offenders.  For felonies, these are more *likely* to be dealers, but users are also stuck with felony charges.  The law is only concerned with what quantity and material they're caught with.  It doesn't have to be proved beyond a doubt that they're dealing.\n\nSo your statements are awfully bold, applied to drug users and dealers, who are the main group you're talking about.  Should their crimes be felonies in the first place?  Maybe not.  But as long as they are, it's a label that isn't useful for what you're using it for.\n\nResponse B Author: DocTorrFabulous\n\nResponse B: \nI entirely disagree with this sentiment. Rather, I disagree with your assessment that felons are people who destroy lives and threaten society. marijuana consumption could land me a felony in the military. A DUI could land you a felony, and as heinous a crime as it is, you're still a felon afterwards, even if you ride a bicycle, never touch alcohol again, and spend your spare time rebuilding your community. I have certain firearm that, with a simple modification, would net me a 10 year prison sentence. Each. Perfectly legal to possess in their current state, but $50 in parts (which are also perfectly legal to own) without submitting the tax stamp application would make me a felon, despite having done nothing to threaten society. \n\nYour entire premise is that once a felon, always a rampant menace to society.

Those customers start looking elsewhere.  They might even pay a few bucks more for the same product/service because they hate the monopoly company so much.

You say \"Without being buttressed by the government\" then you describe what happens when a free market responds to a monopolist attempting to monopolize.  \n\n**[point of clarity: monopolies are not bad; a monopolizer is bad, if you're interested, I could explain that further, but it isn't really relevant right now]**\n\nGovernments have been the only way any monopolizer has been able to transfer consumer surplus to the producers (bad conduct).

Rockefeller was even known to sell his products at a loss because, thanks to having enough capital, he could drive his competition out of business long before he ran out of money. Then, once they were gone, he could raise prices again.

The label is abused by people who want to bring their pets with them into inappropriate (human-only) places.\n\nI have no problem with people who like their pets.  But there are good reasons some places prohibit pets.  Animals are generally not sanitary, and are prone to bothering people, urinating and defecating, and being loud.  Most health codes prohibit pets in foodservice establishments for example.\n\nDisabilities accommodation laws allow people with **service animals** to bring those animals into places where they'd otherwise be prohibited.

Honestly, they often don't need special training. I know this is anecdotal, but when I cry, my dog comes and sits next to me. Some animals (like dogs) can detect and react to human emotions without any special training. From a more scientific standpoint, petting your dog has [real, measurable effects on health](http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/05/touching.makes.you.healthier.health/). Relevant section:\n\n\"If you're a pet owner, you've no doubt noticed you're less tense when scratching your animal behind the ears. In fact, research shows that people's blood pressure drops when they pet dogs, particularly if it's a dog they know and love. Dog petting has also been shown to improve immune function and ease pain, or at least the perception of it.\"\n\nHere's an [abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12672376) that says: \"concentrations of beta-endorphin, oxytocin, prolactin, beta-phenylethylamine, and dopamine increased in both species after positive interspecies interaction, while that of cortisol decreased in the humans\". \n\nSo basically, without any special training, pets can provide a source of stress relief and reduce perception of pain.

However I do think it is a more systemic expression because you are correct in that it is silly to protest this specific shooting until more facts are known.\n\nWe have no idea what actually happened and until a couple of months have passed we are unlikely to have any idea.  It is just as dumb to assume the cop acted rightly as to assume he acted poorly - we have no evidence but our biases to base it on at this point.  Once the facts come out it could well be that protests are warranted.\n\nResponse B Author: ciggey\n\nResponse B: \nWithout any further evidence of the case you instantly decided that the cop was acting correctly in shooting Michael Brown? Why? Is it it totally unthinkable that an officer of the law could act wrongfully? There have been many cases like this where the officer received no repercussions. Bad people tend to do everything that they can get away with. \n\n\nNobody is arguing that he is a saint. He might have been a huge asshole for all I know. But the point is that doesn't matter, because that's not how the judicial system works. You can't just shoot people for being an asshole or past robberies. The fact that the police officer shot an unarmed man that posed no lethal threat to him is a sign of an incompetent officer. Police are expected to be capable of arresting people like this, not gun them down on the street. It's not a question of whether the officer is \"a sick fuck\" who likes to kill people, it's about whether some officers are conditioned to use lethal force against any threat or disobedience.   \n\nAlso, you're as wrong as the people who claim he's a saint.

Golf and archery are quite similar, in that they're primarily sports where making perfect, accurate movements with high levels of coordination are most important. Golf drive distance, which can make a pretty huge difference, is also highly influenced by your core strength, height, and general physique. Golf and archery are characterized by the fact that in between shots/strokes, you're generally either sitting or walking, however, this does not change the amount of physical ability and acuity you need when you ARE shooting or taking a swing. \n\nAs a small 5'1\" female, I can usually expect a drive distance of around 100ish yards. Professional golfers who are taller (thus having a stronger drive due to the length of their clubs) with stronger, more athletic bodies than mine can usually drive their ball around 300 yards, a considerable difference that cannot be chalked up solely to skill. A huge part of that is based entirely on physical prowess.\n\nResponse B Author: ohaiihavecats\n\nResponse B: I certainly won't argue for chess being a sport, and golf has already been covered.

When the king died, Kant resumed his attack on religion. In Kant's view only promises made to people had any normative force, so when the person he made his promise to became a corpse (not a person), Kant considered himself absolved of his moral duty. Most non-Kantians (and many Kantians as well) believe this argument fails. The normative force of promises is derived from the duty to respect the autonomy of the subject of the promise (breaking a promise is a kind of lie, and lying violates autonomy), but how can you say you're respecting a person's autonomy when you fully intend to break your promise to them sometime in the future? This is evidence that the autonomy of once-living persons carries at least some normative force after they are dead.\n\nWe can easily see how this relates to cannibalism; unless you have some good reason to believe a person wants to be cannibalized, based on general attitudes toward cannibalism we can assume a person does not want their body to be cannibalized after they die, and to do so would represent Consensual cannibalism may be morally permissible, however it would be so rare that the only way to effectively regulate it is to criminalize it, and place the burden of proof of consent on any would-be cannibals. The status of cannibalism doesn't change for all practical purposes.\n\nResponse B Author: covertwalrus\n\nResponse B: In your post you said that the only thing that would justify both practices being illegal is \"huge health, psychological and practical issues.\" I'm not sure why you'll only be convinced by a critical problem that arises from necrophilia or cannibalism, since you haven't listed any upside to allowing the practices other than simply allowing necrophiliacs or cannibals freedom to let their freak flag fly. Nonetheless, there are some pretty important practical issues.\n\nThere are certain rights you get to have when you die, like having a will. If someone figures out what they want to be done when they die in advance, and after they die, this is enforced, it makes things easier. It's only fair that when you own your house, you get to say who gets to have it when you die. Your family doesn't get to decide it for you, because that leads to inheritance squabbles which, depending on the value of the inheritance, can be divisive, or even bloody. You get to make the same call with your body. If you want to donate your organs when you die, you can do that, but if you don't for some reason, like you have a religious objection to it, or you just don't want your family to worry about you getting hacked up and passed out like a Thanksgiving turkey, you're within your rights to not be an organ donor. If you don't want your remains to be preserved when you die because you think that's bad for the environment, that's up to you. If you want to be stuffed and mounted, that's your prerogative. Your wishes aren't sacred, e.g. if you want to be stuffed and mounted but no taxidermist is willing to taxidermize a human, you're out of luck, but in general, it's your body, you're in charge of it for the whole time you're alive, and you should get to say what happens with it when you're done using it.\n\nSomeone eating or having sex with your corpse is also something you should have a say in. Most people are not okay with the idea of someone having sex with their corpse or eating them. A cannibal or necrophiliac can't ask permission from the person whose corpse they are mucking about with, so unless the person explicitly states in their will that they are okay with being eaten, and dictate who is allowed to eat them, the cannibal is violating the person's death rights. If I have a friend who really wants to have sex with my corpse when I die, and I'm okay with that and indicate clearly and explicitly how that is to happen, maybe that should be okay, but it's such an unusual and specific circumstance that it's not really worth the effort it would take to regulate it.\n\nRegarding stem-cell human meat: If the volunteer is willing and informed of the extent to which their genes will be used to produce meat, I'd say it's fair game. However, it wouldn't be safe for human consumption because of kuru, and should therefore never be FDA approved or sold as food. It's not the same as chopping up and eating a cadaver, but it's not a good idea, either.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author gunchart's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Rich people will finance and give so much more opportunities (education, experiences, contacts, influence) to many generations of their offspring, how young people can compete equally so their merit will decide who deserves what and gives the best individuals of a society the top positions!?. Only moral heritage should be valid.\n\nResponse A Author: downfallndirtydeeds\n\nResponse A: What if you're poor? Then material heritage is actually crucial to social mobility, if your kids can raise children in a house already paid for they can invest more education and the child's development. \n\nThe problem is excessive material heritage right? So material heritage isn't a moral evil, unjust and pernicious property rights and resource allocation are. \n\nWe also allow it for the same reason we allow people to keep their organs, because it might tramatise someone whilst they're still ALIVE to not get what they want. Just as the dying muslim might worry about his place in heaven, so will the dying banker worry for his son and daughter. At that point, there is an active infringement on your ability to be happy, sure that has to be weighted against the harm brought about by property rights, but you can see how declaring it an objective evil is a bit far? \n\nResponse B Author: Surrealis\n\nResponse B: First of all, I challenge the notion that in a perfect society means that a person should need to work hard to have certain opportunities, especially education and experiences (Granted, that's kind of an overbroad category). If we want to identify certain advantages that people can have and try to better society by giving people equal access to them, our solution should be making these things available to the people who don't already have them. This is especially true of factors that the people affected could have no control over (E.G. access to quality education as a child) which themselves will often have a large influence on that person's ability to succeed in and contribute to society as a whole.\n\nPersonal material heritage is not only a motivation for some people to work hard, but also is an emergent property of the concept of *property in general* along with the most-likely-evolved behavior of caring for one's own family. You can't have a concept of ownership of property without the ability to transfer said ownership, and most humans (and mammals) have both a pragmatic vested interest and a strong emotional desire for the well-being of their children. So while there may be some truth to the idea that property inheritance breaks a strict meritocracy, I'd argue that no matter how true that is, it's the lesser of two evils compared to literally any conceivable enforcement scheme for outlawing inherited property. \n\nOn top of that, trying to enforce an inability to accumulate wealth, either generationally for a family or for an individual, is never going to work out. In the best case you disincentivise extraordinary contribution, and in the worst case, people will just revolt against whatever enforcement mechanism you have set up. If you want to create an egalitarian society in which everyone has good opportunities to succeed, you need to prop up the poor, and eliminate the concept that a person who was not born into wealth can't have access to sufficient food, shelter, social networks, healthcare, education, and job opportunities.

CMV\n\nOp: Historically, human population growth went along with increases in food production and the switch from subsistence farming to larger scale farming and eventually industrial farming. \n\nThese increases in food production were made possible by a string of innovations and increases in productivity through technological and methodological advances in farming, like crop rotation, better plowing tools, use of animal labour, use of manure as fertilizer, breeding of crops and livestock, chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides, and, as of late, genetic modification of crops.\n\nToday is the first time in recorded history that we deliberately use farming methods that decrease output under the moniker of organic food production. \n\nI believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies, and is what we here know as a \"first world problem\". This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more wide-spread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.\n\nI don't contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the risk/benefit balance right, and yes, there are risks, hazards and dangers associated with them. I don't contest either, that early pesticides were rather poisonous and at times did more harm than good, especially when used naively.\n\nHowever, science and engineering progress all the time, pesticides become better, more specific, fertilizers become better to handle, cheaper and less energy-intensive to produce, GMO crops continue what breeding programs have done in the past, that is improve a plant species for more and potentially healthier output with equal production cost.\n\nAnd thus, I believe that organic food production is a dangerous fad, and that to increase food output and eradicate hunger and malnutriton we must use and improve industrial farming methods, using and improving all means available to us intelligently and wisely and without the prejudice of labelling something that came out of a chemical plant as \"bad\" while labelling something that came out of a cow's arse as somehow magically \"good\", and instead have a sane cost/benefit analysis that takes into account all that is availabe to us.\n\nQuite simply, we must not throw away much of the food production techniques what served us well the last couple of hundred years because that could kill a large portion of humans alive today.\n\nChange my view.\n\nResponse A Author: ThePantsParty\n\nResponse A: You're correct that it's possible because we live in a first-world society where we have a glut of food available.  The reason this is correct is because this glut means that the food supply exceeds the demand, thereby leaving room for the lower yields that organic farming produces, because even with the lower yields, we still have too much food here.  If things were to progress to the point you fear though, where demand exceeds supply, then the market would push things back to the more efficient methods in order to cover this unmet demand.\n\nSo yes, it is a product of a luxury culture, but its existence is predicated on that luxury culture of excess food existing, and if this excess ever vanished, then organic farming would be forced to scale back accordingly.\n\nResponse B Author: watchout5\n\nResponse B: \nIn a capitalist society food output has very little to do with eradicating hunger and malnutrition. In America specifically almost $200 billion dollars worth of food is thrown out each year simply for display purposes. I argue only that these are unknown variables to us. If ending hunger and malnutrition was really a priority it would be easy to do even if we were forced through some kind of magic to only grow \"organic\" food that would be paid for by tax dollars and given to anyone who's hungry.\n\nHow much arable land do we have? Roughly how much food would need to be produced in order to feed all of us? I don't think either of those questions have honest answers, just guesses. Without answers to those questions I don't believe it's possible to make conclusions, to me the market is trying to figure out what people want and is attempting to meet that demand. Not much more than that. Without clear policy direction it's all theory to me, and there's nothing wrong with discussing theory but unless the call is to change us out from a capitalist system there's really nothing I see changing about the way people want to choose to eat, especially when government bodies like the FDA are in the pockets of big business.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author ThePantsParty's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: Up until now I have never had a smart phone. I have always stuck with the old flip phones, mostly because I didn't want to pay the monthly data charge. I just entered my first year of college and decided that now was the time for my long overdue upgrade. I decided to wait until the iPhone 5s was at least announced to see what if any new features were added. I know some people hate apple and insist that there are much petter phones  available for a similar price or cheaper. As of now, I still plan on getting the iPhone because I believe it is a better phone. Change my view.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: kwood09\n\nResponse A: To address the issue of iPhone exclusivity:\n\nThere are lots of good things that iPhone has, and indeed some of them (Facetime comes to mind especially) really are exclusive to iPhone. However, because Android is so customizable and doesn't exercise tight control over what sort of apps you can have, you can almost always find apps that will emulate, replicate or even improve upon features found on the iPhone. For example, my friends mostly have iPhones and would use iMessage to send group texts. My Android phone wouldn't link all the texts together into one thread, but all I had to do was go download an app, and instantly I had a messaging app that was far superior to anything iPhone or stock Android offers. \n\nAndroid has a much, much larger marketshare than iPhone, and while there are some apps that are exclusive to iOS, I would say that 99% of apps you would want are available for Android. And that number's only growing larger as businesses and developers realize that iPhone's not really where it's at anymore. And because Android is so much more open, these apps are often capable of doing much more than iPhone apps are. \n\nTo address the issue of compatibility:\n\nRegardless of whether you go with Android or iPhone (and to be sure, I think iPhone is a perfectly fine choice, but you asked to have you view changed so I'll do my best), I think you would be much better off by trying to get yourself into the Google ecosystem as much as possible. Think about this: before you got your Mac for graduation, how much was Apple involved in your life? Perhaps an iPod with iTunes? Now think about how much Google is involved in your life. These may not all apply to you, but I can tell you that I use, Search, Voice, Drive, Gmail, YouTube, Chrome, Picasa/Google+ photos, Maps(!!), and Calendar every single day. These are all Google products. They are better than their Apple counterparts in my opinion. So even if you do go iPhone, I think you're better off with Google integration. Obviously these things work better and more seamlessly with Android. \n\nMaps brings me to another point. Apple forces you to have it their way. Remember the big uproar over Apple Maps a few months ago? Apple decided to ditch Google Maps and make their own program, and while you can still download Google Maps, you can't make it your default maps program. So if you click a link to an address in a text or on a website, it will open Apple Maps. You have to do it manually if you want Google. And the same can be said for everything. On Android, I use my own apps for email, messaging, camera and a bunch of other services. Apple doesn't want you to do that; it wants you to use all of their stuff. \n\nI'm typing this on a Mac right now, and I love this computer, but I'm telling you that using the web and Google apps on your Android with provide you with more seamless integration than iPhone/Mac OS ever could. And this is coming from someone who used to use iOS. \n\nIn addition to things you listed, if you go with Android, you have any number of choices. You can get a phone the same size as iPhone, or you can get one a bit bigger, or you can get one a lot bigger. I have small hands, and while I used to like the small iPhones, they now feel miniscule to me (even the 5 and 5S). That extra real estate makes a huge difference. \n\niPhone is fine, and if you really prefer it, go for it. But the two concerns you listed aren't actually a big deal, for reasons I've explained. I think Android is better. Feel free to ask me any more questions. \n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: I have the Samsung 4s (I used to have the iPhone 4) and I think the Samsung is much better than the iPhone. However, my caveat is that I really like tech stuff so I appreciate the more powerful 4s. It takes longer to get used to and it isn't as intuitive but it is far more customizable and powerful. \n\nMy thought process was this, \"It's my phone, I'll have it with me all day so I'll have plenty of time to get used to it.\" After about a week (compared to 1-2 days with the iPhone) I had gotten used to my much more powerful and customizable phone. The screen is bigger, the camera is crazy good and the video quality is excellent. I can't speak on American pricing because I got my phone in Hong Kong but here it is much cheaper. \n\nI LOVE the homescreen for the samsung. You get widgets that you can customize and, instead of just seeing your apps, you get a \"mini version\" of said applications. For example, if you like sports, instead of just getting the scorecenter app you will also get a widget that ticks through scores on the homescreen. Same goes for twitter, news apps, youtube and health stuff. Eventually, you customize a homebase that has all the things you find important in a mini version. This way you can just look at it for 30 seconds and put it back in your pocket. \n\nSo yeah, that is my pitch for the Samsung 4s. Unless things change in the next 2 years I will certainly stay with Samsung for my next phone purchase.

I am not talking about the sun-sign-only astrology that says \"all Pisces are gonna have a [fill in the blank] day.\" I'm talking about the involved kind of astrology where you make a chart of where the planets were at your time of birth and analyze the aspects these planets make to each other. You can also analyze how two people interact based on their planet placements. If you familiarize yourself with the more complex type of astrology, it will help your argument against my views.\n\nI know that there is no known scientific basis for astrology, so I shouldn't believe in it. However, so many of the things I have read in my charts and my romantic partners' charts have been dead-on accurate. I actually love learning about science and thinking critically about the world around me, so taking that angle would be appreciated. I do, however, have a strong belief that some things in the universe are too big and grand for human beings to comprehend and perceive.\n\nThe reason I discount confirmation bias is because I have used astrology to analyze relationships/ events both before AND after the fact, and have found the same level of truth.\n\nI genuinely want to stop believing in astrology, because it has had a negative impact on my life. I tend to fixate on negative things. Astrology just really doesn't serve me and the way I want to live my life. \n\nTL;DR: Please help me stop believing in astrology! I'm not talking about newspaper horoscopes.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: loughmiller\n\nResponse A: Try this experiment:  Pick a random birthday/time that is similar in age to you.  Work really hard to pretend that you just found out that you were wrong about your original birthday, and this is your new birthday.\n\nGo build all your charts, analyze the planets and all that.  Get back to us on how accurate things are with this new birthday.\n\nResponse B Author: BaltimoreC\n\nResponse B: Here's an experiment you could try with your friends and family members: gather a group of 4 or 5 together and give them your natal chart results.  Don't tell them it's yours.  After they have all read it, tell them it is the chart of one or more people at the table and have them guess whose it could be.  Conduct this test again, but do it with the chart of someone who is not in attendance (or a random chart) and ask them to guess whose chart it could be.  This gives you a way to test the Forer Effect, while also seeing if the people closest to you agree with the reading you got.\n\nUnless everyone chooses you in the first test, and doesn't choose anyone in the second test, you should at least begin to see how people can perceive themselves and others in different ways when prompted to do so.  This is all astrology and natal readings do; they paint with a broad brush in a way that the majority of people will be happy with.\n\nOther things to think about:\n\nShould Pluto's recent removal of planethood effect natal readings?  What about if a new planet joined our Solar System?  How would that change things, if at all?  Would it change things retroactively for people born before the new planet joined the solar system?\n\nWhat if, in the future, people are born on the Moon, or Mars?  How would that affect their reading?  What if they aren't born on a planet at all, but in transit between planets?  \n\nI also encourage you to look at these experiments further:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natal_astrology#Scientific_AppraisalWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author loughmiller's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: Let me start by explaining what free solo climbing is to those who are not familiar with it. It is an activity in which you climb without a harness or rope. That is, without any safety precautions what so ever. The routes that are climbed are anything from 15 meters to over 500.\nThe most common reasons I've heard for which this is practised is the need for adrenaline, new perspective on the world and yourself, and the need to find new challenges or to do what no one else has ever done.\nI simply do not understand understand these arguments. In a world as big as ours, a person can spend his whole life travelling and still not be able to see and do everything. How can one not find a way to challenge him/herself without running such an incredibly huge life threatening risk? It feels like these individuals are more in love with the fact of being so near death than anything else, which is why I believe they do not appreciate life as much as a person should.\n\nResponse A Author: moonflower\n\nResponse A: In some ways it's a bit of a paradox, that some people feel like they are living life to the full when they are engaged in the most dangerous activities ... the fear, the personal challenge, the adrenaline rush, the exhilaration, make the person feel so *alive* ... some people are so afraid to take risks, so afraid of losing their life, that they always stay safe and never really feel fully alive like that.\n\nI think the thrill-seekers do appreciate life in their own way, because in their mind, to stay safe would be the real waste of a life.\n\nResponse B Author: verumdicetur\n\nResponse B: First what makes you think life is supposed to be appreciated instead of lived? \nSecond, if you don't enjoy life you won't want to keep living? \nThird, only when you face death can you really appreciate life? \nAnd finally fourth, what makes life so important that you need to live in a bubble to appreciate it?\n\nThe answer to these questions is different for each person. \n\nYou have just as good a chance of dying by driving a car. \n\nAlso you have to understand that life is deadly, it kills everyone. So to live in a bubble is a way you can live, but that is probably way to boring for a lot of people. Some people need to feel the adrenaline rush of dangerous actions. Those types of people call that living and your way is just as bad as dying or being in prison. \n\nLong story short, it is an opinion that differs with each person. \n\nThink of it this way, when you play music the point of the music is not to reach the end, the point is to just play.

I believe that this is a step in the right direction, but that it doesn't go far enough. I believe that all people's organs should be made available for donation, if required and healthy, when they die.\n\nI believe this for a few reasons. Firstly, from a purely utilitarian viewpoint, I don't see how we can possibly justify not bringing as much good as possible from someone's death. If someone dies, and someone in the bed next to them requires their liver to be transplanted or they will also die, I don't see how anyone can justify not allowing them to have that liver transplanted into their body. If the shoe were on the other foot, I'm sure they would want that liver.\n\nI don't see how a religious objection can be brought to the table, because what religion would want one of their followers to deny life to another human being if it is in their power to do so?

CMV.\n\n\nResponse A Author: thedude37\n\nResponse A: Well to get to this type of system, you have to look at how you'd answer the question \"Who owns your body?\"  For the state to be able to mandate organ donation, it would have to own your body.  If the state can claim ownership of bodies, it then becomes possible for the state to force people into a lot of different policies, which is not necessarily a good thing at all, if you think about it.\n\nResponse B Author: AsianThunder\n\nResponse B: What gives someone else the right to your property? Your body, even upon death, is still your property just like your physical possessions. You wouldnt want the state to make a law requiring all of your things to go to the state for the greater good, would you? Mandatory organ donation is sure to be challenged, and defeated in court.

How many times can we hear \"I was born free!\" Chevy commercials? Just once I'd like to see Chevy say \"The F150 is a poor choice and here are some complaints from real Ford owners.\" Why is it so taboo for one business to pick on or pick apart their competitors by name?\n\n* This kind of tactic is almost never used in TV/Radio campaigns. Why not?\n* Is there a fear of backlash or starting a war they can't win?\n* Sometimes danced around by saying 'the other guys' or 'brand x'\n* We mostly hear about what's fun, new, delicious, improved, on sale, etc.\n* Why is dissing exclusive to hiphop and political campaigns?\n* I don't see this is as the \"low-road\", but a different tactic.\n* What's wrong with a commercial for XYZ Widgets where people give reasons why \"ABC and LMNOP's widgets really suck!\" ?\n* I'm sure someone can find a few good examples of this, but why should it be uncommon?\n\nResponse A Author: cacheflow\n\nResponse A: Negative advertising is pretty common, but it is mostly relegated to markets where there are only two options (like political campaigns).  Coke and Pepsi have gotten into negative advertising over the years as well (aka the Pepsi Challenge)\n\nIf Chevy makes a commercial about how crappy Ford is, they aren't necessarily convincing you to buy a Chevy.  You could take the message to heart, then buy a Dodge, or a Honda, or any other brand of car.  From Chevy's perspective it makes more sense to talk up a Chevy, rather than try to talk down on all the other possible choices.\n\nResponse B Author: IIIBlackhartIII\n\nResponse B: I think the biggest deterrent would be libel law-suites. If Chevy could honestly back up their claims about how awful a Ford is, they'd probably get away with it, but if not, America is big on suing companies for any little thing, and the multi-year legal expenses of fighting that battle just might not be worth it. \n\nAlso, negative advertising can create a negative mindset. Depending on how they go about it, you could create a poor mood in the consumer. It might be better go about about improving your customer's mood on your own product instead of potentially souring them to car manufacturers in general.\n\nAnd finally, think about how many competitors they'd have to talk down. In a political campaign you've usually only got the 2 major party nominees going head to head. You've got the Republican in one corner, the Democrat in the other... and... *mud slinging contest go!* With a car company, Chevy would have to talk down Ford, and Honda, and Toyota, and Chrysler, and BMW, and Audi, and Cadillac, and Dodge, and Hyundai, and Kia, and Jeep... Negative advertising might put you higher up compared to that one company, but then if a company talks you down, you're in 2nd and your competition is in 3rd, but you're still in 2nd... so yeah.

Often that employee's workload spills over onto his or her co-workers.  \n\nThere are plenty of people who have children who have other arrangements in place and are able to work their full shifts, so clearly there must be some kind of acceptable mechanism in place and there's no reason all working parents can't use it.  \n\nThe excuse that one needs to leave early to save on childcare expenses is not valid.

Again, paying for childcare is part of the burden you accepted when you chose to become a working parent.  \n\nAlso, your kids are tiny friggin' germ factories and your co-workers won't appreciate catching the cold that's going around Mrs. Thompson's 2nd grade class.\n\n\n* **Childless employees are not 'selfish' for demanding equal treatment.**\n\nI would instead argue that the offending parents are selfish for expecting to be treated like special snowflakes because they have a child or children.\n\n\nBeing a childless person and having had to put up with entitled parents considering me to be less of a person than they simply because I haven't popped out a baby, I realize that my view here will be difficult to change, but I would like to have more information so I can form a more well-rounded opinion.  Thanks!\n\n**UPDATE:**  /u/garnteller convinced me that for economic reasons, giving special treatment to parents is the right choice for employers to make.  I am still not convinced that they morally SHOULD do this.\n\n\nResponse A Author: garnteller\n\nResponse A: The the employers who decide how employees are treated or what benefits they receive. Guess what - they have realized that they \"should\" give them special treatment.\n\n* It doesn't generally cost them more\n* Parents need the job more than non-parents.  They are more likely to favor security over money or opportunity.\n* They don't want to be at a competitive disadvantage in hiring and retaining workers if other companies have more liberal policies\n* Generally, reasonable flexibility results in greater loyalty and engagement from the workers.  If you feel you are being treated well, you work harder.\n* You don't hear very often of childless workers asking HR about the company's family policy so they can avoid the ones with liberal policies\n* The vast majority of workers will have kids at some point, so it evens out eventually.\n\nIt makes complete sense for the employer- that's why they do it.\n\nResponse B Author: Russian_Surrender\n\nResponse B: Here's the thing.  For many people (me included), once they have children, the family and time with the family becomes much more important that the job.  Depending upon the job, the family can be more important by orders of magnitude.\n\nSo give the choice between \"missing family time\" or \"getting fired\", there are many, many situation where these people would choose \"getting fired\".  I'm not missing Christmas morning with my 4 year old.  If my employer doesn't like that, go ahead and fire me.  Same goes for basically anything that is highly important to my child (and that importance is reasonable).\n\nSo I'm not sure that what you're seeing is necessarily \"special treatment\".  What you're seeing is \"this employee is important to me and the success of my business, and I will make the accommodations necessary to have that employee continue working for me\".  Those accommodations are *different* for single employees and employees with families, but they both have accommodations.  Single people, for example, may get away with being a little more sluggish and hungover on Friday mornings because they're more likely to be out partying on Thursday night than their married-with-children counterparts.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author garnteller's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Their payments never stop.  They can't save for retirement or afford to send kids to college. All that money they spend on shelter just evaporates (goes to the landlord). With rent abolished, they start making mortgage payments, and after 15years, they stop paying. Now they can save and send their kids to college and help their kids buy homes. Their children have children and sell the original family home, allowing the grandparents to pass on the value they invested to their grandkids, so the grandkids can buy homes and send *their* kids to college. \n\nNow imagine everyone doing this. No one gets obscenely wealthy and no one is able to draw merely passive income, but everyone has a home and land within their family. Within three generations we can solve a great many economic and social problems, all by eliminating rent. Our society must stop feeding off itself by chasing some elusive (and immoral) dream of passive income through control of property.\n\n(1) **Should we outlaw Renting?

I don't understand how people are even able to pay their rent... Most of the rent people pay us goes toward our mortgages, the rest goes into repairs. All we do is shuffle money around. We don't realy add any value to the system, and I hate it... If you want to change things, look at laws concerning home building. Eliminate restrictions... superfluous requirements and you'll see cheap housing start to appear. You'll put my family business out of business, but everyone will be better off, including me. I'll get a basic income too.\"\n\n\n*****\n\n#**Minarchist Libertarian Government**\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, I will give the Wikipedia definition:\n\n*\"Minarchism (also known as minimal statism) is a political philosophy. It is variously defined by sources. In the strictest sense, it holds that states ought to exist (as opposed to anarchy), that their only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from aggression, theft, breach of contract, and fraud, and that the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military, police, and courts. In the broadest sense, it also includes fire departments, prisons, the executive, and legislatures as legitimate government functions. Such states are generally called 'night-watchman' states.*\n\n*Minarchists argue that the state has no authority to use its monopoly of force to interfere with free transactions between people, and see the state's sole responsibility as ensuring that contracts between private individuals and property are protected, through a system of law courts and enforcement. Minarchists generally believe a laissez-faire approach to the economy is most likely to lead to economic prosperity.\"*\n\nThis would mean that some bare minimum of appropriate taxes would still need to be collected to fund the minimum level of government necessary to ensure the above mentioned services, along with a Basic Income. (I consider this a \"necessary evil\".) This also means that the courts would no longer enforce or hold legitimate any Rental agreements (just as one could not sell themselves into \"voluntary slavery\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*****\n\nI know this is a *HUGE* post with a lot of assertions, but I hope to get some great responses based on the voluminous fodder for discussion.

I've seen a million studies that show men make less. And I've seen a million studies that show everyone makes about the same.\n\n\nI think every study that shows that one gender makes more than the other is incomplete or fallacious, and I strongly believe that most studies are done by people who are looking for a particular outcome to prove what they already hope to be true.\n\n\nWhen considering all aspects of employment (wages, hours worked, benefits, experience, occupation, and anything else that could be a factor) I seriously believe that men and women probably make a very similar number; a number so similar that there are no grounds for advocating either gender needs more pay. I am equally willing to believe that men make less money as I am to believe women make less money.\n\n\nResponse A Author: Codeine_the_Unicorn\n\nResponse A: I think that you are confusing two separate sets of data. The studies that show that women earn \"77 cents to every man's dollar\" are talking about lifetime gross earnings. Basically, this is saying that a woman will, on average, make about 3/4 of what a man makes over the course of her entire lifetime. It's taking into consideration things like job growth potential, raises, promotions, etc. \n\nWhat these studies *don't* say is that if a man and a woman are both working next to each other in an office, the man gets a higher paycheck for the same job. That type of blatant micro-level sexism is not what the data shows. I'm sure that there are some employers that would pay a woman less, but there are also legal protections in place to attempt to correct this. \n\nThis data really points to a larger macro-level, structural imbalance--women being passed up for promotions, executive positions, etc. \n\nSo, in a way, you are correct. Men and women doing the same job for the same company probably do make very similar wages. The issue, however, becomes apparent over long stretches of time and large sample sizes.\n\n\n\nFor further sources, please see:\n\nhttp://www.ijull.co.uk/vol7/2/thomson.pdf\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/aug/31/cmi-equal-pay-report\n\nhttp://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf\n\nhttp://social.dol.gov/blog/myth-busting-the-pay-gap/\n\nI very much understand that there are flaws with the \"77 cents\" figure (as with any point of data). I still firmly hold, however, that whether we want to say that the wage gap is 77%, 90% or even 99.9%, that is an issue that needs to be systemically corrected. \n\nResponse B Author: Qender\n\nResponse B: \nThis is actually a fallacy. There are ZERO studies that show everyone makes the same. All studies show that women earn less. There are however many very convincing \"opinion columns\" and articles written by conservatives that  blame the wage gap on \"women's choices\" such as preferring to work fewer hours or different careers. While those reasons are a part of the wage gap, they are just a part, and in reality, a large portion of the differences in hours worked and job position is caused by employer discrimination in hiring and promotions. Not to mention, saying \"Women earn less because they make different choices\" does not mean women don't earn less, it means they do. They just have other pressures that interfere with them earning what men do.\n\n\nThat's how \"reports\" and opinion columns work. Not science. Scientific studies prove that women earn 77% of what men do on average, and that EVEN when accounting for the differences like job position and hours worked, the average woman earns 7% less than a man with an identical position, hours, education, and experience.\n\n\nNo, for identical job positions, hours worked, experience, and occupation. Women earn about 7% less. On top of that, consider that things like differences in job position are a mechanism by which discrimination causes women to be paid less. I.E. Many companies prefer to hire men for high paying positions instead of women, or prefer to give raises and promotions to men, causing women to be paid less in a way that appears to be explained by \"differences in job position\"\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Codeine_the_Unicorn's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Some employers will have a PTO bank for vacation days, another one for sick days, another one for personal days, and another for floating holidays.  There's a lot of reasons I think this is worse than using a single combined PTO bank.\n\n*  The employee will have trouble calculating how much time is available to them.  If the employer requires PTO to be used in 8 hour chunks, the actual amount of PTO available may be different from the *useable* amount of PTO available.\n\n*  Accounting on the employer side is complicated as there are going to be multiple ways of accounting for an employee's day off.\n\n*  The various PTO banks usually accrue at different rates, which makes it hard to estimate how much time off you will have in the future.\n\n*  The various PTO banks usually have different rules for how much time can be accumulated and whether or not it rolls over from year to year, as well as how much can roll over each year.\n\n*  It encourages employees to lie, which is bad for employee morale and bad for the company.  It's better to know Fred will not be in a week ahead of time than for him to fake sick the morning of.\n\n*  It's disingenuous to offer a sick bank as employers typically act like it's the same as vacation time when hiring you, but it's only supposed to be available if you are sick.  I once was offered to leave a job with 3 weeks PTO (all one bank) for a job with 3 weeks PTO (1 week vacation, 2 weeks sick) and the recruiter tried to claim that it was just a semantic difference.  In reality to use those 2 weeks I'd have to actually be sick, or lie about it.  And even if I did lie about it, I couldn't use more than a day or two at a time, unlike vacation time.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: patval\n\nResponse A: I think the idea between having different kind of paid days off  is to help employees be happier, thanks to being able to take the right time off without having to lie or feel bad.\n\nVacation days are to be planned. This is the main time off. The fact that it's planned gives you some time to organize a nice time off, far away from the office, which is necessary for your mental health and work efficiency.\n\nThen, sick days, as illustrated by down42roads, is to send the message that the company understands that everyone gets sick once in a while, and that you don't have to worry about that. You're sick, too tired to work well and potentially contagious: stay at home without having to take on your planned vacation time nor to be less paid. Of course, don't be dishonest and use sick days if you're not sick. The company is not telling you to be out for a certain amount of days every year where you could be sick, it's just telling you that they understand if you're sick and respect it.\n\nPersonal days. Still not touching on your planned vacation, the company understands that shit happens.. and repairmen don't particularly enjoy working at night, nor do delivery companies. We hope you don't order 32 sofas and washing machine every year that require you to stay at home to wait for the delivery guy, but once in a while, you need some time, like everyone, to wait for some guy, or arrange some personal issue... and the company can understand that. Again, it's not about \"you should take that may days off that are due to you\", it's really \"without touching your vacation, we understand you have some personal duties that can require that you take half a day or a day of sometimes, so we make it easy for you, to show you that we like you and hope you are happy to work with us.\n\nIf you transform all that into a common pool, then people will simply try to take more vacations, then when they're sick, they will be unhappy as they'll think they're taking on their vacation time, which is not the intent, and same for their personal issues to fix during the day. \n\nThat's why I think those 3 types of days away from the office should not be taken from the same pool.\n\nResponse B Author: natha105\n\nResponse B: I think the real problem is that there shouldn't be paid sick day \"pools\".  Being sick is a contingent event that you can't plan for and should be accommodated by the employer to every reasonable degree.  Some people have been with a company five years and never taken a sick day.  Others get a serious illness in their first year and take two weeks off.  IF people were honest about needing time off for legitimate illnesses I don't see why sick time ought to be limited, banked, etc.\n\nThe reason companies have these different banks with rules on them is because people are dirty liars.  If you give us five sick days a year we will use the five days (unless we can \"bank\" them with the expectation of a future benefit).  If you let us take sick days as vacation days we will come to work sick to get the vacation time.  We game the system every which way we can and creating these different banks is just an attempt to reduce fraud.

Then again, I consider myself pretty open minded, so I'd like to hear the other side on this issue.\n\nResponse A Author: Dimebow\n\nResponse A: It would be nice to see you elaborate more on your opinions. Specifically, what is your meaning of the word natural? By definition, homosexuality is perfectly natural and can be found all over nature. \n\nYou use the word \"purpose\" implying that there are set rules to the human body and what we can do with it. If you're implying that we should be purely focussed on survival and reproduction, then a population census with ensure you we're not having any problem with this, so I believe we can be fairly slack on the whole ordeal. If you're implying that we have been \"built\" by some higher power for said purpose, then please explain your beliefs on this.\n\nBy stating that you think homosexuality is a mental illness, are you saying you believe it is something that should be cured? If so, why?\n\nI would finally like to know why you propose grouping homosexuality with paedophilia and incest, when the circumstances and repercussions of each of them are so different? A homosexual relationship is purely consensual and carries none of the problems of reproduction via incest (though personally I hold no problem against purely consensual relationships between relatives).\n\nThank you for coming with an open mind, and I hope you re-evaluate your stance on the matter.\n\nResponse B Author: Eh_Priori\n\nResponse B: You have a misunderstanding of what is natural and why that is relevant to this issue. Yes the human body has developed with a specific purpose, that purpose is not to reproduce but to ensure the survival of our genes. Hence homosexuality could be a natural advantage in that a homosexual individual with no children of their own is better able to help care and protect their neices and nephews, who share similar genes to the homosexual. Also, something being natural does not automatically make it good, and something being unnatural does not automatically make it wrong. (Consider: rape is a natural mating strategy, but it definitly is not morally right) \n\nYou also ignore relevant differences between homosexuality, pedophilia and incest that effect why we think homosexuality should not be sanctioned but pedophilia and incest should. The relevant difference with pedophilia is that children cannot give consent, whilst incest between parents and their chilren (including adult children) involves a power differential in the same way a teacher-student sexual relationship does. Homosexual relationships do not by definition include non-consenting individuals or power differentials (although some of them certainly can have these features). And yes I realise I haven't excluded sibling incest because to be honest the only reason I can see as to why this should be sanctioned is because of the genetic risk to potential children, so I guess if they use preventative measures its ok.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Dimebow's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: Alright, I think it's time that I had a proper discussion about this. **I firmly believe that the decision to move Iraq, the Middle East, and the region into a post-Saddam Hussein era was a moral and legal imperative for the United States and the international community and that force of arms was the only feasible way to accomplish that.** That's my position, in a sentence. I hope the post title doesn't misrepresent that.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1) There are four reasons for which a sovereign state may lose or sacrifice its sovereignty under international law.\n\n* It has invaded or occupied a neighboring state.\n* It has violated or proposed to violate the Genocide Convention\n* It has displayed promiscuous and frivolous behavior with (or plainly violated) the Non-Proliferation Treaty\n* It has actively harbored internationally wanted terrorists and gangsters\n\nIraq is the only modern state to have violated all four of those. It had attempted to annex Kuwait and make it part of Iraq, as well as engage in a pointless border dispute with Iran that cost thousands of lives. Saddam had issued a direct order to exterminate the Kurdish people of Iraq. He did this using biological and chemical weapons. Further, he maintained a department of state for the concealment of nuclear weapons. Although none were found during the invasion, he had stated that he wished to rebuild the nuclear program once the sanctions ceased. Finally, his country was the homebase of Abu-Nidal, Zarqawi, and the Achille Lauro hijackers from the PLF. \n\nThis meant that the international community had a duty, as well as a right, to remove the regime from power by any justifiable means, including and up to use of deadly force.\n\n2) Saddam Hussein and his crime family had sole ownership of all of the natural resources and imports to Iraq. The sanctions were in effect because he was able to use his power to keep the Iraqi people in his jaws, while they starved. Furthermore, he was in possession of some of the largest oil reserves in the world. He was able to do as he liked with them, and he was the sole profiteer of them. This was, in my opinion, an outrageous offense to anyone who cared about the economic well-being of both the country and the Middle East as a whole.\n\n3) Saddam Hussein only ever called a cabinet meeting when he ordered one half of the cabinet to shoot the other half, sealing them in complicity with his regime. A person could be publicly executed for spilling their coffee on the newspaper that had Saddam's face on it, after which the person's family would be billed for the bullets. People died horrible deaths every day for no other reason than the egotistical glorification of a known psychopath and criminal. Morally, an international community that had any regard for decency could not stand by while this regime behaved like that.\n\nNote: this is **not** an endorsement of the Bush administration. I believe wholly that their execution of the war was abysmal. Their reasons as stated to the American electorate were appallingly cheap and demagogic. They didn't level with us on any of the goings-on in the war while it was happening. They may have even committed a war crime or two. But, that isn't what this question is about.\n\nThis question is not about 9/11. My case would have been exactly the same in 1998 (with the exception of Zarqawi, I believe). In fact, it would have been almost complete during the Kuwait War. This question is not about mistakes that were made. It's solely about whether we, as citizens of a global community, were willing to stand by with our guns holstered while our Iraqi brothers and sisters were under the control of the Saddam Hussein regime.\n\nCMV.\n\n\n1) Some of you guys have had the best arguments I've yet heard against my position. Definitely the best on reddit. I'm gonna keep coming back here, for sure, and not just for my own post. Thank you, sincerely, and keep them coming.\n\n2) Having said that, I feel the need to make something abundantly clear: my contention is not \"America has made nothing but good foreign policy decisions ever since the Declaration\". It's also not \"Bush did the right thing during his execution of the war\". It's also not \"Bush Sr. was right\". It's also not \"Bush Sr. was wrong\". It's not \"X politician made Y statement and that proves me right\". I'm very deliberately **making my own case**, separate from any case anybody else made. I'm serious: if I get one more post that starts with \"BUT BUSH SAID...\" I'm going to go all Bane-backbreaker on my laptop.\n\n3) But seriously, keep it up.\n\n4) &lt;3\n\n5) Also, I'm going to bed right now.

But being an engineer, I just want to focus on the technology. I need someone to handle running the business side of things. I've got a friend I've worked with for years. Our different skills complement each other nicely, we have well established channels of communication, and I know she'll be a great business manager or my start up. Do I need to post an opening and go through a standard process, or can I enlist my friend?\n\nSix months into our start up, I can't handle the engineering work alone. My background is software, and there's a hardware component that needs an experienced circuit designer. I know a guy who eats, sleeps, and breathes circuit design. We worked on several projects together in college, and I know I can trust him to get the job done quickly and do high quality work. Do I need to post an opening and go through a standard process, or can I hire my old classmate?\n\nNow we're looking to crowd fund the mass production of our product, and we need a good video for Kickstarter. My co-founder's neighbor does video for an advertising firm, and we've looked around enough to know that they've offered us a competitive rate. Do we need to shop more of the market, or can we use my co-founder's neighbor?\n\nAs mass production kicks off, I put the circuit designer in charge of QA/QC for the produced units. He can't test enough units on his own. He could use an extra hand, but feels making a bad hire would be worse than doing it all himself. He's got an old colleague that is experienced in hardware QA/QC, and happens to be available for six months. Can we hire the colleague who is a known quantity, or should we just punt on hiring anyone because it would be faster for the circuit designer to do it himself than go through a rigorous hiring process?\n\nAt what point do your rules against networking kick in? I don't think anyone would seriously suggest that someone looking to found a start up should have to dig through a pile of applicants to choose a co-founder. I would also hope that a start up's first technical hire could be someone the founders have a reason to trust. And I see a line manager growing his team as a microcosm of a founder growing his company, though the company may have rules in place to help keep the line managers from going off the reservation. Do your rules only apply to big companies? If so, how big are we talking? Finally, do you apply the same rules to hiring out business services? When we hired that advertising company to make our Kickstarter video, were we breaking the networking rules?\n\nResponse B Author: themcos\n\nResponse B: I feel like your view is painting \"networking\" with an overly broad brush. Networking can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, but certainly no one is defending outright nepotism (let's just give the job to my cousin because reasons). The details of the hiring process also can vary heavily by industry. Some things I want to point out:\n\nHiring can be extremely expensive. If via the \"standard process\", a company gets a thousand applications for an open position, with many if not most of the candidates being total garbage, going through this volume of resumes can be a herculean task. Given the inputs (thousands of applicants) and the desired outputs (hire one person), its awfully hard for me to imagine a paradigm where you're not allowed to short-list a candidate who you have good reason to believe is a strong candidate. Whatever benefits to social mobility you think such a hypothetical paradigm shift would bring, I hope you at least acknowledge what a massive burden this would be.\n\nI think you also need to acknowledge how subtle \"networking\" can be. Certain forms seem benign to the point of it being absurd to try to regulate them. At any given point, there's a pool of applicants and a pool of jobs. But not all applicants can apply to every job, and sometimes potential applicants may not even be looking. Also, not only are some applicants bad fits for certain jobs, but some jobs are bad fits for certain applicants. Even if \"networking\" is just the employer telling the applicant about the *existence* of a job opening that they think would be a good fit has huge effects, without any kind of \"short list\" stuff (although at this point if they stop there, the company is probably knowingly wasting a ton of time and money with their  \"weed out\" process on a candidate that they already are pretty sure will at least get an interview). Are you advocating that even this level of networking be discouraged?\n\nLastly, I'm skeptical that \"reducing networking\" will necessarily even help your goals. Although you talk about the cliche schmoozing at networking events style stuff, in my experience real world networking is one of the purest forms of meritocracies out there, as its based very directly on real world performance. But when you fall back to any kind of \"standard process\", I think you underestimate the extent to which such systems can be in a sense \"gamed\" by having the \"right\" sort of resume. And like networking, understanding how the \"standard\" process works and can be manipulated is a skill that is going to be disproportionately found in upper class applicants. Meanwhile now you're *removing* an avenue by which less advantaged applicants who have already proven themselves and built professional relationships to stand out as the excellent applicants they are.\n\ntl;dr - Hiring is really hard. Even very subtle and benign forms of networking can have major positive benefits for both employer and applicant. Forcing all applicants through a \"standard process\" might make the problem you're trying to solve worse, not better.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author AusIV's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

The laws are suppose to be written so that any company that is caught breaking the law will face consequences that far outweigh the benefits gained from breaking said law.  Unfortunately this is not how is works in the real world.\n\nOne thing to realize, is that the person who makes the decision to break the law can be held criminally and financially responsible for the crime.  Again, in the real world, this isn't always the case, but it is enough to remove the fiduciary duty.\n\nWhen doing a cost benefit analysis you always need to factor in the risk of something occurring, in this case getting caught.  Breaking the law may be profitable if a company can get away with it for a year, but what are the chances of getting caught in the first year, or even first month?\n\nAnd let's not forget that the costs aren't always simply paying a fine, it may include restitution, punitive damages, criminal charges, loss of enrichment, and loss of public goodwill. \n\nSo let's make up an example.\n\nLet's say you run a company that makes rims for cars.  You sell both to the after market and directly to the manufacturers.  \n\nOne day you come up with a scheme to import cheap aluminium from North Korea.  You do the math, and by importing from North Korea, you will save $5 million a year.  You also look into the fine, and it's only $500,000.  \n\nSo let's say you make it one full year before you are caught.  Right away the government slaps you with the fine.  Then when word gets out, all of the manufacturers drop you, and take you to court for the unjust enrichment of selling them North Korean aluminium and on top of that, the after market shops don't want to deal with you, unless you drop your prices significantly.  And there still could be criminal charges for doing business with an enemy of America. \n\nOn top of this, the share price drops, because many people don't want to hold stock in a company that deals with North Korea.\n\nSo not only have you fucked over the share holders, you have also put yourself at risk of losing your freedom.\n\nThis was a very simple example.  There are many other cases where breaking the law can have some much more serious drawbacks, like manslaughter charges, loss of the ability to do business, major environmental clean ups,  or even violence against the company.\n\nThe laws should be written in a way, and enforcement should be adequate, that breaking the law is clearly not in the best interest of the share holders, and would not be the fiduciary duty of the executives. \n\nResponse B Author: DerekReinbold\n\nResponse B: This is a very narrow way of looking at the type of cost-benefit analyses that a corporation may make. Direct profit vs. fines are not the only angle that this can/should be approached from. Take the current example of GM and its ignition switches. Clearly, they employed a limited form of cost-benefit analysis and decided not to recall the cars. They are facing penalties now for doing so. Fine. That's what you are talking about. But what about the negative publicity they are receiving, what about the possible thousands of consumers that will be turned away from their products in this and coming years because they feel they cannot trust the manufacturer. This is a logical thing for a customer to include in his/her consideration of what automobile to buy. Why, then, would a corporation not include this in its cost-benefit analysis?\n\nWhat I'm saying is, the consequences of breaking the law/doing the \"wrong\" thing are not always strictly fine-based. Company reputation matters, and may tilt the scales in favor of good behavior in some/many cases.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author TheShadowCat's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I've seen it happen and it works out great.\n\n* IVF is insanely expensive. And why force nature's hand when there are simpler alternatives? And from what I understand, it's not a 100% guarantee it would even work on top of that.\n\n* Studies have shown that couples love their adopted child the same as their own \"flesh-and-blood\" child. Adoption even exists in the animal kingdom among some species. So I don't buy the \"but some people want to have 'their own flesh and blood child'\" argument, because all I hear from that is that you're incredibly vain.\n\n* In an age where scientists have suggested that \"survival of the fittest\" doesn't apply to humans anymore, in the sense that we have medical science and no longer live in the jungle being chased by lions / dinosaurs, what is the advantage in passing on your own DNA? And even then, if you're infertile, isn't your DNA already faulty enough that you shouldn't pass it on, according to nature, so to speak?\n\nI don't mean to be harsh or judgmental, I simply have not come across a compelling argument for IVF that makes reasonable sense to me. So please CMV, thanks!\n\n(This is also my first post here, please forgive me if I have committed any error / broken rules).\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: You disagree with the argument that people might expect their genes to be superior - ok. But what about the environment that the kid is raised in - which depends on how old they are when you adopt. Even if you get a newborn (which are often very expensive, and require going on a waiting list of 3-5 years), they still spent 9 months in someone else's womb. You can't be sure that the birth mother followed a great diet, didn't smoke or drink, weren't playing action sports the week before delivery - whatever. I believe that wanting to *ensure* that your child has a superior environment from fertilization on is a good enough reason for a couple wanting to try IVF over adoption.  \n\nResponse B Author: matthewrozon\n\nResponse B: 1. Why is it moral for someone to have their own kids and not adopt but it's immoral for someone who can't have kids?\n\n2. International adoption is WAY more expensive than IVF with the average sitting around 25k. Also, a lot of insurances cover fertility procedures and in my province they are covered by the government\n\n3. It's not 100% that you can become an adoptive parent, and it takes years. If you're still concerned about money, a lot of IVF procedures give a certain percentage back if it's not successful, or offer then second attempt free\n\n4. No one is denying that adopting is a great thing to do. What I don't get is why it's not vain for someone fertile to have kids, but as soon as you have a medical problem, you're an asshole for not adopting.\n\n5. Not even going to address your appeal to nature, which is a fallacy by the way. You can use survival of the fittest to justify killing off 50% of the population but it's not smart\n\nThe compelling reasons for IVF are that people are sick and we have medicine for it, who cares what their reason is for not adopting. Basically if you think that it's ok for fertile people to procreate over adopting you should think IVF is ok.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author [deleted]'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

We didn't have much and lived on the third floor of an apartment that we later learned was the local drug house. Even though for us going out for a meal was extremely rare, she instilled in us that you were supposed to tip when you got good service.

But no one raises the obvious issue which is buried right in your comment: \"tip for good service.\" Do Black people generally receive the same quality of service as others? \n\nGiven the discriminatory history of commercial eating establishments (eg think lunch counter sit-ins, Denny's, Cracker Barrel), the well known anti-Black implicit bias here in the US[0], and now this often repeated \"Blacks don't tip\" stereotype I think it is highly probable that Black people do not receive the same quality of service and are therefore right to be at the very least ambivalent about tipping. Those issues actually put the burden of proof on anyone who thinks Blacks are given equitable service and simply don't tip due to moral failings.\n\nI'd say tip what you feel is appropriate but do not let this be a burden on yourself. Don't let it be another tax that you as a Black have to pay for being Black.\n\n[0] Not related to tipping but last week I read about Black people not even getting basic courtesy and concern for safety when crossing the street.

It's ok, but it is your duty to acknowledge that and to fight against it.\n\nOP, we black people are not inferior, some of us tip and some of us don't.

I'm not really viewing this from the outside in, though perhaps that perspective is what I need.\n\nI'm nineteen years old now, coming to realization with my sexuality when I had just turned thirteen years old. I was a loner who read, wrote, and gamed in my spare time rather than hang out with friends. People instantly expected me to talk with a lisp, walk with a strut, and love shopping. People equated me to being a 'gay best friend' on merit of that. It caused me to feel like this was the only way it was socially acceptable.\n\nI feel like endorsing this behavior, through the media, and equating it with being gay is harmful. For one, it's feeding the anti-gay fire. Covering yourself in penises, being out-of-the-norm for the sake of being out of the norm, and basically acting as freakish as possible could give otherwise on-the-fence people a bad impression. Instead of this exposure giving light to a serious issue (Recognizing that people who have an attraction to the same gender as equal, as the same as you), it just draws an association that being gay = being this annoying, immature stereotype. I've been in more than one situation where, for example, someone's watching television, a fast-talking, lispy, effeminate man comes on and is met with \"Damn faggots.\"\n\nI recognize that there are bigots who will hate/dislike/not accept homosexuality no matter what. But acting in this manner simplifies the issue, and allows people to assign x to y, taking a lot of gravity and maturity away from any moving forward.\n\nOn another note, if this is legitimately your personality, I don't think you should have to conform. But associating it with your sexuality on such a consistent basis (Talking like a gay guy, walking like a gay guy, dressing like a gay guy) isn't a good thing to do. This should instead be quantified as \"That's just how John acts\".\n\nI feel the best way to make progress is to... act like normal, productive members of society, or rather act like yourself, instead of a freak of nature. Protest in manners that aren't disgusting to people of a weaker disposition.\n\nTL;DR The typical gay stereotype makes gay people look like 'pets', or second-class, and destroys progress towards equality.\n\n\nResponse A Author: cold08\n\nResponse A: \nWho says it isn't legitimately part of their personality? Our personality is largely shaped by our environment.\n\nYou are lucky that you live in a time when you can tell people you're gay and not lose your friends, job and family. You can have a relationship out in the open like anyone else. I'm in my 30's and it boggles my mind that enough social pressure has disappeared to be straight that a 13 year old can look at himself and accept that he is gay. I'm not saying it was easy for you, just way easier than it was for gay people a few decades ago.\n\nIt wasn't too long ago that people like you could only be gay in porn shops, bath houses and gay clubs and everywhere else they had to pretend to be straight. Those places developed their own culture. They made their own uniforms and stereotypes and ways for others in the community to recognize them.\n\nThey adopted the personality of the only community where they were safe. Of my gay friends, the younger ones that had supportive communities usually subscribe to most American cultural norms. It's the older ones and the ones that grew up afraid of anyone finding out where they had to abandon their entire community to be themselves that tend to be more stereotypical because they sought out a community they knew would accept them.\n\nYou'll see gay culture slowly go away as they're more accepted, but it's unfair to put hurting the movement on those people that were so scared of being found out.\n\nResponse B Author: hippiechan\n\nResponse B: \nThey're acting like themselves. They're not negatively impacting gay rights by acting like themselves, unless people like you look at them as a 'burden' and not as part of the diversity of the LGBT community. Chances are, if someone is opposed to LGBT rights already, an absence of flamboyant gay men isn't going to change their mind.

CMV.\n\nOp: I am playing through pokemon white for the third time and I've noticed that several of the gym leaders are easily defeated by one pokemon. For instance, I just demolished Brycen in Icirrus City with a decently leveled (higher level than two, lower level than the third) Darmation. I didn't even have to heal before reaching the leader, it was so easy. I remember back in Pokemon Red, each gym leader created a different challenge because there were only a few ways to genuinely crush the leaders because they were exactly that: leaders in their various gym types. Brock was a tough match because if you picked Charmander, only Butterfree was strong and diverse enough to take down the megalith that was Onyx. Same with Misty, you had yet to encounter electric pokemon so you had to crush her water/psychic types creatively, with a high level grass pokemon. It forced your team to be diverse, and it forced your game plan to be multifaceted. I have Darmation with a grass move, two fire types and one fighting type move and he basically crushes any foes I encounter. \n\nAlso, the fighting types are massive forces in this game because they had to dumb down psychics and dark type pokemon. \n\n\nSo reddit, CMV!\n\n\n\nMy original complaint is my average leveled, easily obtained pokemon crushed an entire gym leader by himself. \n\nAlso, I'm willing to argue that pokemon is no longer marketed towards children, but is marketed towards the adults who played as kids. I am around quite a few kids and most of them (anecdotal, I know) are interested in other things. \n\nResponse A Author: skulder7\n\nResponse A: I don't know about you, but six-year-old me rampaged through Pokemon Red with what ended up being a level 94 Blastoise.\n\nIf you're actually using any strategy, gym leaders in Pokemon are trivial. They ALL (with one interesting, but not particularly difficult exception) specialize in one type. That one type will have several weaknesses, and at least one of those will likely be shared by every Pokemon in the gym by necessity. Also, at least one of the Pokemon available before that gym (and likely a few) will have a good move that is strong against that gym. THIS IS GOOD GAME DESIGN. The alternative is to have nothing strong against the gym, and have to grind up mediocre mons instead of using strategy in the battle.\n\nBrock was, in the case of Charmander-Choosers, BAD GAME DESIGN. There was nothing Charmander could do against Brock until a reasonably high level, and most of the other Pokemon you could catch before Brock were equally useless. Note that in Yellow version, they added Mankeys and gave Nidoran Double Kick, and in FireRed, they let Charmander learn Metal Claw (super-effective against Rock types) at level 13. Not being able to use good strategies is not a good kind of difficulty.\n\nMisty was not quite as bad because you were given the ability to catch grass types before her. Hell, I'd argue that she was the best gym leader because she was difficult for all three starters to some degree. Water attacks hit Charmander, Confusion hurt Bulbasaur, and Squirtle wasn't very effective against her, while she could hit Squirtle neutrally with Confusion. \n\nGood difficulty in a pokemon game shouldn't be caused by needing grinding, but it also shouldn't be caused by being denied the tools to fight gym leaders. \n\nFinally, the difficulty in Pokemon battles doesn't come from type combos or move match-ups. When you're playing real players, everyone has a rough idea not to leave a Parasect in against a Charizard. The interesting difficulty here comes from the mind games and battle plans you have to set up against the opposing player, which Pokemon AI cannot yet execute effectively. \n\nThe real point of gym leaders in pokemon games is to try to expose players to different types of Pokemon, not provide a significant challenge. An electric gym will showcase the best electric types in the region, and a rock gym will show off the coolest rock types. Note that it is very common for players to be able to catch the same pokemon gym members use in either the area directly before, or the area directly after the gym. Since every Pokemon is usable to beat the game, it lets players discover and use only their favorites.\n\nThe other real reason for gyms is to try (emphasis on try, because a sufficiently leveled starter can tank the whole game) to force players to diversify their teams. Bringing a fire starter to the water gym? You're gonna have a bad time, unless you catch some of the electric and grass types conveniently outside of town.\n\nTL;DR - No matter what, Pokemon against an AI is going to be easy (and at best, difficult in a way that can be solved by grinding). The goal of gyms isn't really to provide a challenge, but to promote players to try different pokemon.\n\nResponse B Author: Thoctar\n\nResponse B: Ironically, I find Gen 1 to be one of the easiest because of terrible AI, I mean look at Twitchplayspokemon and Venomoth taking down Dragonite. Gen 3 would have had the same difficulty for the first gym if it wasn't for Combusken's double kick, and I find Brawly to be more difficult than Misty. I think that Black and White 2 had a good difficulty level, mostly as a reaction to Black and White which were some of the easiest. But I think a lot of that stems from your experience. Remember, these are new games when they come out, designed for casual players. Yes they have some people who come back a lot, but quite a significant portion won't know EVERYTHING about the game, even former players playing a new generation. Thus, I think that for quite a lot of players, even given a type advantage, if they even have a pokemon of that type, will not necessarily always sweep an entire gym. Gym leaders tend to have better AI, especially in later generations, than traditional trainers, as well as better pokemon, and even with type advantages they can still put up a good fight. With a lot of games if you know everything about them they're easy, but I think a lot of players find gym leaders to be a reasonable challenge, kids or not. I even know some people who could never finished BW2 because of the difficulty increase.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author skulder7's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

The status symbols change over time, but the existence of status symbols doesn't. \n\nThere was a time, say in the 18th century, where the elite would wear quite elaborate clothing. Check out this picture of [Louis XIV](http://www.paradoxplace.com/Photo%20Pages/France/France_History/Images/Louis-XIV-BAR800.jpg). He's dressing in elaborate, fantastical clothing to tell everyone, \"look how rich and powerful I am. I can afford to waste resources on immense amounts of expensive fabric.\" \n\nNowadays, you would never see a wealthy leader dressing like this. Clothes have become cheap, thus they are no longer useful as a status symbol. Certain elite brands are used to show off wealth, but the suit the president wears is little different in form than the suit you can buy down at Walmart. His suit is just higher quality and better fitted.\n\nOr consider beauty standards. Back during the Victorian Era, it was very fashionable for women of class to have extremely pale skin. When most of the populace lived on farms or walked to work in a factory, most people got tan quite easily. Only the rich could afford to be pale. Nowadays, where most people work office jobs, retail jobs, food service, etc, tanning is a luxury good, a sign you have enough spare time to sit in the sun or money to go to a tanning salon.\n\nSo, what would the luxury goods be for a post-scarcity society? In such a society, the cost of most physical goods would approach zero. Raw materials would be extracted by robots. Energy would come from cheap robot-produced solar farms. Robots would assemble and repair other robots. The cost of most physical goods, in a true post-scarcity society, is near zero. Sure, a common laborer could buy a thousand copies of a 2015 Lexus, but what's the point? Even someone working at Burger King could afford to put together a copy of Louis XIV's outfit, but no one ever does. It's just seen as silly and ridiculous, possibly even a sign of mental illness.\n\nSo, what would rich people spend their money on? What are the status goods of post-scarcity society? Well, real estate could certainly be one. The cost to build a house may be zero, but land certainly isn't. Still, this can be ameliorated by high-rises. Lots of people can afford to live in a ritzy downtown area if a high-quality high rise can be built to next for nothing. Owning a single-family home in a high-quality area would be a status symbol, but just living their wouldn't.\n\nSo, without that, what do we have? About the only thing you can buy with your money at that point is human-intensive services. Sure, you *could* use a robot to clean your house, but do you want people to think you are poor? Show off your wealth by hiring a butler instead. You *could* put your kid through a MOOC to teach them algebra, but you're better than that. Hire an expensive private tutor instead. You *could* have a robot do your hair or nails, but really? What are you, a common peasant? Pay for the fancy salon instead and show off your fabulous wealth. You *could* use a driverless car, but having someone drive you around is just so much more classy. \n\nIn short, in a world where the cost of physical goods is near zero, the only way to show off your wealth is to hire a bunch of people as a status symbol.\n\nSo, what does retain \n\nResponse B Author: TryUsingScience\n\nResponse B: Bill Gates is one of the wealthiest people in the world and he devotes a substantial portion of his wealth to philanthropy.

I know this is considered tabboo to many people, but here are my views:\n\n* **Why I prefer well-done steak**: First of all, by well done, I mean brown all the way through, which is not the same as completely burned so that the steak resembles a hockey puck in appearance and flavor. I have had some phenomenal steaks cooked well done at moderate-to-upscale steakhouses, and the outside was barely charred at all. After trying steaks cooked to a variety of temperatures, I feel that well done is the best according to my tastes. I don't feel that the flavor is substantially lost by cooking the steak for longer. Of course each temperature has its own distinct flavor, but I do not feel that a properly prepared well-done steak sacrifices much, if any, flavor. The same goes for texture, if prepared properly. That said, in general, I prefer my food cooked all the way through. When I cut into a rare steak and am greeted with a bright-red gush of raw beef and blood-like juice, I completely lose my appetite. Presentation is important when eating such an expensive meal. Finally, a fully cooked steak reduces the probability of picking up a foodborne illness. So it's a win anyway you cut it (pardon the pun).\n\n* **Why there shouldn't be a stigma around ordering well-done steak**: First of all, I'm the customer, and it's my money. I have heard that *some* restaurants (not all, obviously) might give you a [worse cut of meat](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/13ktn5/til_if_you_order_your_steak_welldone_in_a/) if you ask for it cooked well-done. This is unreasonable and contrary to the spirit of a client-focused food service industry, where the customer orders (and pays for) a meal and the restaurant delivers. If restaurants or chefs are unwilling to start with the same quality ingredients for all orders regardless of specific customer requests, then they should expressly forbid such orders on the menu, so that customers with particular preferences can choose to dine elsewhere. I used to work in a restaurant (not a steakhouse, though), and am never adversarial towards a server, so I should expect the same when I am a customer.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Racathor\n\nResponse A: There are a number of reasons that steaks cooked less are considered better. Now, I will yield, lower quality steak matters less. Lower quality cuts matter less.\n\nAs a general rule, steaks \"should\" be cooked anywhere from rare to medium, certainly showing some pink or red. The main reason, you'll find, is indeed the taste. It's almost certainly a personal thing for you, but the fact does remain, the more you cook a steak, the more flavor it will lose. A blue steak has the most flavor you will eat, and is also equally the toughest. The more you cook the meat, the more flavor you are sacrificing. At upscale places, you are paying a lot for a good cut of meat, and it is considered a waste of money to more or less cook away the taste of the meat.\n\nIn my personal experience, another reason for it is often the complimentary wines that steaks go well with. At a high-end steak house, every steak will be recommended with some wines, and recommended to be cooked a certain way, so the whole meal works. Most people who enjoy steak prefer it cooked medium or less, and so you can throw off an entire dish by cooking it differently.\n\nNow, I completely agree on the count, no restaurant should refuse you, or give you lower quality steak for this. However, you will find a deal of social stigma around ordering the steak like this, and I believe that to be somewhat warranted (though only in a mock-serious manner). Again, this is primarily because you could be paying a good amount of money, for a less flavorful steak.\n\nResponse B Author: SuB2007\n\nResponse B: The first part of your post is hard to argue with. You like what you like...most people would not agree with you, but that shouldn't change what you enjoy. However, a fully cooked steak does not decrease the possibility of picking up a foodborne illness. The potentially infectious bacteria would be found on the surface of the steak, which is being cooked, and not on the inside. \n\nI think part of the \"stigma\" surrounding people who go out and order steaks well done is that they are paying a premium for an exceptionally good cut of meat, and then having it cooked so that this exceptionally good cut is indistinguishable from an ordinary cut from the grocery store. The better the quality of a steak, the more tender and flavorful it is. The more you cook a steak, the tougher it gets, and the more flavor is lost as the juices are cooked away. So...the reason servers may laugh when someone orders a steak well done is that the person is essentially wasting money at a steakhouse because they receive none of the benefits of the premium product they're purchasing. Seems kind of silly, doesn't it?\n\nAlso, while agree that presentation is part of enjoying a meal at a restaurant, I would argue that once you have begun eating the presentation no longer matters. Whether you've got a rare steak \"bleeding\" on the plate, or mashed potatoes smeared all over and no longer in an neat pipetted floret, once you dig in the presentation is ruined anyways.\n\n\nI used to work at a steakhouse and never witnessed to be true, however, I could understand why this might happen. A \"worse cut\" might have more exterior fat, less internal marbling, be a less-ideal shaped cut (long and thin instead of short and fat), or might be a tougher end cut with more connective tissue. These would make the steak less appetizing when cooked rare-medium, but over medium most of the fat is going to cook out of the meat, a thinner cut will cook through more quickly with less drying to the meat, and cooking to temperatures over medium will cause proteins and connective tissue to knit together more tightly, toughening the meat anyways. Ultimately, your experience is not affected at all. \nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Racathor's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I'm against the criminalization of all drugs (but that's a topic for another day). I mean by the way society views it, the way that people look down and consistently discourage things like narcotics, methamphetamines, etc.\n\nI'm 19 now, and since the drinking age in my country is 18, I've seen many of my friends over the last couple of years grow into the \"alcohol\" culture that basically the entire world shares. Sometimes this has scared me. Friends that have been with me since I was 12 years old have given me times where I am legitimately scared for my safety because of alcohol, all the while the rest of the group and cheering this person on. I dislike the mere fact that getting drunk for enjoyment is socially accepted and even encouraged.\n\nI don't drink, as you've probably guessed. In fact, I stay as far away from the stuff as I can because I detest the taste, just like I stay as far away from peas as I can...but also because the mere idea of getting drunk scares me. Loosing rational control of myself is not something I would like to experience, especially if it means I could hurt someone.\n\nThe fact that I don't drink has been a point of contention for my friends, family and even just strangers I meet. Everyone seems surprised that I don't, and in almost all cases try to get to me to drink, in one case even trying to 'spike' a drink of mine with alcohol just to see me drunk. How is this acceptable behaviour in any circumstance? And yet it is, when it comes to alcohol, because it's seen as \"fixing\" me or making me less of \"a drag from not drinking.\" I've had to opt out of family events because of this.\n\nWhile it may be a specific case in my family, the idea that it's acceptable to do that is the culture around alcohol I just don't understand and almost hate. The fact that society views alcohol as a requirement for \"a good time\" is something I think is incredibly toxic to our lives. I'd say a good hefty percentage of things like car accidents, crimes like domestic abuse, fighting, etc. stems from alcohol. While I'm all for the \"everything in moderation,\" I think alcohol is something that most people can't keep moderated. \n\nWe glorify alcohol, we glorify getting drunk, society works hard to associate it with a good time to the point where most people believe that you can't have a good fun time with your friends without \"getting smashed.\" People look forward to forgetting their weekend! How crazy is that?!\n\nNo other drug is glorified this way, not even Marijuana (admittedly getting closer to it these days) which is the probably least \"harmful\" criminalized drug. I don't see why society views just alcohol this way and continues to be adamant for the criminalization on other drugs, even ones with a similar (or less) risk level like Marijuana.\n\nOther things have come into our society that operate the same as alcohol culturally, like smoking. At one point, it was all the rage. You were outcast if you didn't smoke, just like now if you don't drink. And then people realised that it was harming us, harming people with second hand smoke. And it's been slowly phased back out. It still exists, but at least in my country, it's something you never talk about, it's something that's looked down upon by most people. People are surprised and sometimes revolted if you mention you smoke, and in \"common society\" it's not something you do to \"hang out\" like drinking. And yet, I consider alcohol more harmful because with the amount of alcohol fuelled crimes and accidents, I believe it's probably done a lot more damage to individuals and indirect people than smoking ever has. \n\n**TL;DR:** I think that society should be working to discourage alcohol just like we do with other drugs. It's harmful to the people who drink it, to the people around it, and the glorification it gets in society only serves to promote something I consider inherently bad to people, even ones who wouldn't normally drink. We've already done this with something like smoking, which has similar self and indirectly other harming properties that was widely glorified. **Please CMV**. I want to understand why people think alcohol is considered acceptable to be in our culture in this way. But please don't try to convince me to drink \"just to try it so I'll see.\" \n\n\n\nI don't think my original argument is necessarily wrong itself, and I think they're good points against drinking in general and for the greater education on responsible drinking, but my post is clearly heavily stepped in selection bias.\n\nMany people have raised the point that alcohol has many benefits too, health wise, but particularly as a social lubricant that encourages much of the social interaction that we humans so desperately crave. In the long run, having alcohol as the one common thing between a lot of people is a great benefit to society, we always have a basis to return to.\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Mavericgamer\n\nResponse A: Unlike other drugs, alcohol is ingrained into our very culture on a pretty deep level. Wine has been a thing since times BC. Religious rituals use wine, we pair our foods with wines and beers. For a long time it was the best way to make sure you weren't drinking harmful bacteria, as it wouldn't grow in alcohol. Even tobacco, the second most ingrained thing in Western culture, only goes back about 2-300 years.\n\nBut I disagree that you are an outcast if you don't drink; I understand that it feels like this now. These are long-term friends who you've known for a good portion of your life. But at that age, a lot of people develop contradictory interests. I had a few friends then who I had known since I was 9 or 10. We don't talk anymore, and I'm 27. And it hurt at the time. But time heals. And I realized that I didn't want to be the friend of this person, I wanted to be the friend of someone who didn't exist, to be friends with a phantom. As of today, I am the only person in my closest group of friends who drinks even fairly often. Of the 6 other people, 4 don't drink at all, and 1 drinks very rarely, closer to being completely sober. To be fair, 2 of those are under the drinking age, but still.\n\nAlso, I don't want to sound like I'm trying to convince you, but when I was 18, I hated the taste of alcohol. Beer was disgusting and hard liquor was awful. Then I found particularly fruity cocktails. Then, as I aged, I found those too sweet. A few months after I stopped with cocktails, I was at a business function where people were drinking beer, and the CEO handed me a beer. I figured that you don't not drink a beer your CEO hands you, so I drank it, and found that it wasn't as repulsive as I once found it.\n\nI also understand the revulsion towards heavy drinking culture. I had it too, and (oh god I can't believe I'm saying this) when I was your age, I swore I'd never drink. And then I started career building, and I realized that after a certain point (and I can't point to the exact moment), you aren't seeing a bunch of people who just hit the drinking age going hard-bodied, you end up finding people who drink occasionally and socially, and not to excess. Today, I don't drink often, but every month or so, I will go out with some co-workers for happy hour and have a few beers, or a couple margaritas, or whatever.\n\nResponse B Author: TedTheViking\n\nResponse B:   \nIf you have a few drinks, you're not going to lose your mind. It takes a lot of alcohol to make a reasonable person completely lose control, and by that point they usually just pass out. The people who do stupid shit while drunk are the same people who do stupid shit while sober. People are usually just trying to live up to the expectation of \"drink and do dumb things\" and show off for their friends. I've seen girls at a party acting drunk and trying to outdo each other, completely unaware that they were drinking non-alcoholic beer the whole time.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Mavericgamer's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: Last year's Oscar winner in cinematography was *Life of Pi*.  This year's favorite darling is *Gravity*.  These films **do** have stunning cinematography; I am not questioning that.  However, the cinematography has become so completely digitized that comparing a *Life of Pi* to something like *Skyfall* is doing a great disservice to \"classic\" cinematography.  The two types should be divorced from one another and have separate categories for which to judge them.\n\nNamely: when you digitize your cinematography, you nearly have an infinite number of possibilities.  The only limit is your imagination and the budget on your effects department.  Yet when you talk about classic (\"analog\"?) cinematography, you have a lot more constraints.  You need to operate in real world, dealing with variables encountered in a real world.  A cinematographer needs to account for these variables in a way that requires a different vision than digital cinematography does.  Similarly, we don't lump animated films into the best picture category because the challenges associated with them are distinctly different than the challenges associated with \"regular\" films.  This isn't to disparage the digitization, mind you, just simply a recognition of the different skill set required to pull it off.  \n\nI envision two main counterarguments forthcoming, so I'll address them here:\n\n* The realm of digital cinematography is not expansive enough presently.  If it were to become its own category, there might only be one, maybe two, nominees.  This could be true, but it only makes the concern delayed rather than eradicated.  The future will likely see more and more digital works which could sustain a healthy pool of contenders vying for the title.\n\n* Digitization is an evolution of cinematography, not a revolution, and the creeping influence of it is witnessed even in the so-called \"classic\" cases (for instance, I referenced *Skyfall* earlier which surely isn't **entirely** classical in the sense *Shawshank* is).  Essentially: the line between \"digital\" and \"classic\" is hard to distinguish.  I actually don't think this matters that much.  All of these sorts of awards are subjective enough that you don't need an objective way of determining whether a film fits into the \"digital\" or \"classic\" cinematography bubble because the way of choosing the winner therein is not objective, yet there can likely be a general consensus found on whether a certain film would be considered for \"digital\" or \"classic\" cinematography.\n\nResponse A Author: KingStarBucks\n\nResponse A: I did a few AC/DIT gigs on commercials and generally PA'ed around.

(DISCLAIMER) And I'm actually with you on wanting to separate the two as I was absolutely pissed when Life of Pi won.\n\n\n- First: About five years back, I argued that digital camera based movies should have different awards for film camera based movies. Simply because the skill required to do film (I mistakenly believed) was significantly harder. \n\n\nWhat I did realize that as time progressed and digital cameras like the Red and Epic came out, 4K made the lines between film quality and digital blur. Then again, when I was on set, the skill to bring out the best of digital required a different eye for lighting, camera movement, and general higher standards of quality (since dailies were easily viewable). It was then that I accepted, \"Yes, all cameras are equally difficult in cinematography.\"\n\n\n- Second: Your argument that \"classic\" (pure camera) should be separate from \"digital\" (digitally enhanced or CGI).  Aside from the fact that every frame that gets shot is either recolored, digitally modified to perform a certain way, or even CGI'ed a little, the classic style and digital style also require different skill sets. From a classic standpoint, you have to note the depth of field, lighting, and the million other little factors to get that shot. Yes, these factors make the magic in cinematography, but at the highest ends of cinematography (where they get nominated), there is less concern about these factors than simply image composition. They no longer worry about the factors that could hurt the image but only what can make that image beautiful. If the image is so stunning that it leaves you in awe, the cinematographer did the job right.\n\n\nLet me go back to my hatred for Life of Pi. Yes. I was pissed that it won, but then again, would I have been pissed if, let's say, Avengers got some award for camera work? Probably not. I thought it looks amazing and enjoyed every minute of it. That is until you realize that every shot was CGI. The buildings, the ships, the explosions, everything. The entire city is a CGI remodeling of New York. Then I looked back at Life of Pi. Yes, the colors were stunning and some scenes looked amazing- but still Life of Pi shouldn't have gotten the award for cinematography... and let me explain why.\n\n\nFor everything that Life of Pi did, it did to deserve that role. The camera angles and compositions were stunning enough to make, what is essentially a story about a kid and a tiger on a boat for two hours, entertaining. The fusion of storytelling, music, AND cinematography made it. There was something that was amiss that I realized why Life of Pi should not have gotten the award. Like I said before, everything in cinematography requires a certain skill or trait to make a scene beautiful. What makes Life of Pi a different skill than let's say Skyfall is where the cinematographer should be involved. Movies like Life of Pi should require the cinematographer to become an active part in the CGI/editing process rather than just a \"ok, I'm done\" mentality. Why? Because if the CGI doesn't pop, then the scene dies and if the scene dies, the cinematographer didn't do his job. \n\n\nThis gets me to my last point. The CGI was awful for large portions of the movie. Not just like, passable bad, but like the 1st Hobbit movie dragon + coin bad. Hell, even Finding Nemo's fish were more realistic than Life of Pi at some points. This is why I personally don't think Life of Pi deserves the cinematography role, but at the end of the day, it really is cinematography. Whether it is digital or classic, the cinematographer takes an active role in create an image out of nothing (one could argue even more so for digital). If you don't think digital cinematographers have it as hard, try imagining Skyfall where everything is CGI. It would be near impossible to replicate that movie. That movie was meant for classic style and any CGI would have ruined the world. Then imagine Life of Pi without any CGI. It would be the most boring movie in the world. While they have two different skill sets, they are equally breathing life into the concept of cinematography. \n\nResponse B Author: klw\n\nResponse B: This argument comes up with every significant advancement in the technology surrounding the making of art, as if people somehow believe that the tools create the work, not the artist/cinematographer/painter/etc.\n\nPhotographers were reviled by painters, digital photographers reviled by film photographers, photoshoppers reviled by \"pure digital photographers,\" and so on and so forth.\n\nA cinematographer's job is to make a beautiful image. The tools and technology available to him/her have changed significantly since the foundation of the art, but the end goal has remained static: create visuals that artfully portray the theme and action of the screenplay being filmed. A great \"digital\" cinematographer has the same eye as a great \"classic\" cinematographer, and they're using the same basic tools to do the job--lighting, camera movement, focus, framing/composition, etc. What difference does it make if they're composing the image inside of a 3D toolset or the \"real\" world? The cinematographer must still have a good handle on the art; 3D camera tracking won't transform an average cinematographer into a genius.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author KingStarBucks's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Although some of these offers sound promising (either because of the company name or because of the compensation), i feel very reluctant to discuss them because i believe i won't like it living / working in the US.\n\n**Background**:\nOur family of 3 (wife, 6-year old kid and me) live and work in Sweden. Although not a paradise (for a number of reasons), it feels like a very decent country to live in. Below i will list some of the things i like about Sweden and what i \"believe\" i know about the US. My assumption, that i don't want to move, is based on the things i \"believe\" i know about the US.\n\n**Compensation**:\nSalaries seem much better in the US (both on paper and assuming that taxation is higher in Sweden). However, some huge differences seem to exist between different areas in the US (based on salaries listed on salary.com).\n\nVacation days seem also to be quite different. In Sweden the norm seems to be 25-30 vacation days per year, while in the US is 15-21 (?). Plus, vacation and sick days are totally different pools. When you get sick you are not paid for the first day, but you receive full pay up to day 14 of sickness. Not sure how this works in the US.\n\nLastly, we have what we call the VAB. This basically means that i can stay at home to take care of my sick kid and be paid 80% of my salary (for that day). Anything equivalent in the US?\n\n**Education**:\nAlthough i believe that graduate and post-graduate education in the US is much better than in Sweden, the fact that i will have to pay a huge amount of money for tuition (university) scares me. In Sweden, all grades of education are free.\n\n**Healthcare**:\nSweden has a state supported health system, which means that worst case scenario i will pay in a year approx $120 for doctor visits (medication not included). Even operations and \"longer\" treatment is covered by this amount. This is definitely not the picture i have from the US, where a sickness can destroy you financially.\n\n**Society**:\nThe Swedish society seems \"calmer\" that what i believe happens in the US. There are of course cases of racism and public disobedience, but not to the extend of Fergusson or some other similar events. Basically, if you live in Sweden, it feels like moving to a \"war zone\" if you move to the US.\n\nAt times, it also feels that the US is returning to the dark ages: Heavy religion influences, tele-evangelists, the Indiana law, \"wars\" outside abortion clinics, fights about gay rights, black/white racism, etc. A huge difference from what i am used to in Sweden\n\n**Epilogue**: So this is my (probably) narrow-minded view of the US, as i perceive it by reading news online (and watching the Last Week Tonight show). So, please CMV that moving to the US is a much better \"thing\" than what i have currently in my mind.\n\n\n\n* Negotiate, negotiate, negotiate\n* Don't expect anything from the government\n* Make sure your health insurance is covered\n* Prefer urban over rural areas (to get a more liberal culture)\n* Save up money for the kid's university education\n* US is not a warzone, it's as safe as Sweden\n* Media overblows everything (and focuses on the negative)\n\nThanks to all who contributed, i learnt a lot, and now i know at least how to continue my research!\n\nResponse A Author: skatastic57\n\nResponse A: Here's the thing, you're comparing the situation difference between the average Swede and the average American when you're not average.  \n\nThe average US compensation is higher than the average Swedish compensation but, for you the difference might be even higher this just comes down to what these companies are willing to offer. \nBased on a quick google search of IT salary in US and Sweden I'm coming up with $78k/yr in US and $62k/yr in Sweden.  I'm coming up with after tax income of $43k in Sweden and $68k in US.\n\nEducation, it comes down to you doing the numbers for yourself.  Your kid is 6 right now, assume that you work for the next 12 years at the higher US after tax pay, does that number pay for college?  Well it should, according to the [SUNY](https://www.suny.edu/smarttrack/tuition-and-fees/) website it'll cost about $22k/yr for college.  I picked SUNY because I'm assuming New York is a contender for prospective employers.  So can you save $88k over the next 12 years making $24k more per year.  It would seem so.  \n\nSame exercise for healthcare except this will also be a negotiation with your prospective employer.  Generally, the more prestigious the position, the better the insurance coverage will be and if they're courting you from Sweden to come to the US chances this will be a good package.  \n\nSick time, and vacation time. The US doesn't regulate either of these like Sweden apparently does.  That means these are things you'll have to negotiate up front with your employer.  Some companies treat any day you're not at work as a day off and you have one pool of days you can be away from work.  Some companies have two pools, one for sick time and one for vacation time.  Sick time applies to family members for most companies so it's very unlikely there'd be a 3rd pool for when family members are sick and there's little chance you wouldn't collect a full days pay when you used sick time for either yourself or family.  Chances are if you're highly sought over you could negotiate for 4 weeks of vacation but anything over that is not often heard of but that doesn't mean you shouldn't ask for it.\n\nSociety:  I had a coworker whose wife was from Japan and she had the same misconception about the war-zone aspect of the US.  Here's the thing, we have 322m people spread out over almost 10m sq km.  So we have over 30x the people Sweden does and 20x the land mass so when the media leads you to believe that all these things are happening right next to each other, they're painting a bad picture.  The bigger thing for you will more likely be the small things.  From my understanding Swedes don't talk to strangers almost under any circumstance where in the US a good number of people will think it rude not to say hi as you pass someone in a hallway or sidewalk etc.  (This doesn't apply to busy crowded hallways and sidewalks and isn't very strict by any means)  \n\nReally, this probably all comes down to whether you and your family *want* to live in the US.  Life is too short to come to the US because you make extra money and can get more stuff.  Why not visit one of the cities that has a company that wants to hire you.  Maybe you can get them to pay your airfare and hotel while you're here even.  See if you like it and then decide but don't decide for or against until you visit.\n\nResponse B Author: SanityInAnarchy\n\nResponse B: You make a lot of good points, but I'm not at all convinced by this:\n\n\nAccording to a quick Google search: The population of the US is 318.9 million. The population of Sweden is 9.593 million. Doing the math: The US has over 33 times more people than Sweden.\n\nEven if the two places were identical in all other respects, you can expect 33 times more of *everything,* including the really bad stuff. And the news prioritizes the really bad stuff.\n\nThe US is also really, really big. Again, going from lazy Google searches: Sweden is some 173,000 square miles, or about 450,000 square kilometers. The US is some 3.8 *million* square miles, or 9.8 *million* square kilometers. It's also mostly empty -- our population is massively concentrated on the coasts.\n\nIf you're in IT, the obvious likely place you'd end up is Silicon Valley, which is about a two *thousand* mile drive from Ferguson. That's a longer drive than it is from Stockholm (Sweden) to Madrid (Spain). You're considerably closer to Kiev (Ukrane), which literally *is* a war zone.\n\nWhether you actually want to be in the Bay Area is another question, but that's not the point. You can live in New York City, which, to be fair, is only some 968 miles from Ferguson. Point is, the US is big, and if you really have companies begging you to come here, you can probably afford to pick a part of it that's not at all like Ferguson.\n\nA quick run-down of your other points:\n\n\nYep, largely because cost of living can be vastly different. I mentioned the Bay Area -- look at the rent here, and compare it to the rent in, say, Iowa or Texas.\n\n\nThis is why, in the US, people generally have health insurance. If you took a reasonably well-paid IT job, you could expect your employer to *also* pay for your health insurance, and probably that of your immediate family. This is a profoundly *weird* system, but it means that if you're well-paid, it's probably not worse for you here than it is in a country with socialized medicine.\n\nOf course, it's *much* worse if you're poor.\n\n\nIt varies *massively* from company to company. If you ever decide to come here, you need to research this thoroughly. Some companies give almost no time off, Netflix gives as much as you want. Most are somewhere in between.\n\nThat said, here, two weeks is about the norm. More than that is considered generous. This is one thing that makes me envious of Europe in general.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author skatastic57's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Now I want to be a doctor and am slowly thinking that socialized medicine is the way to go, but all I can think about is the high(15%) taxes and ridiculous wait times. Why aunt who lives there has to book a mammogram at least 3 months in advance. I'm a teenager so when I was younger was only 6 years ago so I doubt very much has changed.

So please CMV\n\nResponse A Author: Quetzalcoatls\n\nResponse A: In a socialized medicine system the biggest tradeoff you make is that you will wait longer for treatment but that you will have access to it and it will be either highly affordable or free. This is in contrast to a free market system where you get treatment faster but thats conditioned on one having enough money to pay. If you don't have enough money or do not have insurance in a free market system the only treatment you receive is shit that can be treated in the emergency room. As someone who is aspiring to be a doctor I'm sure you can understand why waiting that long for treatment is not a good thing. \n\nYour aunt has to book a mammogram 3 months in advance which sucks but at the same time shes 100% going to get that mammogram. It isn't dependent on her being employed, getting health insurance, having a lot of money. All that matters in her case is that she needs some preventative care. In a free market system what determines if you get care is money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: I live in a country with socialised medicine and infact I've been in hospital several times over the last few months for surgery and follow up treatment.\n\nIt works no better or worse than private healthcare and the only real difference that I could see was the lack of a private room and the waiting times.\n\nDoctors and nurses are humans and I'm by no means convinced that the standard of medical care that I would have received from the doctors or the skills of the surgeon would have been any better in a private hospital and in fact, in many cases it's the same doctors who work for the state health system that also do private work!\n\nWhat - specifically - do you feel is better under a privatised system?\n\nPersonally I'm willing (and able) to go private for the fact that I would have a room to myself and no waiting list for elective surgery, but I'm also happy to pay my taxes to help those that aren't as fortunate as myself.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Quetzalcoatls's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp:   I am of the right age to remember the Tony Martin case, which caused something of a debate about the use of potentially lethal force in defence of property or of yourself. \n\n  However I cannot see any problem in the use of lethal force if a homeowner is dealing with burglars. There is no option in most situations, and especially not in the pitch black night when most burglaries occur, to analyse the situation and decide on a course of action, and it is increasingly common to find that said burglars are often armed, and fully prepared to use their weapons. People have been tortured and even killed in their own homes by invaders. So it can only be reasonable that homeowners have some means of protection. \n\n  So, CMV. \n\nResponse A Author: cerberaspeedtwelve\n\nResponse A: I think this is one of the small but crucial differences between American and British psychology. In the UK, the prevailing opinion (amongst the government, at least) is that nobody's property, no matter how valuable, is worth taking a life over. Even if you broke into five hundred houses (and some burglars have) you are still considered redeemable. Human life is the ultimate sacred ideal - unbreakable, immutable, untradeable for any other commodity.\n\nIn the US, human life is not seen as something you can never lawfully take away. That's why lots of states have the death penalty, citizens can own guns and reasonably use them to defend themselves, and a dozen other exceptions.\n\nI think my overall point is that using lethal force against an intruder is never going to be palatable in the UK until a major shift in the zeitgeist.\n\nResponse B Author: RashaGirl\n\nResponse B: I think that in some situations, using lethal force in burglars is a logical and correct option, particularly if they are threatening the lives of the homeowners. However, I do not think that it should be a get out of jail free card. I do not think that people should have full rights to shoot *any* intruder in the home because it will give certain people the sense of security in shooting first. People will assume, correctly or incorrectly, that this law would give them consequence-free shooting rights in their homes. There are people out there who would just love to kill others. There are people who believe that stealing a piece of gum should warrant the death penalty. These people are the problem. With such a law enacted, even if they know that the intruder is only there to steal a TV or that the intruder is an unarmed 14 year old girl, they will be more than happy to shoot them because they do not care about human life (heck, they are just blood thirsty) and because they have this free reign law backing them up. I think that a much better law would be one where a person can shoot if their life is threatened (with some leeway of course in regards to realistically perceived threats).

If you don't do this, you put both your car and the cars next to you at risk for scratches/dings.  It takes significantly longer than just pulling into the spot, front first.

On the other hand, having hookups/FWB is so simple. We have sexual intimacy, we can hang out and we can talk. It's pretty much all the best parts of a LTR without the hassle of being committed/having to care. Why should I settle down when I can use my youth to my full advantage? Are there any benefits for me to actually try to get to know a person and possibly have a relationship with them? \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: SerFunkyBrewster\n\nResponse A: I'm not sure a six month relationship is a good gauge for long-term relationships.  I've had a handful of these, and when I look back at them and compare it to my current relationship (five years), I realize I was effectively \"playing house\" because this is how I saw people relate in TV and movies and this is just what adults do and how they act.  Seeing as I was a youngish adult at the time, this was just the template I used and I don't think it's unusual on my part to assume what we observe in pop culture is the norm.  I was using a bolstered first-date personality, behavior and lifestyle (putting my best foot forward, so-to-speak) as a foundation for a relationship and that is, frankly, exhausting.  It was more like unintentional theater.\n\nHad I been more upfront towards the beginning of our commitment, I could have focused more on building a foundation of mutual trust and communication, thus alleviating the burden I put on myself and my SO to make things work.  It's a shaky ground to stand on and always fell through at about the six month mark.  It hurt like all break-ups do, but I'd like to think I learned from them.\n\nNow, I have a partner.  A *partner.*  My SO is reliable and always there for me.  Being present makes me happy.  We have shared interests and can do things together but with the additional bonus of being intimate in a way I never imagined.\n\nIt was incredibly scary around the 1 year mark because I really started letting this person know details and fears that I hadn't shared before and that requires an awful lot of trust and respect, but now I'm immensely grateful that I've found someone who is in my corner and acutely aware of my perspective.\n\nThe sex is fantastic.  Sex can be good in non-committal relationships but we've had the benefit of being able to discuss what feels good, understand each other's respective turn-ons, and have had multiple bouts of differently toned sex ranging from playful to aggressive to slow and romantic.  There are times we have sex and I feel as though it's more conversational in that I am relaying how my feelings in a way I could not with words.\n\nIt is possible that this isn't what you're looking for at this point in your life.  Sometimes when you're young, you move around or have different jobs or your schedule is wonky.  It's understandable if that's not conducive to a stable relationship.  However, I wouldn't write off long-term relationships simply because you're good-looking.  Being able to devote yourself to one person and accept the devotion of another (harder than it sounds) is something a lot of people end up wanting down the line, and you don't want to assume that there is \"waste\" in pursuing that kind of relationship, or find yourself flailing to learn how to cultivate that sort of dynamic as you get older.\n\nResponse B Author: incruente\n\nResponse B: \"all the best parts of a LTR\". I think you may be overlooking a lot of benefits of a LTR. There's a lot more than sex and companionship, at least companionship on that kind of level. My wife and I are joined on a much deeper level than some weekend shackup; we hold the interests of the other as our own. I do not consider my destiny to be independent of hers; if she fails, we fail. I would die to protect her, and I know she feels the same about me. We have a level of dedication that I would be hard pressed to find in the \"casual encounters\" craigslist ads.\n\n\" Why should I settle down when I can use my youth to my full advantage?\" You're asking the wrong question. Relationships, at least long term ones, are not about the full advantage to one person or the other; they are about not only a mutual advantage, but a mutual respect. If you're going into a relationship with the attitude \"How is this the best for me?\", then you're not ready for a LTR.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author SerFunkyBrewster's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

It stands to reason that when it comes to referencing centuries versus specific years, that the numerical system rather than the ordinal system is obviously superior; we can both designate the \"1900s\" and \"1914\", but we cannot designate an individual year with \"20th century.\"\n\nThis system also makes it more difficult for non-English speakers to understand, as they have enough on their plate figuring out our mish-mash of a language, let alone how many dates they could get wrong during translation. Hell, I sometimes get it wrong when I'm not paying enough attention, especially when it gets back into less recent history - English speakers know automatically that \"19th century\" and \"20th century\" refer to 1800s and 1900s, but how many of us automatically make the shift when we hear \"7th century\"?\n\nThe only issue I can see is that when discussing Roman-era history, around the time 100 BC-100 AD, it might make referring to the \"1st Century\", 1-100 AD a little more difficult. However, the problem persists even in BC with the confusion of the ordinal century lagging behind the actual year date. \n\nMy CMV is that this is a confusing system and bad for international students, casual readers, and even for historians and archaeologists. The below proposal is just a suggestion for discussion, and shredding it, as I'm sure this subreddit will, will **not necessarily** change my view on the whole subject.\n\nTherefore, I think that, when referencing these two centuries, it might be more instructive to refer to them in a similar manner that some refer to the most recent full decade, the \"oughts\". Given that 2000 is technically part of the 1990s, this means that 2001-2010 are referred to on occasion as the \"oughts\" when referring to decades, in lieu of the '20s, '30s, and so forth. So we should refer to the 1st century AD as \"the ought century\" AD, and then continue with 100s AD, 200s AD, and same for BC.\n\nThat was just a suggestion. On the greater subject, however, Reddit, CMV!\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: MrGraeme\n\nResponse A: I fail to see how this could be confusing after a very brief explanation or even reading the text. \n\nWhen we begin a century, we have started another one. Meaning that if the year is 1802, we have passed two days in the new(19th) century.\n\nThis is typically used to describe periods roughly- times where we don't have a start or end date, but we know the general time in which the event(s) occurred.\n\nTo say a year, such as 1803, is much more exact, and is typically used when dealing with known dates rather than estimated or uncertain ones.\n\nVery few texts refer to time periods as *the 1900s*, rather they refer to the time between specific dates- it's used when we can be more accurate with our estimations than centuries. Take, say, 1843-1924. \n\n\nResponse B Author: KingBim\n\nResponse B: * Okay, so your problem with using both terms seems to be that it is confusing. Whilst I would agree that it can be confusing at an entry level to discussing history, your statement is not specifically about texts designed for such use. If I were to write a thesis for a history degree, your statement would still apply, but I think that by the time a certain degree of complexity is reached in the writing it is quite fair to assume the reader won't be confused by the two ways of describing a century.\n\n* So what about if we are considering a text that we can reasonably expect to be read by those who may not pick up on the difference? Surely such a text could explicitly state that the two are the same at the start, and then continue without fuss?\n\n* I would argue that the benefit of being able to describe a century in two ways that arises from the variance in writing (ie not always having to write 1600s but being able to write 17th century instead) outweighs the potential confusion, especially if care is taken to imply or state that the two are the same early on in the text.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author MrGraeme's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: In my view, there is no reason why a rational, responsible person has to be a vegetarian. I am not saying that vegetarianism has no benefits, but only that these benefits do not obligate a reasonable person to become a vegetarian.\n\nThe burden of proof for the claim that we are morally obligated to be vegetarians falls on the vegetarian who thinks that we have this obligation. This is because there should be a good reason behind a moral obligation (moral obligations shouldn't be arbitrary) and because the vegetarian is suggesting a change to the way that most people currently live. Therefore, it makes sense to investigate this issue by asking what reasons vegetarians can give for saying that there is a moral obligation to be a vegetarian. \n\nI will consider the reasons given by the vegetarian philosopher William O. Stephens in his paper [\"Five Arguments for Vegetarianism.\"](http://puffin.creighton.edu/phil/stephens/fiveargumentsforvegetarianism.htm) The failure of the arguments in this paper will establish a prima facie case that respondents will need to overturn by presenting fresh reasons why vegetarianism is morally obligatory or overturning my objections to Stephens' arguments.\n\n**First Argument: The Argument from Distributive Justice**\n\nAccording to this argument, meat is produced in a way that wastes a lot of grain; for example, producing one pound of beef apparently requires 16 to 21 pounds of grain and soy. That grain would be better spent by sending it to poorer nations to feed the hungry. Therefore, we have a moral obligation to be vegetarians.\n\nFirst of all, this argument assumes that we are morally obligated to help the hungry in other countries. I agree that helping poor people can be a nice thing to do, but as an egoist and follower of Ayn Rand's ethics, I do not believe that we have a moral obligation to engage in that kind of charity. So at most, this argument establishes that it would be nice to help the poor by giving up meat, not that we have a moral obligation to help the poor by giving up meat.\n\nSecond, the problem is not so much that we're not producing enough food as that we are having trouble distributing the food. [This source](http://12.000.scripts.mit.edu/mission2014/problems/inadequate-food-distribution-systems) explains some of the problems involved in feeding the hungry: \"Enough food is produced worldwide to feed all the people in the world (Leathers, p. 133).  However, despite this alarming truth, nearly 1 billion people are suffering from chronic hunger today. There are a wide range of factors that contribute to this problem, but perhaps one of the most significant is poor food distribution.\"\n\n**Second Argument: The Argument from Environmental Harm**\n\nAccording to this argument, farming meat causes various forms of environmental harm, such as that produced by the greenhouse gases given off by the process of farming cattle.\n\nThis argument assumes that a person should act based on the well being of the environment, rather than their own self interest. It is possible that farming cattle and other practices that produce greenhouse gases will lead to global warming, but the effects of global warming will occur far enough in the future that most people alive today will not be affected.\n\nFurthermore, farming cattle is not the major source of greenhouse gas emissions. The study \"Dietary choices and greenhouse gas emissions - assessment of impact of vegetarian and organic options at national scale\" by Helmi Risku-Norja, Sirpa Kurppa and Juha Helenius ([link](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/228790125_Dietary_choices_and_greenhouse_gas_emissionsassessment_of_impact_of_vegetarian_and_organic_options_at_national_scale/file/79e4150f987f15f16f.pdf)) concluded as follows:\n\n\nextent of the necessary changes. Instead of stressing the impact of individual citizens\u2019 food choices, more attention should be paid to designing effective policy instruments and to social learning.\n\nSo everyone becoming vegetarian isn't a good solution to global warming, since it would only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7%. The major source of greenhouse gas emissions is soil, which is used by virtually all forms of farming.\n\n**Third Argument: The Feminist Argument from Sexual Politics**\n\nThis argument lists 16 examples of cases in which meat eating is associated with masculinity, then concludes that we should stop eating meat in order to undermine the patriarchy that dominates our society.\n\nI think there probably is some kind of link between meat eating and masculinity, but I'm not convinced that the patriarchy would be particularly undermined by people refusing to eat meat. I think there are probably more important reforms to worry about before we go adjusting our dietary choices to make sure they don't have subconscious patriarchal associations.\n\n**Fourth Argument: The Argument from Moral Consideration for Animals**\n\nStephens presents two examples of arguments from moral consideration for animals. The first, by Peter Singer, argues that since all sentient beings deserve equal moral consideration, and animals obviously have more at stake in not being slaughtered than humans have at stake in not being able to eat animals, we should not eat meat. The second, by Tom Regan, argues that all experiencing subjects of a life have equal inherent value, but farming animals and eating them does not treat them as having inherent value equal to ours, so we should not eat meat.\n\nI don't think either of these arguments create an obligation to be a vegetarian because I am an egoist. I acknowledge that we should not be unnecessarily cruel to animals, but this is because being cruel to animals would make us more brutal toward each other. \n\nBasically, the question is whether animals have rights, and more broadly, what the source of rights is. There is no intrinsic obligation to give equal rights to all sentient beings, on my view, but only to sentient beings who are capable of reasoning. Sentient beings who are capable of reasoning need rights because they can be deterred from producing new inventions and innovations if they see that they can be stripped of the profits from those inventions and innovations by others. So human beings need to be given rights for egoistic reasons, but animals do not.\n\n**Fifth Argument: The Prudential Argument from Health**\n\nThis argument asserts that it is a lot healthier to be a vegetarian for a variety of reasons including the fact that some cultures which primarily eat vegetables have long life expectancies and the fact that the strength and stamina of vegetarians has been shown to be greater than that of meat eaters in studies.\n\nThis is probably the best argument for vegetarianism by the standard of egoism. I will agree that vegetarianism probably has some health benefits, but I don't think that this creates an obligation to be a vegetarian because it is possible to get those health benefits while still eating some meat. Eating meat might even be better, since omega-3 fatty acids can be gotten more easily by eating fish than by eating vegetables. Also, a lot of people think meat tastes better than vegetables, which might provide some reason to eat meat even if vegetarianism is agreed to be strictly healthier.\n\nI conclude that there is no moral obligation to be a vegetarian. Thanks for reading.\n\nResponse A Author: PulaskiAtNight\n\nResponse A: \nYou don't have to experience a future event in order to be affected by it. If we can logically deduce that our children, grandchildren, etc, are negatively affected to certain extents due to our actions, and we assume an unconditional love for them regardless of their impending existence (which you might not agree with personally, but surely many people would agree with), then we thus will experience suffering, or as you may prefer, \"negative utility\".\n\nAs far as environmental effects of farming meat, cattle and greenhouse gases alone is [just one small contribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production#Energy_consumption_and_greenhouse_gas_emissions). Not to mention the consequences of meat processing and transportation, though that may not be strictly relevant.\n\nResponse B Author: chon92\n\nResponse B: \nHold on now, all being a vegetarian is is not doing something. The burden of proof actually falls on the person doing a thing to justify that thing as being morally permissible. Every time you kill an animal or buy a meat product, you contribute directly or indirectly to the suffering of animals (I personally don't believe the actual consumption of meat is morally relevant in and of itself). It's not my job to explain why you shouldn't do that, it's your job to explain why you can.\n\nThe problem is, there is no compelling moral consideration (even by the moral standards of egoism) that renders eating meat okay. It's not good for the environment, it's not good for other people, it's not good for the animals, and most importantly (apparently) it's not good for you.\n\nSo why is it morally permissible for you to continue eating meat?Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author PulaskiAtNight's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

As a result of not drinking I\u2019ve stopped going to parties, as have the number of invites stopped coming. Six months into university the drinking culture is even worse than before. Essentially every school event is closely tied to drinking. As I don\u2019t drink and people seem to be somewhat weirded out by that, I\u2019ve yet to attend one of these uni events. \n\nNot that I think adults or more *sophisticated* drinkers are any better. They come across to me as elitist and pretentious. \u201cOh, you\u2019re drinking *that*?\u201d, \u201cthis wine has hints of pear and an underlying smoky taste\u201d, to which I can only roll my eyes.\n\nI also dislike the notion of inebriety being seen as something desirable and cool. Losing the ability of rational thinking, depending on it as a social lubricant, having lesser-than-average consensual sex, breaking things, hurting people physically or emotionally all seem like idiotic things, even less so boasting about it. Not to mention the adverse health and economic implications that entail this activity.\n\nAt the same time I feel like an outcast among my peers. I cannot relate to their weekend antics at a fundamental level and I fear that I might miss out on things I\u2019ll never be able to experience later on.

Please CMV.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: PinballWizrd\n\nResponse A: \nIgnoring everything else, this quote really stood out to me.  You take pride in not drinking because you believe it takes self discipline, when from my perspective it takes none at all.  \n\nSelf discipline implies that you have the personal strength to avoid a particular temptation.  Someone on a diet choosing to eat a salad (which they hate) over fast food (which they love) is discipline.  A recovering alcoholic choosing to abstain from alcohol even though he really wants it takes discipline.  *You* choosing to abstain from alcohol does not take discipline, it doesn't require strength, because you despise alcohol, there is no temptation for you.  You look down on those who chose to drink any amount of alcohol and feel superior as a result.\n\nDon't get me wrong, choosing not to drink alcohol is not the end of the world.  You can have a very fulfilling life and have a lot of fun without it, but **you *will miss out on a lot of life experiences**, many of which may not even directly involve alcohol.\n\nYou are going to miss out on making a lot of great friends and meeting interesting people simply because they drink alcohol and you do not, just because you judge them for their personal choices and not for who they are.  You are going to miss out on events because your friends will assume you didn't want to go because there would be some drinking involved.  You are going to miss out on meeting tons of great woman who you probably wouldn't be able to start a conversation with outside of social events such as parties or at bars.  You are going to to miss out on many great nights hanging out with your friends because they were drinking and they assume you wouldn't want to come.  \n\nThat last one is a big one to me, some of my favorite memories are simply drinking with a small group of friends and talking.  People are less socially anxious with a few beers in them and you get to have deeper conversations that they normally would never talk about because they are too shy.\n\nMy advice to you is to go to a bar or to a friends house and have a drink or two, see how it feels.  Maybe you will realize that it is not the worst thing in the world and that life will go on after trying it.  Maybe you might actually enjoy the feeling of having a slight buzz.  Maybe you will at least learn to be comfortable around it and can have a drink or two so you wont miss out on many of the opportunities life has to offer.

They drink it because alcohol makes you feel good, makes music sound better, makes conversation more interesting, makes food taste amazing.\n\nAt a certain point (tipsy), alcohol starts giving you a europhic feeling.\n\nPeople that don't drink seem like boring cowards to me.\n\nIt's great that you can enjoy life without having a drink once in a while, but that's a clear signal to me that we probably won't have any fun together.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author PinballWizrd's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Bookmarks are very useful because they let me get back to where I paused very quickly, without the bother of trying to recall what page number I was on from memory. They come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes, some are colourful, they may have nice messages on them - I think book lovers are aware of the little aesthetic pleasure of bookmarks. \n\nSo why do some people not use them? I don't understand it at all. I pick up free bookmarks from the local library (they have the opening hours printed on them - yay!), and I've also used a strip of paper to use as a bookmark when I've needed to. And if I use a strip of white paper as a bookmark I sometimes use it to scribble notes about the book, though if I own the book I'm fine with scribbling in the margins as well.

Or more realistically, there is no risk of the bookmark falling out by accident stranding you.\n\nResponse B Author: Kirkaine\n\nResponse B: I generally only read in whole chapters, making it a simple matter for me to remember what page I was up to.  I highlight and take notes along the way, making it even easier.\n\nReading in whole chapters is the way to go.  You don't listen to an album and pause half way through a song, do you?  The chapter divisions are there for a reason.  Each chapter should be considered its own atomic unit, one coherent item to be considered as a whole.  Start reading in whole chapters and you'll never need a bookmark again.\n\nAs for taking notes, all your method does is leave you as a low-resolution copy of the author.  The way to get smarter is to read lots of books, and see how they link together.  Get a notebook and keep all your notes in the one place, rather than a mess of scraps of paper that will just get lost.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Hq3473's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Deflected shots are far harder to stop than straight ones, because you have practically zero time to react to them, and you're often still trying to get into position for where the puck was about to go before the deflection.   So from that standpoint, the person who deflected it contributed much more to the goal than the one who shot.  \n\nAnd it's not easy to deflect, either.  You need the same reaction time as the goalie, but without all the big pads to help you out.  You're using just a few square inches of stick blade, and angling it so precisely that the puck misses the goalie but still hits the net. \n\nResponse B Author: Ohuma\n\nResponse B: First of all, it is impossible to truly distinguish whether someone attempted to deflect the puck or not. There have been numerous instances where I've been tied up in front of the net where I've deflected the puck intentionally where someone might just see the puck banking off my shin as incidental. \n\nNot only that without the unintentional or intentional deflection, there is no way to discern whether the original shot would have gone in if it wasn't for the man **responsible** for it deflecting off them.

It is using someone's skin tone as a prop when those individuals *continue* to receive negative stereotypes for being just that. our skin is not a prop for you to exploit for your entertainment. \n\nThis is best demonstrated by the question of why is it necessary to portray a character/person to use blackface?

The wearer then has the ability to create a false narrative about that group of people. It is an act of marginalization. This is why minstrel shows were harmful in the first place, the group in power used black skin as prop for entertainment and created false narratives about black people loving friend chicken and being poor simpletons only fit for menial work.  but in reality most everyone loves fried chicken because it is delicious and black people are obviously not simpletons only fit for menial work. \n\n\nno you most certainly can dress up as MLK there is just 0 need for you to use blackface. \n\n\nResponse B Author: jay520\n\nResponse B: \nI see absolutely no reason why you need to dress up as MLK in order to celebrate his life and accomplishments. That doesn't make any sense to me. MLK is respected because of his message and his *ideas*, not because of the way he *dressed*, and certainly not because of his *skin color*. I've never once heard of anyone who thought that dressing up as an intellectual, particularly down to their skin color, was somehow necessary or beneficial to celebrating his/her accomplishments. This is a pretty poor example.\n\nFurthermore, even if it wasn't intrinsically racist, I can't think of a scenario where the benefits of Blackface would outweigh the detriments of offending a large group of people. As stated above, Blackface is not necessary to any celebratory reasons, so the only use I see for it is amusement (for Halloween or whatever). While amusement is not inherently racist, I do not believe that amusement is an excuse for offending a large group of people. So you still shouldn't do it.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author KhaleesiBubblegum's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

But IR doesn't inherit any properties from it's children or members.\n\nConsider \"Cutlery\" and one of it's specific forms \"Knifes\".

It possesses neither the particular characteristics of Capitalism, Communism or Socialism - it only possesses the commonality between these specific forms - and none of their differences.\n\n(I do however sympathise with the similarity you might be referencing. Since induction is reliant on past evidence, it can be said to be an \"appeal\" to the \"authority\" of that evidence. In a metaphorical or poetic sense, you can say this, but not in a literal sense - since \"induction\" can not \"appeal\", only humans can, and evidence can not possess the property of \"authority\", which requires the ability to know things better than other knowers, as evidence can't \"know\".)\n\nResponse B Author: Abstract_Atheist\n\nResponse B: \nAn appeal to authority is a specific form of inductive reasoning, but not all inductive reasoning consists of an appeal to authority. For example, if I note that everyone born prior to, say, 1850 was human and died, and then infer from this that all humans will eventually die, I have not appealed to any authority even though I have made an inductive inference.

I have a hard time believing they need a guy waving a stick to keep time or play an accent. Most times the musicians are looking at their sheet music or just around in general as they play. \n\nI suppose if the conductor was the writer of the piece being played, he could influence inflections or subtleties, but who needs a guy waving his hands to show forty life-long professional musicians how to play long established pieces like Mozart?\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: ulyssessword\n\nResponse A: \nWhy is the writer the only person who can put subtleties into their performance?  Having all of the musicians giving the *same* emphasis is important, and what separates performing a solo from performing as part of a group.  \n\nSoloists give emphasis, accents, and modified timing wherever they feel it is right.  Members of a large group must give up that power to one person or else the music is either a muddled mess or else just dry and sterile.\n\n\nResponse B Author: spice_weasel\n\nResponse B: Written music actually isn't terribly precise.  There are a lot of subtleties that can come in, ranging from strength or tone of attacks, how quickly you crecendo or taper off, how much you slow down, etc.  Even in a solo performance, there's quite a bit of room for interpretation.\n\nWhen you scale up to a large group of musicians, the issue is compounded many times over.  The different musicians will each have different interpretations, and they sit in different parts of the stage, which influences how they hear the music.  The conductor is the one who makes the ensemble work together to work toward a single interpretation of the piece.  \n\nAlso, professional musicians watch their director quite closely.  My most advanced musical experience was playing in a university orchestra, but we had a few world-famous guest conductors.  You did NOT make the mistake of letting them catch you not paying attention.  Even when you're looking at your music, you are tracking the conductor in your peripheral vision.  You don't have to stare at them at every second, but you watch for your cues in the tricky bits, and you watch for direction regarding volume, intonation, phrasing, etc.  A good conductor keeps the entire piece in their head, and they relay an incredible amount of information to the ensemble.\n\nAlso, why on earth would having a conductor only be useful if they are the writer?  Different conductors have different interpretations of different pieces, and to the practiced ear, there are incredible variations between different performances even of \"long established pieces\".  There isn't a single Platonically ideal \"correct\" version of the song.  That's just a part of how musical performance works.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author ulyssessword's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

(long)\n\nOp: **HELLO! IF YOU'RE READING THIS POST AND YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER, AS WELL AS THE FOURTH BOOK OF LEGEND OF KORRA, LIKE, WHY? YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE SPOILERS. IT'S YOUR FAULT. STOP OR BE SORRY.**\n\nOkay. Maybe this is shitty of me as a person. Maybe I'm just closed-minded and white cisgendered homophobic (I hope I'm not, but hey). But I seem to be one of the like three total fans of Legend of Korra that did not think the series ended the way it should have.\n\nThroughout the entire four seasons, nearly every character underwent such major development. Mako used to be a selfish asshole who only cared for his brother and pro-bending, but at the end of the series he was an independent but caring detective who actively contributed to the safety of not only Republic City citizens, but the entire Earth Kingdom. Bolin was an immature kid but at the end of the series he was a matured public speaker who fought for love and for his country. And Korra, most of all, was a childish, uncultured, self-important bender who didn't know what being the Avatar meant, but at the end of the series, up until as close as three minutes before the end, was an independent, mature woman who had learned so much about what it meant to be the Avatar on a global scale. \n\nThe finale, however, wherein she is (canonically, as of tonight) romantically matched with Asami, a seemingly minor female character, completely devalued all character development for her and wrapped up the show in the absolute worst way.\n\n*1. To pair Korra, a seemingly strong female character, with anyone at all, would not do her justice.* Avatar Korra is a strong, independent Water Tribe woman who don't need no man (or, uh, girl). She broke up with Mako in the second season because she couldn't be with him and be Avatar at the same time, which is a theme consistent with The Last Airbender; Aang had to let go his earthly tethers to enter the Avatar State. The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara, so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most (being very generous) half of a season of very vague and ambiguous \"um hey I like u\" for Korra. Even if Korra and Mako or Bolin had gotten together at the end, I don't think I'd have been as happy as if Korra went on being the Avatar as the strong woman she was made out to be.\n\n*2. To pair Korra with a relatively minor character who was only significant when it was convenient to the team, regardless of gender, is objectively bad fiction.* I don't hate Asami as a character, and I don't hate them being paired because they're both girls and ew yuck same sex. I hate the situation because Asami Sato didn't exist for half of the first season. When she started existing, it was to foil Korra, which was fine and actually good conflict at the time. Then, when it's discovered her dad Hiroshi Sato was an Equalist and a villain, she joined Team Avatar \"full-time\". She and Mako and Korra have had romantic conflict since season two, but Asami was barely important in season three and slightly more important in season four. I say slightly important and not completely unimportant because she was relevant whenever Team Avatar needed a hiding spot/base of operations, a plot weapon, or transportation. But seriously, Varrick ended up being more important to the plot that Asami, and he wasn't even really Team Avatar for three entire seasons.\n\n*3. There is no way this ending wasn't fanservice.* This show is the sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, a mature show that the fans called for a sequel to. The first season ended in a murder-suicide. The second season finale completely changed the world of Avatar forever. The third season ended on a terrifying cliffhanger. The fourth (and final) season finale? Avatar Korra, the most powerful bender on the planet, and Asami Sato, one of the two most intelligent minds on the planet (the other being on honeymoon), *go on vacation in the Spirit World and get romantically involved*. While Republic City, Zaofu, and the Earth Kingdom en masse are in ruins, Mako's (and somewhat Bolin's) plots are left almost completely unresolved, The new Earth King is considering radically changing the structure of the Earth Kingdom, the New Air Nation is left nearly forgotten, and literally *every possible way to end the series logically* was unresolved. What!?This relationship is cop-outy bad writing if it were with anybody, literally anyone on the cast, but being it's the only other female character of any importance makes it that much worse. And it's so out of left field! It feels like a fucking fan fiction! It's almost like the directors didn't even care to build to the reveal. \"Oh and they're lesbians, surprise. THE END.\"\n\nWhy wouldn't they just end the series with a Tenzin-Korra mentor-student moment, or a Korra-Father moment, or even a tiny reference to Aang and the Gaang, or anything other than the new, forced relationship between Korra and Asami? Why end the series with a relationship at all?! Not to mention how awkward and \"ambiguous\" they had to make it to make it PC enough for Nickelodeon.\n\nugh...\n\n**Please, change my view and make me see how this awkward and seemingly rushed homosexual relationship between Korra and a \"main\" character is the best possible resolution for the show.** I want to love this show again. I've been with Avatar since I was in eight grade and loved all of it until the finale of the last season.\n\nNot to mention, the fandom *fucking exploded* with a ton of \"OMG DAE FORSHADOWING FOR EVERY SEASON LOOK THEY OBVIOUSLY LOVE EACH OTHER\" posts. I cannot fucking *stand* people devaluing the show entirely as Korra's \"coming out story\" because she was \"fighting her sexuality\" throughout the final season. That shit happened with Frozen and I wouldn't hear it, so it infuriates me that this point of view has a foothold thanks to the writers. \n\nI refuse to believe that the writers of such amazing fiction in the past would resort to \"okay now we want you to hate the show so we don't have to do more\". I want to see the light, dammit.\n\nAnd to clarify, I don't care that they're les or bi or what the fuck ever. I hate that my opinion is automatically devalued as \"HOMOFOB NOOOOO\" by the vast majority of the ATLA and ALOK subreddits, not to even mention Tumblr.\n\nSorry this is long.\n\n\nResponse A Author: BenIncognito\n\nResponse A: \nAang had to let go his earthly connections to open the seventh chakra. But this doesn't mean all Avatars must never have romantic connections, the waterbender Avatar before Korra had a love interests, and Roku had a wife!\n\nAnd to further expand on the whole Aang thing, he very clearly *didn't* let Katara go. They kissed at the end of the season and if you pay attention real close in LoK you can even spot their offspring. Aang's conversation with Avatar Yangchen on the Lion Turtle pretty much summed it up: the Avatar's job is *balance* and because of that they cannot completly sever their Earthly connection. I think Guru Patik was wrong about this aspect of the Avatar and was trying to bring Aang back to his Airbender roots. \n\nAll that said, pairing Korra with someone romantically doesn't make her not a strong and independant woman. Both her and Asami are independant women who fell in love. Their relationship is clearly not codependent or anything like that. Korra didn't write for two whole years!\n\n\nDid you even watch Book 3? Korra and Asami spent something like 85% of that season together. Asami was a pretty important character even back in book 1! And while she was pushed to the sideline in book 2 she came back with a bang and is just as part of the krew as Bolin.\n\nBut really, why is pairing up a main character with a minor one (not that Asami was, mind) bad fiction? Should main character romantic interests only involve other main characters or something?\n\n\nAs Bryan put it...which fans? Plenty were in your camp and didn't want to see Korrasami become cannon, plenty more wanted to see Makorra happen and I think we all wanted to see Bolin hook up with Wing. You can't please all of the fans all of the time and I think it's clear that they went with the paring that made sense for the characters.\n\n\nIf you think that relationship was rushed y'all need to rewatch the 3rd and 4th books. Korra and Asami go from friends to best friends to clearly something more by the end. It's slow and building the entire time.\n\nNow I want to address your thesis - that the Legend of Korra devalued Korra's development as a character. Korra was a very headstrong Avatar and thought that the best way out of any situation was to punch it to death. And how does she defeat all of her enemies? Amon - punches. Unnavaatu - spirit punches. Zaheer - Avatar State punches. Kuvira - saving her life, and talking about their common traits.\n\nKuvira was just about as strong a bender as a non-Avatar can get. She was able to hold her own against Korra and even got the upper hand when she fired the cannon. It was clear that this wasnt a problem Korra was going to be able to punch herself out of. By saving Kuvira's life and by talking to her in the spirit world Korra was able to single-handedly dismantle the Earth Empire. Do you think those dudes in the mechs would have stood down if Korra walked out of there carrying Kuvira's body? I don't.\n\nThe Last Airbender was the story of an Airbender named Aang becoming the Avatar. The Legend of Korra is about an Avatar named Korra becoming the woman she is on the inside. She was no longer defining herself by her title, and has started to live life.\n\nResponse B Author: themcos\n\nResponse B: \nUm... Not sure what series you watched, but Asami is *not* a minor character. She's very clearly established as part of Legend of Korra's \"Team Avatar\". She was a main character in all 4 seasons, and had a boatload of 1:1 team up action with Korra in Season 3 in particular (remember when she busted them out of airship jail and then built them a new ride from the damaged parts?) I'm puzzled why you consider her \"seemingly minor\" while you don't seem to have a problem considering Mako an important character, even though his season 4 arc was pretty much a glorified baby sitting job for Prince Wu.\n\n\nI'm hearing alarm bells every time you use the word \"seemingly\" for some reason :) I don't understand what you're saying here at all. But you reiterate the notion again when you say:\n\n\nI don't understand at all the notion that Korra's relationship (however you choose to interpret it) in any way takes away from her strength or independence. Like, I honestly don't get what you're getting at here. How does Korra wanting a relationship (and actively pursuing what she wanted - *Korra* had the idea for them to take a trip together) make her any less strong? I have a wife that I love. Would you consider me a \"stronger\" person if I were single? I just don't get it.\n\n\nLook, I don't want to play at the foreshadowing / when did they decide this game, because we're not the writers, but I honestly feel like you just haven't been paying attention during seasons 3 and 4. Korra very clearly started to establish *some kind* of special friendship with Asami early in Season 3. The extent to which there were romantic undertones can be debated, but some sort of unique relationship was clearly there. If you disagree with this, I don't know what to say other than to go back and rewatch the show. This relationship continued (and became more complicated) when Korra was poisoned and there was a mail correspondence (or rather *non* correspondence), and then when they reunited at the restaurant with Mako and Wu. I do feel that as a character, she got crowded out a bit in the second half of season 4 by Varrick/Zhu Li in terms of plot contributions, but as far as her relationship with Korra, that's neither here nor there. Anyway, no I don't think this came out of left field as you say, and if you go back and rewatch the series, I think you'll have a tough time defending that assertion.\n\nAs for a \"resolution\" to the series, I'm not sure what you want. Kuvira's storyline was wrapped up with a bow (and a pair of handcuffs). Wu has a plan for the future of the Earth kingdom (not sure what more you wanted to see there). The air nation was season 3's storyline. Its been back for three years. Again, what more are you looking for? Varrick/Zhu Li were married, so their arc is wrapped up. Bolin's story was taking a stand and winning back Opal, which was already resolved nicely (with him earning the trust of the beifong sisters as well.) Mako didn't have much of a season 4 arc, which is why his pseudo \"self sacrifice\" felt awkward and forced to me, but I guess he can take some credit for turning Wu into less of a dope. Asami didn't have a ton to do in Season 4 compared to earlier seasons, but when she was onscreen, her focuses were building trains and robots (check) and her relationships with her father (check) and Korra (checkmate, whether you noticed it or not). As for Korra, she overcame her physical and emotional roadblocks. Maybe you think the last few minutes could have been better spent, but I just don't see all these dangling loose plot threads that you do.\n\nAnd if there's one thing I know about Korra, its that she doesn't give a shit what you think. Good for her for seeing what she wants and taking it.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author BenIncognito's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I like reading a physical book because I can highlight, mark pages, reread at will, and do so at my own pace. I tend to read quite a bit faster than the standard audiobook, so listening can sometimes be frustrating and slow. Furthermore, if I'm rereading a book or a series (like I am with the asoiaf series currently) I like to be able to skim unimportant parts and look for some of the foreshadowing and possible leads on where the story might go from there. \n\nThere are some positives to audiobooks too, like being able to passively listen in the car or during a workout, but I prefer the physical pages. \n\nWhich medium you prefer depends on what kind of person you are, but the two ways of consuming the material are vastly different in how you can interact with the text, as well as where you can consume it. You might like them equally, but they they are not even close to \"the same.\"\n\nResponse B Author: andjok\n\nResponse B: When you listen to someone else read the book, they are interpreting it, which shows in the tone and inflections of their voice.

They result in improved commerce and lower goods prices, so that's the benefit you receive.\n\n2-Iagree that driving is a necessity in many parts of the country, and that alternative forms of transportation like buses and bicycles don't quite make up for the difference.  However, this seems like an argument for doing a better job of funding transit rather than issuing default licenses to people who haven't proven that they can't drive safely.\n\nMind giving us some examples of what you think are rights vs privileges?

What you are essentially talking about is \"front office\" vs. \"back office\" work. Front office work generates revenue, whereas back office work is a cost needed to run the front office. Front office means sales, developing new products, and making relationships with clients. Back office means IT, marketing, and operations. \n\nUnfortunately for the back office, their work is never as highly valued as front office work. A front office can get by without a back office, though they will be less efficient. A back office has no purpose without a front office. It's like playing defense in a basketball game. It's important, but a fantastic offense can get by without much defense, but a great defense still needs offense to score points.\n\nEveryone from car insurance companies to cable TV promises to save us money (\"Save 15% by switching to Geico.\") Very few people offer to give us cash directly, and when they do, we value those relationships highly. The non-working spouse is in the former category, whereas the working spouse is in the latter. Luckily, most people base their relationships on love and mutual trust/respect, and not on rote financial value.\n\nResponse B Author: TheNicestMonkey\n\nResponse B: \nThis is entirely dependent on the household in question. Single people, for example, do *not* find their time split up in the way you've described. All the cooking, cleaning, billing, etc does not take up 40 hours per week. And while this work does increase when you have a partner it's not a linear increase. Cooking for two takes more time than cooking for one - but it doesn't take twice as much time. \n\nTherefore in the absence of additional work (raising a child) I think it's highly unlikely that a non-working spouse is actually *working* 40 hours per week.

While they served their purpose in older times by storing value in the coin's material itself, it has no place in our modern debt based, fiat economy.\n\nCoins jingle and scratch things and take up space and weight. They always require some kind of special slot or pouch, refusing to properly fit into ~~traditional~~ pouchless wallets.\n\nOn the other hand, flat notes are lightweight, cheap to manufacture, and space-efficient. Yes, they are more perishable (especially US bills), but that either makes the case for more durable notes or they are sufficiently durable; they already represent the highest denominations of cash anyway.\n\nCollectors can be satiated by printing special edition notes instead of special edition coins.\n\nIs there a good reason to keep coins?\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: Coins are already non-specie, so that argument is moot.\n\nSo the first question you have to ask, is if the units they represent are still valuable.  I believe so, because inflation hasn't yet reduced the cent to non-value, and people do use them.\n\nOk, next question.  You have to ask if the wear and tear is worthwhile.  Given that coins in circulation can last decades while bills may only last months, the cost effectiveness may not be there for the sheer number of them.\n\nBesides, using automatic machines, coins are a lot more reliable than bills in my experience.\n\nResponse B Author: Duffman1701\n\nResponse B: How do you feel about getting rid of the Penny?  It costs more than one cent to make a penny, and mining the metals for them is terrible for the environment.  People don't tend to spend them, they just get them in their change and let them accumulate.  Occasionally they'll roll them up and exchange them at banks for paper money.  \n\nThis is essentially the case in Turkey.

CMV\n\nOp: Frankly discussing the causes, effects and potential remedies of the obesity epidemic often gets derailed because someone starts worrying who might take offense. Same goes for race relations and anything related to women.\n\nShutting down the discussion because someone might cry about it or shaping the whole debate to not step on toes is intellectually dishonest. Anyone who comes in and starts talking about who might be offended is doing everyone a disservice because ultimately those feelings are only slightly relevant to the issue at hand, be it obesity, rape, racism, or whatever else gets people up in arms.

I think you're thinking in terms of altruism, which I agree makes sense for the mass appeal. But when it comes to discussion, or any interaction with other people, feelings are going to be a factor. That doesn't mean they can't keep their feelings under control.\n\nBut for instance, when it comes to race, it's easy to just have a discussion about race, but if it's to be a fair discussion it should include members who have actually experienced racism. And these people are likely to have developed feelings toward the topic- feelings that I'd argue are much more relevant to the issue than someone who's just discussing it \"in theory/in general\". And I think you should care, because if someone has strong feelings about a topic that you don't share, then they may very well have more insight and experience into it than you do, and you may be the one who stands to learn something that actually applies to the general population.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author NapoleonChingon's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Most sports during and months prior to their season have practice 5 times a week, and often 6. And these are many hour long practices, taking up there whole evening. I hear students talk about how they can never do anything except sports and schoolwork. Then they are shamed for quitting. \n\n\n* Speaking of taking a lot of time, it seriously effects grades. Football players are stereotyped with bad grades, but I don't think it is because they are dumb, they just have no time for anything. Homework at my school is already tough enough, there is no need to make it harder for them.\n\n* It is almost impossible to join a sport \"just for fun\". If you want to try something new -which high school is all about- you are expected to go to practice so much it just gets rid of the fun. Sure, there are a couple of rec leagues, but I am talking about the level of competitiveness is generally just too high. \n\n\n* There are a ton of injuries, that often will have a permanent effect on people for the remaining 60 years of their life, over a sport that they had basically zero chance of going pro in. It seems that all the time people are getting concussions and tons of bad knees, and every once in a while, a serious injury occurs. \n\n* I hate to be blunt, but the statistics show that for even the best athletes the chance of going pro is very extremely low. About one in 3 people I know want to be pro athletes, and in reality, probably none of them ever will.\n\n\n\nExpected arguments\n\n\n\n* Sports build character of working hard.\n\nI agree with this, except my argument is that they are going to far with it. A lot of my friends that don't do sports often seem to have more motivation than people that do.\n\n* Sports help keep kids in shape.\n\nAnother thing I agree with, but that is hypocritical when literally every thing in the lunch room is full of carbs. There is also a lot of other things you can do to keep kids healthy without all of the cons above.\n\n\nI know that there will always be that one super competitive high school, but I think the bar should be lowered all around for kid sports. \n\n**CMV!**\n\n\nAnd shoutout to /u/lordpancake78 for making a very very good aregument (although I am not sure that I have changed my mind.\n\n\nResponse A Author: lordpancake78\n\nResponse A: As a fellow high school student, I have to agree that most of, if not all of what you said has a lot of value.  But from a different viewpoint, sports are taken seriously because sports are FUN.  I played football for eight years through school not because I was good or I felt like I needed to be because I loved to play football.  My teammates loved football and so did my coaches.  We were a team and we cared for each other.  We even went camping once a year for 4 days together, we were more than a team, we were a family to.  It was worth it to stay up late doing homework because we were doing something we loved after school. \n\nAlso, I particularly loved football because it was an excuse to hit, tackle, and fight.  Humans were evolved to be vicious and tenacious, while intelligent.  Sports are a good way (at least for those I know) to release evolutionary desires to use our natural abilities without actually fighting for survival.\n\nResponse B Author: goplaymariokart\n\nResponse B: I'm a little late to the party but I can still offer my experience as an athlete. I was a swimmer for 10 years and it took up a lot of time. I don't think it affected my grades like you said, I always had more than enough time to balance a social life and schoolwork outside even with two a day practices my entire high school career.

CMV\n\nOp: My argument has two points.\n\n1. STEM majors learn marketable skills. Engineers and doctors solve problems using science. Scientists apply critical thinking to understand the workings of the universe. Graduates with humanities degrees don't have much to contribute to the betterment of society in comparison.\n\n2. Society is better able to use a large number of STEM majors.  As society advances, it will continuously increase in demand for STEM majors to repair and create technological infrastructure. On the contrary, the demand for humanities majors won't scale any faster than linearly.\n\n\nThings I am not arguing:\n1. Humanities are less difficult than STEM. Although personal experience has suggested this, a similar CMV has presented good arguments against it.\n2. Humanities are worthless. I am only saying they have less worth to society than STEM fields.\n\n\nResponse A Author: Parallel_Octaves\n\nResponse A: I think the most important aspect of this argument that tends to be ignored is the purpose of undergraduate majors. The main argument of the STEM field side seems to be that the purpose of higher education and of the college major is vocational training. With the exception of very specific and focused degrees, I would argue that this isn't the case. \n\nAs I've seen it, the purpose of higher education is to teach an individual to think in certain ways. Take for example a course in math. Most colleges require quite a bit of math for an engineering major. Much of this education is either tangentially relevant or applicably useless given the current ability of calculators and programs such as Wolfram Alpha. Even for someone majoring in math and thinking of pursuing a PHD, many of the courses they take will be less than relevant given the incredibly specific nature of mathematical research. The purpose instead is to teach the kind of critical thinking and problem solving abilities that would be useful in the field. \n\nWhile I think the introduction to a field is definitely helpful, it's certainly not critical. You will see liberal arts and humanities majors in design firms and STEM fields. In many of those positions the ability to write eloquently and argue your position might be just as useful as technical knowledge. You see a lot of colleges nowadays stressing writing skills within their engineering program. \n\nOne of the best ways to describe this is with the missile analogy. Let's say you're an engineer at the pentagon working on missile designs. You're incredibly knowledgeable about airflow, fin design, and motor design. Maybe your boss understands cares about these things. His boss however is only concerned about three things, how far the missile goes, how fast it goes, and how big a whole it will make when it hits. Technical aspects of any field are important but equally important are real applications of those technical aspects. Diversity in viewpoints and was of thinking an looking at problems are just as important as specific knowledge. Specific knowledge can always be picked up far more easily than critical thinking. \n\nTL:DR In most cases, studying in certain fields is not vocational training. Major teaches you how to critically think in certain ways. This is what's important in most fields.\n\nAlso: Princeton's website claiming that half their med-school acceptances were not hard science. \n\nhttp://www.princeton.edu/majorchoices/myths-about-majors/\n\nResponse B Author: WorldsEndGirlfriend\n\nResponse B: \nNot everyone can study engineering or computer science. The more engineering majors you have, the less valuable each one will be and more competitive  \n\nSTEM majors aren't some golden tickets for a job. You'll realize aside from engineering, most majors don't lead directly to a job and that you'll have to compete for one already. \n\n\nAny major as long as you have taken the pre-med requirement can attend medical school. I know many people who have studied non STEM majors, who learned many valuable skills such as how to communicate effectively and think critically (I don't understand why you think this is STEM exclusive, especially when Bio/Chem majors are set on rote memorization) How does analyzing literature or studying philosophy not teach you critical thinking? \n\nYou're focusing way too much on college majors. Undergraduate is meant to educate you and help with your first step, not define you. Don't look at it in such binary matter where STEM is defined to be one thing, and non STEM is defined to be another. \n\nIt's up to the individual to make something of oneself and contribute to society. Look at the Ivy Leagues, considered to host the brightest students in the country. Most of them aren't STEM majors, but they will probably accomplish more than your average joe who studied biology at a no name college.

A common refrain to this point is \"but never at this speed!\" This is simply incorrect; there have been many mass extinctions in the past 3.6 billion years, yet life continued, eventually allowing our species to evolve. Having an unknown outcome does not mean we can ignore probability, and it is unlikely that the loss of a few species (or even many) will present a challenge to the adaptability of life (or human life) on earth.\n\nSo, please, CMV.

However, I do think we should, as much as possible, avoid causing harm that could result in extinction. \n\n2) Benefits to humans\n\nI agree, the ecosystem is not generally fragile as a whole; life can adapt to a variety of conditions. However, specific areas can have fragile ecosystems, in which animals and plants are codependent on each other for survival, and the removal of certain organisms (commonly known as keystone species) can have large impacts on other organisms. This means that plants or animals that we use as resources, such as medicinal plants, may be harmed if we try to eliminate a bug that helps it pollinate, something along those lines. It's in our best interest for diversity to exist, and be sustainable, so that we can use those resources to improve ourselves. By preventing the extinction of species through things such as poaching, over-farming (ex: buffalo), it makes it more practical to maintain and harvest resources.\n\nResponse B Author: Zorander22\n\nResponse B: Are those emotional arguments not important? Arguably, most arguments of what we _should_ do come down to axioms that are supported in part because of their emotional appeal. If life is something we value, and our experience of the world is richer for having more biodiversity, isn't that something we should consider?\n\nAlthough, as you say, life continued during previous mass extinctions, by definition much of life did not survive. If we lose enough supporting species, it is possible that human life could end, and likely that humanity would be negatively impacted (by loss of food sources, sources of new drugs, etc). Life is intimately connected, and organisms directly and indirectly affect each other in many different ways. If you lose an entire species, you affect the species that fed on them or that they fed on, which affects others in all kinds of different ways. The ability of life to go on relatively smoothly is due to the biodiversity we have today, but as that diversity decreases, there are greater and greater chances of large impacts.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author halcyon950's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

We don't always give everyone the same chances, but that's not what this question is about. There is a huge distribution of income even among college graduates - if we've given them equality of opportunity, why should we try to ensure equality of outcome?\n\nEven the top paid CEOs are paid that much because we live in a capitalist society and that's how much their company is willing to pay them.

Resentment is when you wish that, even if you can't have what they have, at least they could be as poor as you. *Equality* is when, regardless of whether you are poor or rich yourself, you want your society's laws and social structure to benefit everyone equally.\n\nYou could compare this to attitudes towards criminals. A desire for revenge is equivalent to resentment - you want the guy who committed a crime to suffer as much as, or more than, he made you suffer. Equality is equivalent to justice - you want the laws and law enforcement set up so that no one has the ability to get away with commiting crimes against anyone else.\n\nNote that even if you, as a victim of a crime, feel no desire for revenge and don't want a man who robbed or assaulted you to suffer in any way, the fact that you personally forgive him doesn't give you a right to stop the government from prosecuting and punishing him, because the goal of the justice system is to protect *other people*, not to give you revenge. Even if there were no vengeful people in the entire nation, there would still be a justice system to protect people and punish criminals. Likewise, even if you personally don't resent rich people or want to see them suffer for its own sake, that doesn't mean you should support the unequal system that raised them above other people.\n\nResponse B Author: AlbertDock\n\nResponse B: We don't live in a totally capitalist society. If we did there would be no police force and no army. It would be up to each individual to protect their own assets. If people want to be protected by society they must contribute.

This manifests itself differently in each country. For example, in France, leftist economists such as Piketty will be far more successful in academia. In all regions, the subject matter is often dangerously unscientific. Even semi-scientific disciplines such as linguistics are marred by ideologic cancer.\n\n2) **Some subjects are intellectually worthless and/or bullshit factories.**\nThe [Sokal hoax](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair) is a good example of this. Basically, nothing of cultural or practical value is produced. Sadly, philosophy often falls victim to sterile debates of this sort (are humans animals? What is art?)\nThe intellectual purity of mathematics and physics cannot be surpassed.\n\n3) **Many problems outlined by philosophy can only be solved by modern science.**\nNeurologists, empiricists, inventors can give actual solutions instead of spending their time making assumptions or formulating unverifiable hypotheses. There is no potential limit to what science can accomplish. It's entirely possible that conundrums such as free will can and will be solved soon. There is nothing a philosopher can do that a scientist can't. In fact, the best philosophers tend to be scientists. Science is the only thing that has reliably brought solutions thus far. Even things such as large-scale democracy are only the result of increased wealth caused by tech. The only long term changes brought upon humanity were the result of tech.\n\n4) **The best students gravitate towards STEM**\nThe humanities tend to attract bad students because the subjects are much easier and more open to interpretation, whereas in science rigor and hard work cannot be escaped. I remember back in high school that the best science students were also the best at humanities. They had the most vocabulary and the most extensive cultural knowledge, the best analytical skills and the best taste.\nThere are way too many mediocre students in the humanities who end up never creating anything of value. That's why humanities in college are a joke.\n\n5) **People good at the humanities don't need to study them.**\nWithout art, culture etc. life wouldn't be worth living. A world with only engineers would be a nightmare. However you'd have to be naive to think that studiying humanities in college makes you talented. Great writers don't emerge because of shitty creative writing classes in college or english lit. Great painters don't need art history. Great thinkers manage on their own. Their talent is far beyond what can be taught in school. The production of culture is rarely the result of punctilious study.\n\nSo far these are the conlusions I've come to. Obviously being in STEM does not make you a genius, but the basic point is that a humanities degree is much more likely to be worthless, both practically and intellectually. It's more likely that a given student gravitated towards humanities out of laziness instead of interest. Culture is amazing but is almost never the result of traditional humanities teaching.\n\nTL;DR I'm bitter about my educational choices\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\nResponse A Author: JizzCat\n\nResponse A: STEM students design bombs, humanities and social science [1] students determine whether/when they will be dropped. No scientific formula can determine the latter. \nLikewise, STEM students design life saving technologies, but humanities and social science students determine whether people will get them, and design the social structures that make that research possible. \n\nHumanities and the social sciences are not totally objective because of the nature of their subject matter. Societies cannot be put in a lab, but  the fact that a subject matter is harder to study is not a reason to not throw it to the side. Progress *is* made on philosophical and political questions - i.e. the Enlightenment. \n\nI don't think the Sokal hoax doesn't do as much for you as you think. Sokal deliberately picked a journal that doesn't use peer-review and sent an article with a monstrous 33-page bibliography and 12 page of footnotes. The editors asked him informally to change the form of the article and cut down on the end-matter, and Sokal refused. The only reason the (admittedly bad) editors didn't scrap the article entirely was because they were so excited that he was a leading scientist attempting (in bad faith, as it turns out) to bridge the gap. They sat on the article for a while until an issue on Science came out.\n\nI love and have immense respect for science, but uncritical approaches towards it that don't take into account political and philosophical concerns, can produce horrendous results. See: scientific racism/sexism, phrenology, eugenics, etc. Further, sociological studies on science (see Bruno Latour) show that the process of making scientific discoveries is saturated with non-objectivity. \n\nI'm sorry you've met humanities students who weren't up your intellectual standards, I have too. But I've also met STEM students with repugnant views on militarism, the working class, and gender. However, I don't think that this is generalizable to an entire field of study. \n\n[1] Notice I say \"humanities and social sciences\", not just humanities like in your post. The two are overlapping but distinct and shouldn't be conflated. Economics is not in the humanities. \n\nResponse B Author: Prometheus720\n\nResponse B: I think you're making one of two mistakes. Either:\n\n* You're confusing personal studies with studies in an educational institution\n\n* You simply phrased your title badly\n\nA study of the humanities is absolutely vital to anyone I'm interested in speaking with. If you don't understand and interact humans, I don't give a damn if you're a whiz with a computer. You might as well be one. History, philosophy, psychology, and economics are all important topics. I would agree with you that a PH. D in philosophy (which is redundant, by the was, as Ph. D stands for something like doctorate of philosophy) is about as useful as half a one-dollar bill, but that does not mean that the study is not useful.\n\nPhilosophy does answer a lot of questions that science can't. As others have said, it answers why. It also answers should we. Furthermore, it's almost a necessity if you are nonreligious. Religious people can use a prescribed morality and philosophical worldview, but atheists and skeptics have to form their own or at least go search for one. \n\n\nLong story short? If you want to make money, do STEM and slave away for a corporation. If you want to make something, learn how and then learn about business. If you want to make a rich, happy life, you need to be able to deal with your own head first.

CMV\n\nOp: I feel most music since I have been alive (1993) just has not been on par with anything made before. It seems like starting around 1990 there was a sizable dip in originality of music, and songs were churned out of over-hyped, over-sexualized artists. These songs lack originality in many ways that I have noticed:\n\n**Ear-pleasing guitar riffs have morphed into electronic beats**\n\nPart of this drop in the quality of music comes from this. In today's music, instead of having a writer who understands music theory, one just needs a computer, a program or two, and a singer who appeals to the broadest demographic. There is no talent involved in creating music anymore. To further on the topic of writing...\n\n**Writing quality has diminished**\n\nWhat happened to writing a song about something that has happened to you, or made an impact on you or someone important to you? One of my favorite songs, \"Hey Jude\" by The Beatles, was written by Paul McCartney [to comfort John Lennon's five year old son, Julian](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=141). Today, music is all about sex, drugs, money, cars, etc. And it's not to say it wasn't in what I like to call \"The Golden Era\" (dates in title) as well, but it sure feels to me those had more substance and meaning.\n\nI'm going to take an artist as an example here and use Taylor Swift. I don't know what your opinion is of her, but like most I encounter, it seems to be either you like her or you don't. What can't be argued is the fact that she wrote or co-wrote every song she has released. Not to add that she can play an instrument (guitar). I'm looking at you, Katy Perry. However, it seems to me the side of not liking Swift is ever-growing, even as her songs and writing continue to grow and evolve. (Yes, I'm a fan.) I don't understand how someone such as her can be chided for her music when many of today's star simply get fed complete songs and only go out and sing (assuming they don't lip sync).\n\nI would further like to add I do listen to the same type of music I'm complaining about sometimes; I'll admit, some songs are pretty catchy. I would take 100/100 times listening to \"Freebird\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd and know someone actually wrote that than listen to Miley Cyrus, though.\n\nOne last thing that I'll leave right here as a semi-important footnote: [top 500 songs of all time by Rolling Stone](http://www.metrolyrics.com/rolling-stone-top500-1.html)\n\n^the ^highest ^from ^1990 ^on ^is ^number ^nine\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: FaerieStories\n\nResponse A: Your argument is essentially a more eloquently expressed version of that old Youtube comment classic: *\"I was born in the wrong generation! Nirvana and Queen are real music - not Katy Perry and Justin Bieber! Thumbs up if you agree!\"*\n\nThe problem with both your argument, and the argument of the kids on Youtube that write the above is this: you are comparing the classics of yesterday with the run-of-the-mill pop crap of today. The 60's-80's had their fair share of crappy, mediocre artists interested only in profit as well, but guess what? We don't remember them because it's only the decent artists - the ones that actually care about what they do - that live on. Do you think people will remember Katy Perry in 50 years time? People in the year 2060 will look back at the early 21st Century and say: \"those were the glory days. Back then, artists really cared about their music rather than money. Those were the days of Radiohead and Streetlight Manifesto and Arcade Fire - bands that really loved what they were doing and really meant something. Not like today's commercial crap\".\n\nIt's the same with any artistic medium. The classics survive, the commercial dross is forgotten. Do you think Twilight will be studied in 50 years time like the works of Orwell are? Do you think Transformers will have the sort of fan-base Blade Runner does? **The reason why you think that older music - music before your time - is better is that it's easier for you to find great older music, because the bands from 50 years ago that are still remembered today are the ones that have stood the test of time.** Searching for good music in the present is much more tricky - not because there's less of it (because arguably there's actually far, far more), but because you don't get the convenient filter of 'music that has had lasting impact' and thus you have to wade through all the fads of the moment that the general public lap up in order to find the good stuff.\n\nMy advice? Find a genre you like and explore it properly. There is such a goldmine of talent out there in every genre that it's almost daunting to start - but services like Spotify and Last.fm really help to discover new bands. Only a fraction of that is electronic music - just because the top 40 is filled with electronic music doesn't mean all other genres are. That said, great electronic music does still exist. Check out Caravan Palace for example, or Ratatat.\n\nSo basically my question to you is: how much have you *really* explored modern music? What sort of genres are you into? \n\nResponse B Author: sloggz\n\nResponse B: The reason you like music that is 20+ years old is because the worst, throw-away crappy music (which was popular in its time) hasnt remained popular. Call it the filter of time. There's plenty of amazing music being made now, but you wont find it on top 40 stations (for the most part), and I garentee you that in 20 years the youth will be writing posts just like this but with the dates being from 1990-2010, and their examples being Arcade Fire (\"In the back seat was written about her dead parents! So much more moving than technospazjam 2033\")\n\nMy only advice is to explore more modern music.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author FaerieStories's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Known socially as:Black.\n\nTiger Woods:Black, Asian, Indian, Caucasian. Known socially as:Black.\n\n~~Mitt Romney-European and Latino ancestry. Known socially as:White.~~\n\nGeorge Zimmerman-Half hispanic/ Half white. Known socially as:White.\n\nEach of these people brings up an interesting side of biracial perceptions. It used to be that any race mixed with caucasian would automatically be cancelled out. Obama is half black, half white, but people call him black, Tiger Woods is an amalgamation of racs and people call him black. \n\nHowever in recent years, these social rules seemed to change somewhat with racially charged cases like Zimmerman being referred to as white, despite having a \"darker\" race of peruvian ancestry from his mother's side. ~~Romney himself does not acknowledge as latino, even though George Romney was from Mexico, defaulting to white to appeal to his base.~~ \n\nWhat is the point of all of this? It's that our terminology for classifying people seems to be outdated as more and more biracial people have come into American life and we need to rethink the logic behind it.\n\nSome might say that it's wrong to label people, but identity is important. Obama has written about how he struggled to decide whether he was white or black as a youth, a society that could barely understand the idea of mixed race forced him to choose between one side of his ancestry or the other, when he should have accepted both. \n\nTiger Woods calls himself \"Cablinasian\" or \"Multicultural.\", which gives a fair homage to all sides of his family. Referring to someone who is biracial by only one of their races ultimately discredits one or more people who played a part in that person being alive. Whether it is done socially, ~~or whether it is done voluntarily like with Romney (which is still brought by social pressures.)~~, I think that this approach of categorization is fundementally wrong and illogical because it ultimately makes a person deny a big part of themselves and their family. \n\nInstead of referring to someone of mixed race as one race, there should be new terms invented to better suit who they are. Wood's approach with \"Cablinasian\" and other variations such as \"Eurasian\" or simply \"Multicultural\" being accepted into mainstream culture would be of a great benefit and a welcome addition to the lexicon for a society becoming more and more multicultural by the day.\n\nThat's my stance, please change my view.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: KerSan\n\nResponse A: I don't understand why identifying as a particular colour is in any sense a way of choosing your identity. For example, I'm mixed (won't say the exact mix to protect my anonymity, but it's a somewhat complicated mixture). I've been mistaken for all sorts of things, though typically people think I'm latino or middle eastern (I'm neither). But you know how I identify myself if anyone asks? Third generation Canadian.\n\nI'm going to go a bit further. Black is not a race. There are more races in Africa than in the rest of the world combined. Pygmies are *very* different from Bantu, even though both are listed as black. Even describing Obama's father as Kenyan misses a lot. Was he Bantu or Nilotic or Cushitic? Something else? Black is a description, because most people don't have much of a clue about the strong cultural and ethnic differences in parts of the world not their own.\n\nHow do you refer to Indonesians? Do you distinguish between the Javanese and the Sundanese? They sure do. These people have been distinct for much longer than the existence of any one of these modern countries. To identify a man by his country is not to identify him by his race. There are no racially homogenous countries. My guess is that most people in North America would call them Asians, but they're all quite different from Chinese and Indians (though there are many Indians in Indonesia). And even talking about \"Chinese\" or \"Indian\" is to lump together a range of ethnic groups more diverse than all of Europe. The differences between a Tamil and a Punjabi are gigantic. The Punjabi language is closer to English than to Tamil, because Punjabi and English are Indo-European languages whereas Tamil is a completely different language group: Dravidian.\n\nBut in any case, I think races are a total fiction. Like, completely made up. The example I give is that Alice of race A marries Bob of race B and they have four kids, Charlie, Christina, David, and Delilah. Charlie and Christina marry persons of race A, David and Delilah marry persons of race B, and they all have kids. All of Charlie and Christina's descendants marry persons of race A, all of David and Delilah's descendants marry persons of race B. So Alice and Bob's great grandkids' great grandkids are each either 127/128 race A or 127/128 race B (if I counted that right). But the descendants of Charlie are just as closely related to the descendants of Christina, David, and Delilah... even though Charlie and Christina's descendants are predominantly race A and David and Delilah's descendants are predominantly race B.\n\nOf course, what happens after seven generations or so is that *the definition of race changes*. Seven generations takes something like two hundred years. The people of today are not very closely related to the people of two hundred years ago, no matter who they are and who you are. No one of your ancestors from seven generations ago is related to you by more than one part in 128, if you assume no inbreeding (and eventually, there is some).\n\nSo my point is that race is a totally meaningless and fictitious label that doesn't help you to understand anything at all about a person. Those three people you listed, even the one you retracted? I'd use *one* label for them. American.\n\nResponse B Author: ricebasket\n\nResponse B: I think the basic reason why we don't do this is because humans are kind of dumb and we want to have just a few categories of people. It's not a particularly encouraging reason and is kind of depressing and sad, but the real answer to \"Why don't we say multicultural?\" is \"It would confuse people.\"\n\nAnother important thing to keep in mind is that while ancestry is also extremely important in determining race, race is somewhat of a fluid concept and what race people guess you are can have a lot to do with how you're treated in the world. Obama, Romney, and Carlos Mencia all walk into a store. Who's racially profiled to be more likely to steal something? Who gets told a golf joke by another patron? Who gets spoken to in Spanish? The other shitty thing about the world is your experience will be different depending on what you look like. And going back to point one, humans are kind of dumb and want to group people into categories they think they can understand. Using the limited language of black and white helps explain people's experiences.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author KerSan's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I thought the idea was absurd on its face.\n\nAfter some discussion, I now realize that it boils down to which idea you find to be a bigger assumption:\n\n1) True randomness (i.e. wave-function collapse)\n\n2) The many-worlds interpretation\n\nI still think wavefunction collapse violates Occam's razor.  But now I see that's it's because I think true randomness is more absurd than many-worlds, and I can see that people who disagree on that would feel differently about wavefunction collapse.\n\n\nIt amounts to saying that the laws of physics dictate quantum outcomes on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn other words, on top of the laws of gravity, magnetism, etc., there are a ton of laws that look like this:\n\n\"At 12:31:07.876 03/04/2012, particle #1244536546458 will collapse into state #547643543257.\"\n\nThat's just about a worst-case scenario for Occam's razor.  It involves so many assumptions you would need *scientific notation* to count them.  It might even be an infinite number of assumptions.\n\nWhen that's the alternative, I will take *any* other explanation, even if it involves parallel universes.\n\nYET MORE EDIT: /u/sm0cc convinced me that this just depends on whether you're concerned with practical prediction-making, or the philosophical nature of reality.  At this point, I think my disagreements with modern physics have been resolved. :)\n\n----------------------------------------------\nOriginal post:\n\nAs I understand it, modern quantum physics claims that when a wavefunction is observed, it \"collapses\" into a single state.\n\nI believe that, if wavefunctions did *not* collapse, we would expect to make exactly the same observations.  Thus, the idea of \"wavefunction collapse\" is unnecessary, and violates Occam's razor.\n\nFor example, let's consider the Schrodinger's Cat experiment, but with one change:  The scientist has three switches in front of them.  They flip switch #1 if they see a live cat, #2 if they see a dead cat, and #3 if they see a half-live, half-dead cat, or a zombie cat, or two cats, or anything else that's out of the ordinary.\n\n**These three switches give us a way to tell what the scientist experiences.**  We don't have to try and interpret the wavefunction of their brain, because they will *tell* us what they experienced, using the switches.\n\nIf wavefunctions **do** collapse, we all know what happens:  They open the box, the cat collapses into either alive or dead, and the scientist flips either switch 1 or switch 2.\n\nIf the scientist repeats the experiment and tallies the results, they will (probably) end up with about half the tallies in column 1, half in column 2, and none in column 3.\n\nNow let's consider what happens if wavefunctions **don't** collapse.\n\nThe scientist opens the box and observes the superimposed cat.  Now we have a superimposed scientist:  The wavefunction is a superimposed version of a scientist observing a live cat, who flips switch #1, and a scientist observing a dead cat, who flips switch #2.\n\nBut here's the thing:  **Switch #3 remains unflipped**.  It is not superimposed, it is simply *off*, because no part of the wavefunction corresponded to a scientist flipping it.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the scientist did not experience anything out of the ordinary - remember, if they did, they would have flipped switch #3.\n\nWe can even imagine repeating the experiment, and the wavefunction will become many superimposed versions of the scientist, observing every possible outcome.  Most of these outcomes have roughly half the tallies in column 1 and half in column 2, but none have any tallies in column 3.\n\nSo, if we are the scientist, and wavefunctions don't collapse, we should expect to observe a live cat about half the time, and a dead one the other half.  \n\nWhich is exactly what we expected if wavefunctions **do** collapse.\n\nSo why should we postulate that wavefunctions collapse?  It wouldn't change what we expect to observe, so there is no possible way to gather evidence for it.\n\n\nResponse A Author: LostThineGame\n\nResponse A: \nThis is one, amongst many interpretations of quantum mechanics.  The 'standard' interpretation is the 'Copenhagen interpretation' which has collapsing wave functions. However, there are many others, some of which do not even include collapsing wave functions. \n\n\nThe first part is true and is why there are many interpretations of quantum mechanics. The mathematics basically gives us the same predicted results, but the interpretation of what the mathematics corresponds to is unclear. \n\nWhere I disagree with your view is in your conclusion that this makes the wavefunction collapse unnecessary and violates Occam's razor. \n\nWhat you're missing is that the wavefunction idea exists as part of a larger interpretation (Copenhagen interpretation, many worlds interpretation, etc). If you remove the wavefunction collapse you must replace it with some other explanation; some of which might require MORE assumptions to be made. Therefore it does not violate Occam's razor. \n\nResponse B Author: MacDHD\n\nResponse B: \nFor the scientist to interpret the quantum superposition of the cat (Of which there can only be two: alive or dead) and flip a switch to show what he sees, the wavefunction will collapse because he observed it.\nThis act of observation is an interaction which will skew the results in the same way we cant observe the position and momentum of a moving electron.\n\n\nThe scientist would never flip switch 3 as when he observes the cat, its superposition would be determined through the interaction of observation and the scientist would conclude that the cat is alive or dead; It cannot be observed to be both at the same time.\n\n\nEvidence suggest that this is the way quantum mechanics work. Evidence includes the experiments into quantum entanglement which uses these superpositions to transmit data (In short, it is infinitely more complex)Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author LostThineGame's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

The pledge affirms allegiance to what the flag stands for, not to the country which it flies over. In other words, you pledge allegiance to an undivided, holy, free, and fair country while recognizing that you don't live in one.

Thousands or millions of soldiers are killed; not the \"elder oaks and maples\", but young men and women, often still in their teens. Similar numbers of innocent civilians - men, women, and children - are killed or displaced. You can see the survivors in refugee camps the size of cities, fighting against disease and malnutrition. \n\nWar is not a forest fire that allows for new growth. It scars the land and its people. Minefields from wars of decades past still kill. Adults and children alike maimed by bombs or bullets must still live with their disability. Think of the lost opportunity, the potential scientists and poets killed in war. Think of the effort spent in constructing a building and the effort spent in making a bomb and how when they come together all that's left is rubble. That is not progress. \n\nTalking about war as a \"natural process\" that \"eradicates old growth\" and contributes to \"human evolution\" is, I think, an overly romantic view of war. We too readily ask others to die for what we believe. Even if you are risking your life yourself, no one fights a war alone, and most of the victims never ask for it. Often we pump ourselves up with bravado and we don't look to the more difficult but peaceful solutions. \n\nIf you have a few minutes I'd suggest you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH3-Gt7mgyM), the last few minutes of *Blackadder*, a British comedy series. In it, the titular character, having failed to find a way out of the military, prepares to go 'over the top' in the First World War. Like most good comedy, it has in it deep truths, and I believe it helps to show the sobering nature of what war is really like. \n\nResponse B Author: mavriksfan11\n\nResponse B: War also causes lots of negative effects. In many cases, the result of one war has led to another, more pointless war (the Punic Wars, WWI + WWII, etc). War fuels hatred between massive groups of people, and this can often hinder progress. War leads to ignorance in the masses (due to propaganda) who only see their combatants as evil rather than people driven by the same fears and motivations they themselves are prone to. War leads to te destruction of priceless artifacts like the Buddha statues destroyed in Afghanistan or the ancient mosques and mausoleums destroyed in Mali or the Library of Alexandria.\n\nBut most importantly, if the progress inherent in war is analogous to that of a forest fire, wouldn't it also be achieved through devastating natural disasters like tsunamis and earthquakes? If the destruction leading to rebuilding is what pushes progress forward, then why don't other modes of destruction do this as well without all the negative cosequences (natural disasters often bring people together for relief rather than making them enemies)?Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Sahasrahla's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

It's better to know Fred will not be in a week ahead of time than for him to fake sick the morning of.\n\n*  It's disingenuous to offer a sick bank as employers typically act like it's the same as vacation time when hiring you, but it's only supposed to be available if you are sick.  I once was offered to leave a job with 3 weeks PTO (all one bank) for a job with 3 weeks PTO (1 week vacation, 2 weeks sick) and the recruiter tried to claim that it was just a semantic difference.  In reality to use those 2 weeks I'd have to actually be sick, or lie about it.  And even if I did lie about it, I couldn't use more than a day or two at a time, unlike vacation time.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: maxpenny42\n\nResponse A: I'm going to take a different approach. Sick time should not be counted at all. If you are really sick and contagious or otherwise not yourself enough to focus on the work, then showing up is doing more damage than it is worth. My company doesn't count any sick days against you and it is great for both health and morale. You may think it would be abused but not many people abuse it any more than they would if it counted. Most people at some point will lie about being sick whether they have X sick days or unlimited. And few are brash enough to do so frequently. If you do abuse it it is not hard to catch and reprimand.\n\nAlso vacation and personal time have important distinctions. You have to request vaca time or at least I do. You can have everyone take Monday off or some other day. Staffing issues are important so some time needs to be approved. But everyone also needs to at least a few times call off without notice no questions asked. It is important to offer both. \n\nResponse B Author: natha105\n\nResponse B: I think the real problem is that there shouldn't be paid sick day \"pools\".  Being sick is a contingent event that you can't plan for and should be accommodated by the employer to every reasonable degree.  Some people have been with a company five years and never taken a sick day.  Others get a serious illness in their first year and take two weeks off.  IF people were honest about needing time off for legitimate illnesses I don't see why sick time ought to be limited, banked, etc.\n\nThe reason companies have these different banks with rules on them is because people are dirty liars.  If you give us five sick days a year we will use the five days (unless we can \"bank\" them with the expectation of a future benefit).  If you let us take sick days as vacation days we will come to work sick to get the vacation time.  We game the system every which way we can and creating these different banks is just an attempt to reduce fraud.

However, I think the fact that a huge number of people follow teams, players, or sports in general religiously is ridiculous. When people are dying across the world due to civil war and starvation, the average person on the street knowing next to nothing about our political system, and the presence of hundreds of other actually important topics of conversation available, what the hell is the big deal about games?

It allows someone to carry a piece of home with them no matter where they are.\n    \nThis is a very grim thought, but realistically the average person cannot drastically change those bad things from happening.

Following, talking about, comparing sports teams fulfills that need. \n\nResponse B Author: Amablue\n\nResponse B: \nWhy do you pick out sports in particular here? This is true for *any* hobby.

Why are you even on reddit now? These issues are pressing and people's lives are at stake!\n\nThey carry value in that they are enjoyable to each individual person. If you argue that people have a moral duty to help others, I would argue that there is also a duty to one's self, and there's nothing wrong with having something like sports which you enjoy, even if just as a spectator.

I'm sure many of you are familiar with the subreddit /r/tumblrinaction. I'm posting here because I don't really get why so many seem to like it. I feel like I'm going crazy here, because I just realized that the sub has so many of the same qualities as /r/shitredditsays, a sub that I really dislike.  \n\nI want help to reconcile these differences.  \n\nSome things I noticed:  \n\n* Hyperbole and misrepresentation. Obviously it's a circlejerk sub, but I really feel like people there actually believe what they say about what feminists believe. I lurk /r/femradebates a lot and have learned a lot about both MRM and feminism there, and have noticed a huge disconnect between what's said there and what people circlejerk about in TiA. What TiA says about feminists is like what SRS says about MRAs.  \n\n* Outrage culture. It's been getting really bad there lately.. it used to be pretty chill but people are getting so angry and worked up that it feels really toxic now. I browse /r/tiadiscussion and a lot of people seem to agree. There was even a sticky mod post about how to deal with rage... http://www.reddit.com/r/TiADiscussion/comments/29atw2/official_discussion_thread_dealing_with_rage/  \n\n* Missing sarcasm/obvious jokes, and circlejerking about the opposition anyways. SRS does this a lot with regards to MRAs and they get a lot of flak (rightfully) for it. But then I see things like this on the front page of TiA: http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/2ag1wy/schizophrenia_does_not_exist_um_because_culture/ and am starting to think that you can post almost anything fake from Tumblr to circlejerk about.  \n\n* Starting to attract actual bigots. SRS can get really bad with the actual communists (eg. Mao/Stalin apologists) and that sucks. I'm a Muslim and I really hate how Tumblr tries to speak on our behalf, but I hate Islamophobes way more. Threads like this: http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/26ag1l/tw_real_life_british_police_let_up_to_50_girls/ were really disheartening to me especially because the article itself was so sensationalist and pretty much made shit up. I had the OP of that thread tagged as an Islamophobic white nationalist before so it sucks to see that actual bigots can get away with using the sub as a political soapbox. :( Plus the whole 4chan vs. Tumblr thing showed that there were a lot of 4chan.org/pol/ users there.. a place that's legitimately fucked up.\n\n* Touching the poop. SRS likes to see themselves as the white knights of reddit who like to call out reddit, but TiA is starting to act like ShitTumblrSays more and more. It's supposed to be a humor sub not the sub that keeps watch over the shit that Tumblrinas say. This one feels so weird... people are even starting to act like the Tumblr police: http://www.reddit.com/r/TiADiscussion/comments/2af4pv/is_there_are_way_to_report_people_on_tumblr/ that's just what SRS likes to do too when they cry to the reddit admins???  \n\n* This last one is really petty but I feel like the cult of personality around the mods has been getting a bit over the top. The mods of TiA are treated like the archangelles of SRS... it's really weird to me.  \n\nI thought about this for awhile, and I first thought that one major difference between the two subreddits is that TiA doesn't ban anybody with a different opinion like SRS does. But when I thought about it some more I realized that since SRS is so unpopular and TiA is so popular that TiA doesn't need any mod enforcement to make the sub a circlejerk. ~~I remember seeing someone try to support Affirmative Action on the sub and they got hammered with downvotes even when they were being completely reasonable.~~ (this part made the thread go in a direction i didn't care about so I'm removing it)\n\ntl;dr: I'm starting to dislike TiA because it's become like a mirror of /r/shitredditsays.

It just feels really weird to laugh at SRS types when the sub acts just like them.  \n\n---  \n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: TryUsingScience\n\nResponse A: The difference is, TiA members are pretty clear that they don't believe *all* feminists are like that, just crazy tumblrite radfems. TiA members tend to be in favor of most of the ideals espoused by mainstream feminism. \n\nPeople posting satire and troll blogs is a problem on TiA that the mods are trying to combat and usually at least some people in the comments point out that it's a troll/satire post. Whereas doing so on SRS is a banworthy offense.\n\nI'll admit the thread you linked about Islamaphobia is depressing, but I've also seen a lot of instances of people on TiA jumping all over people expressing bigoted views. \n\nResponse B Author: eye_patch_willy\n\nResponse B: As others have pointed out, people like me that check in at TiA acknowledge the underlying issues that concern the tumblerinas that we find.

If Someone wants to do meth, I don't think its the governments job to detain them. If someone decides they are willing to be a prostitute to make money, or a minor wants to sext their partner I really don't think the government has any reason to step in and punish them. The war on drugs (in the US at least) has been a huge failure, not only has it failed to dramatically lower instance of drug abuse but it has also put hundreds of thousands of Americans in the prison system. Minors have unregulated access to pretty much any illegal drug, more so than alcohol and tabacco which are regulated. \n\nI believe the government should regulate drugs, and prostitution.

The government might even need to get involved.\n\nI can't argue with kiddie cartoon porn.\n\nNudity is generally frowned upon socially, but I don't have a strong case for why it should be illegal.\n\nSexting is complicated.

I am actually interested in having my view changed.\n\nFirst, let me give you a little background to explain why I feel the way that I do about the concept of a supernatural being, particularly those held as deities by the major world religions. I was raised in a somewhat fundamentalist Christian household, and I fully believed the majority of what I was taught until around the age of 16. Even when I would question some things, I could usually find satisfactory answers to my questions through research or by talking to a pastor, youth group leader, family member or friend. However, as I got older and was became friends with people who held world views that starkly contradicted my own, I started questioning some of the more basic concepts of my faith- not out of rebellion or disdain, but simply out of a desire to learn more. In fact, at this point I thought that it was simply God\u2019s way of making me a stronger Christian, and that once I found the answers I was looking for I would be able to confidently explain them to anyone who asked me the same questions. However, as time went on, I continued to pray, read, and talk about the doubts I was having, but I ended up coming to the conclusion that there were irreconcilable contradictions within the Bible and within the concept of God (or at least the God of Christianity, at that point). When I stopped believing in God, it was not a decision, but simply a realization that I no longer thought that the things I had learned my entire life were completely true. \n\nThat all happened a few years back. Since then I have had a few back-and-forth periods between trying to believe again and completely rejecting anything having to do with religion, but as I spent more time at college and had more time to think about and explore my beliefs, I have started to feel more and more that the idea of God is no more than a fairy tale to help people feel better about a world and a life that can be somewhat bleak at times. I still try to respect my family\u2019s beliefs, because they really do try to respect mine as well, but the more time I spend apart from the church, the more I realize how silly it all sounds to me. Additionally, I have now had some time to look into other religions as well, and despite their differences (and my admittedly limited knowledge of them compared to Christianity), I find that most of them fall into the same category- fantastical stories, which are well-intentioned and (arguably) decent as moral guides, but most likely largely fictional. I acknowledge that most of the figureheads of the religions (i.e. Jesus, Muhammad, etc.) were real people, but I think they were nothing more than philosophical leaders who were deified after their deaths. \n\nSo now that I\u2019ve explained why I don\u2019t believe in any god, here is what I do believe. I believe that science represents the best of our knowledge and understanding of the world. While we do not know everything, and we never will, I do not see that as a reason to fill in the gaps with supernatural explanation. As long as we continue to pursue more knowledge and advancement through the rigor of scientific experimentation and theory, we will learn as much as we can about the universe we live in, and that is good enough for me. I believe that when we die, we simply cease to exist, and as such I believe it is important to make as much out of this life as possible. I believe that any religion is a largely primitive and illogical construct created simply out of the human desire to believe that there is more to life than meets the eye, and that religion as a whole will largely disappear at some point in the future of the human race.\n\nYou could change my view by convincing me of one of a few things. (A) I have only completely rejected religion because of my fundamentalist upbringing, and a lesser form of Christianity or some other religion might fit into a logical view of the world. (B) Science and religion (specifically one of the major world religions) are not mutually exclusive, and can instead complement one another for a more complete understanding of life.\nI should add that simply stating that believing in God would be a good thing will not be enough. Just because something would be nice or convenient does not mean I can force myself to believe it.\n\nAddendum: In case anyone is wondering, the reason I want to have my view changed is simple. Where I live, most people are religious, and I feel that it would greatly help my relationship with a lot of people if I at least believed in something, even if I never return to a full belief in Christianity. Furthermore, I am currently dating a girl who is absolutely amazing and with whom I mesh perfectly in just about every other way, but she is a Christian (although not nearly as fundamentalist as my family) and has expressed some concern about my lack of faith. While she has not tried at all to push me towards changing that aspect of myself, I would hate for that to be the one thing that stands between us and long term happiness, so I\u2019m taking the initiative. That may seem like a cheap reason to want to change my entire world view, but it is what it is- and honestly, maybe having something to believe in wouldn\u2019t be so bad for me.\n\nSo there you have it. I may be barking up the wrong tree since I know reddit doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of outspoken religious people, but if anyone feels up to the challenge, please Change My View.\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: I'm not going to try to convince you that God exists, but instead that it is possible for a rational person to believe.\n\n1. People have religious experiences all the time, which often make them more certain or even change their beliefs. You can debate how logical that is, but the descriptions that people have of their events can seem pretty strong if you assume they aren't lying/delusional.\n\n2. Many philosophers spend their entire careers arguing in favor of God from both rational and empirical perspectives. In my opinion, the hardest to deny outright is the Cosmological argument, which says that there must be an origin to everything in the universe which itself has no origin.\n\n3. Some philosophers have argued that science and religion are two completely different fields. If you aren't a biblical literalist, then you can say that religion concerns ethics and science concerns empirical facts, which are two different things. Stephen J Gould had an interesting essay in which he described \"non-overlapping magisteria\". Many mainstream religions are open to science - Roman Catholicism accepts evolution as truth, as do mainstream protestant, some forms of Buddhism, and a bunch more.\n\nI myself am agnostic at best, but I can accept religious people now (and I remember when I had a phase when I would have thought that r/atheism was the best thing ever).\n\nResponse B Author: Nixon_Cranium\n\nResponse B: If you are concerned about the illogic of belief, I have  arguments for you. \n\n1. The philosophical argument of the unmoved mover.\nSince the time of Aristotle, philosophers have argued that the universe must have been acted upon by an external force, as nothing can come from nothing. Multiverse theory would be just as illogical as a God.  You might reject this argument as proof, but it would be a logical frame work under philosophical definitions. Look up deism, unmoved mover, and the cosmological argument. \n2. Lots of things that turn out to be true seem illogical. Take the nature of light (a wave or a particle?) or almost everything about atomic theory. The point of this argument is that many things are illogical under standard thought, but are true. \n3. If I were to tell a man 750 years ago that the whole universe  was made of invisible energy, he would be right to call me insane. \n4.

My mind is entirely open to any suggestions for alternatives to the death penalty. Please CMV.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Jazz-Cigarettes\n\nResponse A: [The death penalty has no deterrent effect on crime, murder or otherwise.](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/study-88-criminologists-do-not-believe-death-penalty-effective-deterrent)\n\nIn fact, [states that still have the death penalty see *higher* murder rates than states that have banned it.](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/deterrence-states-without-death-penalty-have-had-consistently-lower-murder-rates#stateswithvwithout)\n\nAdditionally, [the death penalty is actually tremendously more expensive to the state than legal alternatives like life in prison.](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty#financialfacts) For example, in one study on the California justice system:\n\n\nSo there's pretty solid evidence that the death penalty doesn't really have any of the advantages that its supporters often assume it has, and the only reasonable alternative is life in prison without possibility of parole. It's not perfect, I won't argue that. But it accomplishes everything the death penalty does, and it does so more cheaply and with a lower risk of catastrophic errors like innocent people being murdered.\n\nBut I want to tackle your last point. Why are you not concerned about the execution of the innocent? DNA evidence is more widespread, but guess what-- the only reason we're aware we're killing so many innocent people is because of DNA evidence that sometimes doesn't become available until after we've murdered them.\n\nThink about it: if someone is convicted of a crime and sentenced to death, and DNA evidence that exonerates them doesn't surface until *after* they've been executed, then how does that help them?\n\nHere is a simple, if difficult question: how would you feel if a loved one of yours was wrongfully executed by the state? As you stood at their grave, awash in profound grief, would you find comfort in the trite, empty statement, \"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?\"\n\nResponse B Author: Grunt08\n\nResponse B: \nThis isn't true.  The preponderance of the [evidence](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/study-88-criminologists-do-not-believe-death-penalty-effective-deterrent) shows that deterrence doesn't work and it doesn't stand up to this exercise in logic:\n\nFirst, most people don't know the difference between capital murder and murder.  The standards vary, and this means that the deterrent alone isn't effective because most people don't know about it.\n\nIf they did, they would know it usually requires extensive premeditation and malice aforethought.  People who engage in such crimes generally do so believing they will not be caught.  If I think the standard won't apply to me because I'm smart enough to get away, the deterrent doesn't work.\n\nIf to solve this you decided to go the opposite direction and say that all murders would be punished by the death penalty, you would be dealing in large part with A) people who still believe they will not be caught and B) people committing crimes of passion who aren't considering the consequences in the first place.\n\n\nThis is untrue.  The money it costs to execute a prisoner is more than it costs to imprison him for life. California alone would save $120 million a year by converting their current death penalty system to life imprisonment. [http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty)\n\n\nLeaving aside for a moment that this position is an ethical black hole, let me point this out:\n\nA comprehensive review of our death penalty system shows a few things.  We are not good at determining guilt or innocence in capital cases.  Approximately 10% of people exonerated by DNA evidence (not just in capital cases) pled guilty at trial.  It is a statistical certainty that as long as the death penalty exists and we don't have telepathy as an investigative tool, we *will* execute innocent people.  We thought our investigation methods were thorough before the advent of DNA, but DNA evidence has freed 310 people from prison or death row.  If some newer, better method comes along, we will look back and realize we got it wrong again.\n\n[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-list-those-freed-death-row](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-list-those-freed-death-row)\n[http://www.innocenceproject.org/news/Fact-Sheets.php](http://www.innocenceproject.org/news/Fact-Sheets.php)\n\nFurthermore, if you condone the deaths of innocents in pursuit of collective justice, you have a simple moral imperative.  The next time a capital crime is committed near you and it becomes clear that they aren't going to find who did it, you should go to the police and confess immediately.  If you don't do this your views are hypocritical; as you would demand a similar sacrifice from others.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Jazz-Cigarettes's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

We have domesticated some animals to the point where they cannot survive in nature.  If we were to not raise them for consumption, they would go extinct.*\n\nI am not sure that I am really opposed to the extinction of species that cannot survive in nature, but if I were, I suppose we could make a small nature preserve where 1000 cows, pigs, and chickens live.  If you are going to complain about the cost, rest assured that the cost would be far outweighed by our consumption of more efficient food.\n\n*4.  If the animals are raised in a humane way and slaughtered painlessly and without causing them any fear, what\u2019s the problem?*\n\nI\u2019m not 100% sure why I feel like it is wrong.  But I do know that if someone liked to adopt puppies, treat them humanely, and then execute them in a painless manner just for fun, it seems morally reprehensible to me.  Maybe someone can explain why I feel this way or convince me that it\u2019s ok.\n\n*5.  Killing dogs for fun is ok because they don\u2019t have a soul or aren\u2019t self-aware or something like that.*\n\nI don\u2019t think there is anything fundamentally different about a dog and a human that would make it ok to kill one and not the other without a pretty good reason.\n\n*6.  What about fish?  What about eggs?  What about spinach?  It\u2019s alive too.  You have to draw the line somewhere.*\n\nThat\u2019s true.  I\u2019m not sure where the line should be but I do know that pigs are as smart and adorable as dogs so I don\u2019t see why any rules of morality should extend to one and not the other.\n\n\n*7.  Animals kill other animals for food.  Is that immoral?*\n\nMany animals do not have a choice but to eat meat. In those cases it is not immoral for them to kill for food. In the cases of animals that are perfectly capable of subsisting without killing, I would say that they are behaving in an immoral way, but I don't blame them since they probably lack the reasoning capacity to think about this situation from the other creature's point of view.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: doktordance\n\nResponse A: One of the ways that I justify the morality of eating meat is in the following way:\n\nWe as humans provide a service to domesticated animals. We provide them with safety, food and shelter. In return, the animals provide us with a portion of their life span. There is a form of symbiosis here where domesticated food animals receive the benefits of human technology, but at the cost of shortened lives.\n\nThis is a bit dicey intellectually because what I'm describing is essentially an economic contract and animals are not capable of entering into such contracts of their own volition. If you could ask a cow whether it would be willing to trade a potentially long life in the wild where it may have trouble finding food, mates and shelter and faces many threats from predators, for a shorter life where its safety, shelter and food supply are guaranteed, what would it choose? \n\nPersonally, I think the cow would pick the second option, but since it's incapable of understanding and choosing which scenario it prefers, I don't see a problem with humans making that decision.\n\nNow, this assumes that we actually fulfill our end of the deal. We should be providing food animals with safe, happy habitats until the time comes for us to kill them for their meat. The current industry is definitely not living up to our end of the bargain, but morally, I think this is a decent justification.\n\nResponse B Author: z00mbinis\n\nResponse B: \nThis may have been said, so apologies if it's a repeat, but I think there's a HUGE difference between killing a pig for meat and a dog for fun.  Namely, the pig was killed to provide food while the dog (in this scenario) was killed for 'fun'.  Nothing should be killed 'for fun'.  But the farmer isn't having 'fun' while killing a pig - they are providing food for their family/nation/whatever and earning their living.\n\nIt's not the animal that matters, it's the why.  People eat dog meat in other countries - are those people killing for fun because it's a dog?  No - they're essentially killing livestock.  They are doing so to provide either meat or income for their families.\n\nIn one instance (the 'fun') the animal is being killed for no purpose other than a sadistic one.  In the other, the animal is being used to provide sustenance for another life form.  Those are two radically different things.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author doktordance's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I\u2019ve been to a few stereotypical high school parties where people have asked me why I don\u2019t drink on several occasions. I really have no specific reasons as to why I choose to abstain: I\u2019m not religious, can\u2019t dismiss it due to taste (although I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s fairly awful), have no history of alcoholics in my family, etc. I usually just go with excuses such as \u201cI just don\u2019t drink\u201d, despite wanting to respond with something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t want to become like you\u201d after seeing what drinking does to friends and classmates. As a result of not drinking I\u2019ve stopped going to parties, as have the number of invites stopped coming. Six months into university the drinking culture is even worse than before. Essentially every school event is closely tied to drinking. As I don\u2019t drink and people seem to be somewhat weirded out by that, I\u2019ve yet to attend one of these uni events. \n\nNot that I think adults or more *sophisticated* drinkers are any better. They come across to me as elitist and pretentious. \u201cOh, you\u2019re drinking *that*?\u201d, \u201cthis wine has hints of pear and an underlying smoky taste\u201d, to which I can only roll my eyes.\n\nI also dislike the notion of inebriety being seen as something desirable and cool. Losing the ability of rational thinking, depending on it as a social lubricant, having lesser-than-average consensual sex, breaking things, hurting people physically or emotionally all seem like idiotic things, even less so boasting about it. Not to mention the adverse health and economic implications that entail this activity.\n\nAt the same time I feel like an outcast among my peers.

Please CMV.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Riahlize\n\nResponse A: My previous self can relate to you, I can still relate to you a bit on this.\nIt wasn't until last year, half way through my age of 22, was I convinced to try getting \"drunk\" under a completely safe environment (trustworthy people who were experienced with alcohol, knew to keep plenty of water in me, have lots of food available, only drink while in a positive attitude to begin with and an available option for sober transportation if anything happened to me). And this opened up my mind. It blew me away that I was still \"me\" under the influence. I wasn't this person who runs loose without rules and is completely unaware of what I'm doing.\nIf you get drunk and do something stupid, chances are, the temptation to do those stupid things were already there when you were sober. It's just that alcohol lowers your inhibitions, and your temptations become easy to act on. If you're already angry, if you're already whatever, that is going to shine when you get drunk.\nSo if you work on temptations before you get drunk, you lessen the possibility of being stupid. Even when I'm drunk, I wouldn't ever get behind the wheel and think I can drive, I wouldn't imagine cheating on my significant other, I wouldn't try to fly by jumping off the roof... because those temptations are not there for me while I'm sober.\nAs for problems that actually require rational thinking, and quite a bit of it to find a solution, I can still do them while drunk, it just takes me a while. And I have an automatic reflex NOT to act until my rationality has hit me.\nMaybe other people don't react to alcohol this way and I've just been fortunate that I and those who have helped me have these experiences do in act react this way. But it's certainly not inherently bad based on how people act with it. They just don't handle it in an effective and positive way.\n\nResponse B Author: Archduke_Nukem\n\nResponse B: Not all drinking leads to inebriation, one or two drinks can give a fuzzy buzz, but you would still be able to do most things normally. \n\nWhile some consider it the height of cool to be wasted (highschool) I think a large appeal of drinking culture is the opposite. The idea is that we all get together, have some drinks, and lower our inhibitions enough to admit we are just stupid organic humans with very base needs. \n\nDrinking builds a comradery between people because you are willing to take more social risk and the group is more willing to except you due to their own inebriation. I think modern society puts so much pressure on people to follow the rules and be good little humans that it takes a drink or two for some to be able to let loose and forget these pressures (especially in a group setting someone is unfamiliar with).\n\nDrinking is something you make your own. Some abuse it, other choose not to use it. You not having a desire to drink cannot be changed by anyone but yourself. You need to find your own reasons to enjoy drinking, or decide it is not for you. \n\nIf you feel pressure for not drinking, have one bottled beer at a party then fill it with tap water the rest of the night. I do that all the time (to stay hydrated) in between beers. It gets rid of the \"Oh you're drinking water pussy?\" bro types and allows you to drink at your own pace.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Riahlize's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

These tests, I agree, should test that all applicants, regardless of sex, can perform the duties that their specific job position requires. \n\nE.g. dragging a 125# dummy 30 feet is a test for all firefighters in the [state of Massachusetts](http://www.mass.gov/anf/employment-equal-access-disability/civil-serv-info/med-and-physical-fitness-stnds/pat/firefighter-physical-ability-test-pat-events.html). There does not appear to be a different test for women on this list of tests.\n\n2) General fitness to reduce the chance of injury to the *EMT/Firefighter*. This kind of test is designed to show that a firefighter is in good shape *for themselves*, and unlikely to, for example, strain muscles using them in ways that they are likely to use them during their job. People have feedback mechanisms evolved into them to avoid this kind of injury, but this assumes that they are in good physical condition *for their body*. \n\nA test that would demonstrate that an average male is sufficiently conditioned to not injure themselves would not be an appropriate test to demonstrate that an average female is sufficiently conditioned not to injure themselves. \n\nThese kinds of tests tend to be in the form of push-ups, pull-ups, and other tests that the person is able to move *themselves* around adequately. \n\nNote that these kinds of tests aren't that common or standardized at all, but are sometimes present. \n\nSuch standards should be appropriate to a fit person of the appropriate gender, because there are significant statistical differences between the genders, and the purpose of test is related to the health of the worker, not the job they are trying to do. \n\nResponse B Author: taejo\n\nResponse B: So male EMTs have an advantage of strength (on average) over female EMTs. But female EMTs also have advantages (for example, some female patients might be made uncomfortable by male EMTs in some situations). Should we focus completely on the strength aspect, or just make sure everyone is *good enough* at all aspects of the job. Naturally, with an extreme job like EMT, there is always going to be some situations that a particular person can't handle.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author hacksoncode's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

The Second Amendment was created with the intent to create a *well regulated* militia to defend from invasion and tyranny. The United States has come a long ways from the 1700's, and no nation could ever invade in this day and age due to the nuclear threat we pose and our massive army. I understand people keeping pistols for self defense, but why would any one need something like an AR-15, which is basically the same gun that the United States Military uses. why would anyone need a weapon like that in our day and age with advanced police forces and military. its not like you are going to be attacked by roving hoards of bandits. A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny, but I don't think that is possible in this day and age, as the modern US military would crush any resistance, as they have the best tanks in the world (try shooting an Abrams) and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America, as we have it far too good. in the end, i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment, as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability, as they have been used for horrible tragedies, such as Sandy Hook and Aurora \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Nixon_Cranium\n\nResponse A: No use for assault rifles you say? Tell that to the Korean Shop owners during the LA Riots The Riots were a prime example of why the Second Amendment is relevant in the modern world. The Police forces were unable to save people from murderous hordes who looted, burned, raped and savagely murdered random people. The Koreans banded together to protect their neighborhoods and stores from the hordes thereby forming militias I don't know about you, but defending my family, my livelihood and my neighbors from packs of bandits seems like a completely reasonable usage of a weapon made to kill humans, as frankly, we sometimes need to do that. if you have ethical prohibitions against killing, consider the following: the fact that the rifles used were primarily capable of holding high capacity magazines allowed the shop owners to fire warning shots, as the large ammo capacity gave them the privilege of being able to fire multiple rounds without reloading. if they had had bolt action rifles or say 5 round magazines, they would have made every shot be a kill, as you would not be able to waste any ammo. Incidents like the LA riots can be caused by natural disasters as well, see the looting that occurred in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina A good way to view an assault rifle is like a fire extinguisher. you might never have to use it, but wouldn't it be great to have it in the event that you really needed it? Also, \"Assault Rifles\" are far from a prolific murder [weapon](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table-20)  Have you ever heard of [Afghanistan?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan) The Soviets had a modern army and great numbers, and used absolutely brutal scorched earth tactics to try to kill off the resistance, but the Mujaheddin, tribal people who used small arms, homemade explosives and scavenged equipment staved off a brutal and vast army. It is true that the US government aided the resistance, but the Mujaheddin were able to hold their own against the might of a massive and powerful nation that scoffed at the idea of civilian casualties or [war crimes] (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSoviet_war_crimes&amp;ei=fmtgU8G-HYL4yQHO0YD4BQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFp3TV9cXuttOJ3IBFDlNafmp_sXA&amp;bvm=bv.65636070,d.aWc) if a revolt were to break out in the United States, I guarantee you it would not be a cut and dry game of blow- up-the-base.  The United States has been at war with Afghanistan for how many years now? In the event of civil war, defections would be areal thing, as many soldiers would not take kindly to the idea of killing civilians.\n\nResponse B Author: mc2222\n\nResponse B: The text in the 2nd amendment includes the words *shall not be infringed*.  This very clearly indicates it is *outside* the authority of the government to regulate how people keep and bear arms.\n\n\nTo be clear, are you proposing *nobody* is allowed weapons?  or just that *civilians* aren't allowed weapons.  The later poses quite the opportunity for tyranny - yes, even today.  We are not immune to it.\n\n\n\nan AR-15 could prove useful in situations like a riot (like the Rodney King riots, for example).  Additionally, the government should not be in the business of regulating things that are *not a necessity*.  It is not within the necessary powers of government to say \"that's not a necessity, so we won't allow you to own it'.\n\n\nThis is a very dangerous mindset, and having an unarmed populus would provide 'tyrants' with an upper hand (since it sounds like you're arguing that gov't officials and agents of the government would still have weapons).\n\n\nThey *can* be used to hurt others.  Or not.  They can sit on a shelf unused, or they can defend the safety of others.  It is tragically ironic that in situations like sandy hook and aurora, people immediately call the police, because the police...have...guns...  \n\nPolice stop crimes through show of force - forbidding civilians from doing this ensures criminals who *do* have guns, have a distinct advantage.  Any law that gives a survival advantage to people who break the law, is a *bad* law.  Or, put another way, a law that gives a survival *disadvantage* to those who follow it, is a bad law.\n\nThere must be a distinction between ownership of an object (no wrong has been committed), and actions *taken with* that object.  In my mind, ownership of something should not be illegal.  But, if you cause another person harm (with *any* object - a car, for example), *that's* when something illegal has been done, and that's when the law must intervene.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Nixon_Cranium's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

The US would have continued these bombings in the event that they did not end the war with the bomb, or through some other means.

Curtis LeMay, who was very involved with the Pacific theatre during WWII, once said to Robert McNamara that if the US had lost the war, he was certain he'd have been tried as a war criminal.

Those time periods/places did not enjoy lower rates of violent death. \n\nConsider the \"wild west.\" Obviously it wasn't nearly as full of gun battles as the movies make it seem, but according [this study] (http://cjrc.osu.edu/homicide-rates-american-west-randolph-roth) the murder rate was \"extraordinarily high by today's standard.\" \n\nLooking at the rest of the thread, I think I see what might be a flaw in our collective logic. The incidents that stand out most in our heads are events like Paris or Aurora or Columbine- premeditated shootings with the intent of inflicting a lot of casualties. If the staff at Charlie Hebdo or Columbine High had guns, they certainly might have been able to end these incidents earlier. They also might have inflicted more casualties with stray bullets. These types of hypothetical calculations aren't really helpful, in my opinion.\n\nBut lets assume that more guns makes mass shootings less likely. Would this actually make a more heavily armed society a more polite one?\n\nI don't think it would, because though premeditated murders could well be less likely, accidental deaths, unplanned homicides, and suicides would like increase. \n\nThis study found that owning a gun makes one more likely to die from suicide *and* homicide. Of course, that's correlation, so there might be some third factor at play that makes gun owners more likely to b targets of crime or clinically depressed, but it certainly suggests that owning a gun doesn't automatically make you safer.\nhttp://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full\n \nWhether or not more guns would prevent events like today's isn't the issue (though I am inclined to say they wouldn't necessarily do that), it seems like a greater proliferation of weapons would be more dangerous for a number of other reasons.\n\nResponse B Author: Thriven\n\nResponse B: \nI wont go into gun problems but rather define USA's basic laws and their impact on stopping situations like the one in Paris today.\n\nAs a person living in a country with the right to bear arms, in my experience, when an incident  like this occurs there aren't many armed civilians nearby to assist. Many large cities ban concealed firearms regardless of our liberty to own weapons. Most work places ban guns from being on the premise.\n\nRecently there was the [2011 Tucson Shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tucson_shooting). I lived right down the road from where it occurred and was involved with police and media due to the relationship of the shooter and the high school he attended. It was a wild minute as the shooter unloaded 33 rounds into the crowd. When he stopped to reload he was assaulted by a bystander with a chair.\n\nThat was in the state of Arizona which is as far conservative and gun toting as it can get. I know many people who pack as if its the wild west. However, these people never seem to be armed at the time of need.\n\nThe right to bear arms is simply gun ownership. In the event of civil war between the people and the government, the people are able to fight back. Where you are able to carry your gun is situational.\n\n[University of Texas Shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman) was far more situational that would align with the OP's train of thought. A very long drawn out fire fight where police weren't equipped to deal with the gunmen. Citizens with hunting rifles fought back and kept the gunman pinned down as police entered the tower. This situation and a few others was the early starts of creating swat teams able to respond to armed gunman.\n\nFrance has gun laws allowing citizens to purchase hunting rifles with permits. In the event of something like that happening in the suburbs of France, citizens could respond. \n\nHowever, the situation is so unlikely to occur as shooters rarely take to a single place and shoot from in for such a long period of time. Most shootings happen in an instant and even armed citizens aren't aware of the situation as it is occurring.

I am neither for nor against the motion of Christian propaganda.\n\nWith that being said, I have meditated and experienced first hand the effects a large gathering of Christians can have on the mindset of a person without a belief system.\n\nAfter visiting a couple church sermons I am amazed at how fast a church is capable of taking someone with a completely opposite mindset and conforming them instantly within a couple sermons. I am even more astounded by how fast churches are capable of taking children and within a week they've got the child radically supporting an adopted belief system.\n\nI thought to myself, \"Either Christianity is so true that a good preacher can convert masses out of how obvious the belief system is, or there is some sort of fallacy going on here.\"\nHere's what might be happening:\n\nTake this first set of statements.\n\n- God exists\n\n- God doesn't exist\n\nRationally, the average person should be able to live their life with an opinion that both possible statements exist as equally as each other, even though their contradictory.\n\nHowever, the statements are usually phrased like this. - God exists. He is all loving, all powerful, and he is governing the universe with his sense of perfection.\n\nThere is no god. There is no perfect, all-powerful loving being protecting us from harm. The world is not perfect.\n\nEven though both those statements have an equal value of being true, if we believe that the world is governed by a perfect, loving, supreme being, we would feel a lot happier.\n\nTherefore, before anyone even enters a church, they are already primed to want to believe one statement over the other, even though they know rationally that both statements are equal in value.\nIt's a positive outlook bias that our brain performs in order to lead our minds into believing things that make us feel good inside.\n\nNow let's look at these statements:\n\n- When we die, we are reborn and live eternally.\n\n- When we die, nothing happens.\n\nThe first statement makes you feel better, therefore you're more likely to believe it.\nWhat happens after that, is the church plays on anticipation.\n\n- When we die, we go to Heaven where we are blissfully happy and reunited with our loved ones.\n\n- When we die, nothing happens.\n\nIn the first statement, you have something to look forward to. In the second statement, you have nothing to look forward to.\n\nThis is the same as flipping a coin and getting a hundred bucks if it lands on heads. Even though you know rationally that either possibility is just as likely the other, you want to believe more that the coin is going to land on heads.\n\nSo, is the church converting massive amounts of people weekly because Christianity is so obviously true? Or do pastors already have the deck stacked in their favor before nonbelievers even walk in the door?\n\nMy view is they have the deck stacked in their favor. \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Nepene\n\nResponse A: Every religion and philosophy does the sort of thing you are talking about, tweaking its message to its audience. That's charisma 101, you adjust your words to your audience.\n\nYou can't explain why there are billions of christians worldwide by saying that a few of them are charismatic. You need something unique to Christianity that other religions don't have.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_of_Christianity\n\nChristianity has a strong history of caring for the sick. As well as this increasing their numbers during plagues, this means that while others flee to the countryside, Christianity stays within cities, the centers of power, building up their influence and numbers. Other religions often have much less of a tradition of caring for the sick.\n\nThey prohibit birth control, abortion, and infanticide. It's fairly well known that atheists and non believers in the west have a fairly low birth rate on average. This is amplified by their belief in slowing their reproduction. If Christians produce more babies and convert their babies (children are easier to convert) then there will be more Christians.\n\nThey allow women to perform worship and get involved, making their religion sexier. It's fairly well known in the modern world that many atheist groups are mostly male. e.g.\n\nhttp://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2011/02/gender-disparity-on-daylight-atheism/\n\n That means that if you join some sort of atheistic group and are a straight male you're much less likely to get laid. The same was true of many pagan religions. This meant that the rate of secondary conversions was pretty low.\n\nIf you look at the leadership of much of modern atheism, it's heavily male dominated, and women frequently complain that their concerns, as such, are not heard. This makes it less effective at converting.\n\nIf you're looking for factors that explain the rise of religion these sort of things are likely more important than rationality, which is present in every religion and group.\n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: \nThis.  This is the fallacy you're looking for.  It's not at all true that two mutually exclusive propositions have an equal chance of being true.\n\nI'll give you an example.  Let's suppose you and I are having a conversation, and I tell you that there is a tribe of invisible elves living underneath my floorboards with whom I communicate telepathically.  What would it take to convince you I was telling the truth?  If you try to come up with any empirical means for discovering the elves' existence, I'd just say they are intangible and invisible and undetectable, in other words you have to take my word for it.  Is there an equal chance that I am either right and telling the truth or lying to you?  Of course not.  \n\n**What is most likely to be true is whatever has the most evidence for it.**\n\n\nThis is a classic false dichotomy.  In other words, this is setting up the choice as if it's only between two options when in fact there are many more options.\n\nWhat you're basically saying is Christianity offers a choice between two options:\n\n1. You believe in God, accept Christianity, and go to heaven after death.\n2. You reject belief in God, deny Christianity, and go to hell after death.\n\nThis is what is known as [Pascal's Wager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_Wager), and it's a logical fallacy.  For one, what about all the other religions, why merely Christianity?  What about Islam?  What about Hinduism?  How do we know which one is right?  The choice isn't between Christianity and atheism, it's between Christianity, atheism, and about a thousand other religions.  If Christianity turns out to be wrong, and Islam is true, you're still going to Hell even though you chose religion.\n\n\nThis is also simply not true.  Where is your source for this?  Both irreligion/atheism (lack of religion) and Islamic beliefs are growing faster than Christianity.  In fact, in some countries, Christianity is on the downfall.\n\nFurthermore, it seems you have this idea of \"nonbelievers walking into the door\" as if this is a common occurence.  In reality, the **vaste majority of people who are Christian are born into Christian families**.  As somebody who was both a Christian and active participant of a Christian church for two decades, new converts who are \"unbelievers\" are very, exceedingly rare.  About 95% of Christian church goers were born into it, so any growth in the church is likely due to families having more kids. [This is precisely why Islam is growing faster than Christianity](http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/), not because it is more pursuasive, but because Islamic families are simply having more babies.\n\nSo to sum up, Christianity does not have the deck stacked in their favor any more than any other religion because the example you used of choosing between unfavorable no afterlife and the more favorable heaven could be used by *any religion*, not just Christianity.  Furthermore, Christianity is not spreading nearly as quickly as other religions and nonreligion itself.  Finally, the reason people *do* join Christianity is almost always because they were born into it, *not* because they were converted.  The number of actual converts from evangelism is strikingly low compared to indoctrination.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Nepene's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Either teaching them philosophy would focus on one philosopher or general philosophy and basically be indoctrination, or it would teach a bunch of different philosophies, which, again, kids wouldn't really be developed enough to differentiate between on a meaningful enough level to really have it shape their thought process, and therefore just be a weird social studies/history course, with a bit of science thrown in assuming you touched on the scientific method.\n\nIn that respect, the current (and by current I mean, that's what they were doing when I was in elementary school) social studies/science split seems like it would cover that without the confusion.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author [deleted]'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

You don't have to worry about it getting wet.  It doesn't take up an inordinate amount of space.\n * It's better for the environment.  Charcoal requires dead trees.  The good charcoal (not the kingston bricks) is made by slowly burning a tree for hours releasing huge amounts of smoke and debris into the atmosphere.\n * Many good grills are designed to be used with propane and it makes grilling easy for beginners.\n * Charcoal takes much longer to light.  If you're using inst-light charcoal, grilling too early is actually very unhealthy.  You have to wait for all of the coals to be completely white, or else you'll be eating the fumes from the lighter fluid in the coals.\n\n**Some of the arguments against propane are easily dispelled.  For instance:**\n\n * \"It's more dangerous\".  It's just as dangerous as lighter fluid.\n * \"Charcoal makes your steaks taste better\"  If you want a nice smoked flavor you can throw a could of wood chips on a propane grill.  And if you're getting all of your flavor from the charcoal you're not seasoning correctly.\n * \"Propane is more expensive\" That may be so but it's worth it.\n\nCMV\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: extra_homefries\n\nResponse A: I'm a gas griller, and it's for many of the reasons you listed.  However, charcoal produces a better steak.  It's not just the smoke, either, it's about temperature and the difference between convection and radiant heat.\n\nGas grills only get up to between 500 and 600 degrees Fahrenheit, some as low as 400, and most of the cooking is being done via convection - that is, heating up the air.  That's not enough (on its own) for a good Maillard reaction, which means you can't achieve the same texture and flavor.  With charcoal, you're cooking hotter, and you're cooking with a lot more radiant heat.  Boom, Maillard reaction deliciousness.  You can't get that crisp on gas without overcooking it.  Some gas grills have cast-iron grates to absorb the heat and give you better searing, but it's not the same.\n\nCharcoal also gives you the flavor bonus of smoking, and it goes beyond the charcoal itself.  When you're cooking over charcoal, every drip of grease and fat or sauce that cooks out of your meat drips onto the charcoal and is vaporized, adding to the smoke.  That doesn't happen on gas, it just congeals in the bottom.\n\nI'd argue that a gas grill is better than a charcoal grill for most people, but a charcoal grill offers a superior end product if you know what you're doing and want to go through the hassle.\n\nResponse B Author: Bananafrosted\n\nResponse B: all of your points have nothing to do with the quality of the cooking of the food. its like \"propane is stored more easily\" its \"better for the environment\" or \"charcol is more of a pain in the ass\". none of your points touch on the subject of cooking food which is the main purpose of what we are talking about FIRSTLY. SECONDLY. people use charcoal for cooking because you are cooking with \"peripheral heat\", meaning, the charcoal gets hot, and cooks the food with the heat it gives off. (the smoke) this gives people the chance for smoking more easily. it controls the temperature much the same way a convection oven does. Flames under food will be more inconsistent because the temperature that you are reading is not the temperature that the food is being cooked at since the flame is usualy RIGHT under the meat or whatver. this overcooks food much more. it's like cooking food TOO fast and TOO hot a tall times.

CMV\n\nOp: Gender isn't a real thing. There are human beings with penises, and human beings with vaginas. The whole idea of boy/girl and man/woman is just a product of gender roles and stereotypes. You can't be a man (person with a penis) and \"feel\" like a woman simply because you like to shop and play with barbies and wear dresses.

A man needs to lose fat AND gait muscle to be found attractive. Even then, the body fat percentage that men need for their muscles to show is less than that of women. Take [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/FwZAX2Q.jpg) for example, everyone would agree that anything much below 15-17% in women is too thin, even at 30% women are hot. Take men now, personally I find 10-12% and 15% hot. Looking at the exercises men and women need to do, men would have to lift weights and eat more calories than they spend and gain fat and muscle (bulk), then eat fewer calories than they spend while still lifting to lose the fat without losing much of the muscle, and repeat. All a woman needs to do is do cardio and eat fewer calories than she spends and she'll lose weight. She can always lift weights too but that's optional.\n\n\nAlso, since I'm doing an edit, it is worth noting that women generally rate men as less attractive than men, source: http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-looks-and-online-dating/ .\n\n\n1.

Women store fat mainly in the breasts, hips, and butts and their bodies are made to try to have more fat reserves in order to support a pregnancy ([promoted by hormones](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090302115755.htm)).

Men, iirc, also deal with calorie reduction better than women.\n\nIt's easier for women to look good but easier for them to look bad as well, imo.\n\nA woman without makeup who wears it everyday normally will get a bunch of \"are you okay?\" and \"are you tired?\" messages. And in in SK, for instance, men use makeup in notable [numbers](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/lifestyle/2013/05/south-korean-men-cosmetics-crazed/). Men need to shave less (or hell, wax less), workout similarly or maybe a bit more, and dress well. The choices men have for dressing well are more constrained (women typically wear dresses, skirts, jeans, shorts, etc.) so it's easier for them to look good, imo. The rules aren't as cut and dry with women. Large breasts, small waist, small hips? Wear this, this, or this, or you'll look disproportionate and like a balloon. The same goes for other body types. Due to that fits are really fucked up for women's clothing. Men have less areas that vary and more clothes that are measured by the inch or cm.\n\nAnd if we're talking about anti-aging creams or something, nothing is stopping men from using \"women's\" products except lack of marketing (see: Bic razor's successful campaign to convince women shaving was important).Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author penguinluvinman's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

In the grand scheme of things, what are a few lives compared to the safety of thousands of others. The people they are torturing are a global threat; it's not out of patriotism that I'm trying to justify this for the sake of protecting good old 'murica. \n\nI think the main argument against me would be that there's a chance that some of these people may be innocent. But if someone came up to me, and said three other people and I need to be tortured because only one of us is a terrorist and it's either the four of us or potentially thousands of others, I would volunteer in a heartbeat. \n\nI am already well aware the government spends billions of dollars on military related things that the public has no idea about, and I'm okay with that because I understand that those are keeping us safe.\n\nI think my overall opinion is that it's good to be a good person and cooperate with people, but you also have to understand there are people who you can't negotiate with and you just have to kill (or torture) them.\n\nResponse A Author: cfuse\n\nResponse A: \nWhere does one set that line?\n\nI believe the phrase \"All men are created equal\" is a fairly central concept in America (or at least it's supposed to be). To bastardise Animal Farm: \"(are) some are more equal than others\"?\n\nWhat about American lives? Is it ok to torture people domestically? What's the difference between stopping foreign attacks and domestic threats?\n\nEssentially, who decides who gets tortured, and for what reasons?\n\n\nI don't believe that at all.\n\nIf you look at the bodycount from terrorism versus the bodycount from military action in response to terrorism, the numbers just don't stack up. If you look at the imposition on life and freedoms as a result of terrorism they really don't stack up.\n\nThere's also the issue that torture is probably an ineffective method of dealing with the broader issues. How does ripping people's fingernails off stop terrorism from fomenting in the first place? Torture is a reactive measure - in a best case scenario it is targeting events that are already in motion (which IMO is already far too late).\n\n\nI think the main argument against torture is that it is less effective than other measures.\n\nAdditionally, if we are to address ethical concerns, it isn't that you could be torturing 'innocent' people, it's that you are normalising brutalising people. Your standards for treating suspects drop considerably (to the point that you are prepared to kill them in the service of your goals). Once that happens that will permeate into broader society and what was once reserved for the 'enemy' will start to be used on citizens.\n\nPrinciples are important because they ensure that you don't go down a dark path to places where everyone will suffer. You become worse than what you are trying to eliminate.\n\n\nLet's have a little thought experiment: You are dragged in for 'questioning' and after you've been softened up a bit (ie. they beat you up, waterboard you, etc.) they bring in your wife, and child, and tell you that if you don't give up information they're going to rape them in front of you. You're innocent - you don't have any information to give. So they do rape them in front of you. Then they tell you that they're going to start cutting parts off them in front of you if you don't answer their questions. Again, you've got nothing to give them. So they start carving them up in front of you. Once it becomes obvious that there's no chance of any intelligence from you, they kill you all - because you are of no use to them anymore.\n\nReal torturers don't fuck around, they're experts in what they do - which is break people psychologically through any means at their disposal. \n\nIt's worth mentioning at this point that we only have a fraction of the evidence of the horrors that the US has put people through (and we'll probably never get to see any of it, because seeing minors degraded, raped, maimed, and then shot in the head isn't exactly a PR win for the US). If the US really stood behind what it has done there wouldn't be any issue with releasing all the information on 'interrogation' they have - but they know that what they've done is heinous and almost certainly war crimes, so we're never going to see that evidence.\n\n\nThat is the claim, but where is the evidence to support it?\n\n\nCan you be surprised when your enemies feel the same? \n\nNobody can negotiate fairly with the US - the US is a giant monster that does whatever the fuck it likes.

I agree with all of that. \n\nBut just for a thought experiment: What if torture did work?  And what if it was done transparently?  What if questions of \"Should we torture suspect A about case XYZ with method BCD?\" were put in a referendum and everyone voted on it?

Is there any reason for it to exist? \n\nIt seems like it would be simpler to have something like \"Day 48\" instead of \"February 17\". At the moment, the year is split up into twelve chunks, but they're not quite equal, their lengths appear to have no logical order aside from summing to 365 or 366, and one of them has a different length every 4 years. Whenever we refer to the frequency of an event as, say, \"once a month\", we could just as easily say that it's \"once every 30 days\".\n\n*Clarification: I'm saying that as it is, \"once a month\" is very imprecise anyway since months have varying lengths. For anything that can be this arbitrary, \"once every 30 days\" works just as well.*\n\nLeap years would also be extremely simple; instead of adding a day to a particular month, a day could just be added to a year.

Let's suppose I wanted to figure out what day of the week December 5th (Day 339) would be.\n\nTo figure it out in my head using the current months system, I would have to go through the following procedure (which could probably be reduced a bit, but not greatly):\n\n9/20 is a Saturday\n\n9/27 is a Saturday\n\n9/30 is a Tuesday\n\n10/7 is a Tuesday\n\n10/28 is a Tuesday\n\n10/31 is a Friday\n\n11/7 is a Friday\n\n11/28 is a Friday\n\n11/30 is a Saturday\n\n12/7 is a Saturday\n\n12/5 is a Friday\n\nOn the other hand, if I wanted to figure out the same thing using a \"numbered-day system\", it would be simple:\n\n(Day 339)-(Day 263)=(76 days)=6 days (mod 7).\n\nTherefore, Day 339 is 6 days later than a Saturday, so it's a Friday.\n\n\n**Consider this \"answered\", but if you disagree about the last point feel free to change my view on that too -- I'll still be reading comments.**\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: chewy628\n\nResponse A: If you're arguing for not using months because it makes it difficult to keep track of which day of the week it is, it would be much better to use the [International Fixed Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar).\n\nThis way, each day of the month is fixed to a certain day of the week. For example, the 15th (regardless of which month it is) will always be on a Sunday (or a Monday if the 1st starts on a Monday).\n\nThe calendar you propose requires math and would take longer, but the International Fixed Calendar only requires basic memorization.\n\nResponse B Author: doktordance\n\nResponse B: 13 months would make way more sense actually. If we had 13 months, each month would have exactly 4, seven day weeks with only 1.25 days left over at the end of the year (which could just be called new year's day and every 4 years leap day and not be an actual day of the week).\n\nThe only downside I can see is that birthdays and such would always fall on the same day of the week, so if you were born on a Wednesday, your birthday would always be on Wednesday and never on a weekend.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author chewy628's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: Take a look at these statistics from Wikipedia:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Taken from here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_safety)\n\nIt's unavoidable to conclude that riding a motorcycle is more dangerous than riding a car. It's intuitive based on how exposed motorcycle riders are.\n\nBut it's not even just the motor cycle rider's safety that is at risk. Cars are looking around them for other cars. It's easier to see other cars because 1) they are larger and 2) they are more common and what drivers expect.\n\nA last point, seat belts help protect members in both cars of a crash because loose bodies not belted in can bounce around and harm others in the car. Occasionally people end up getting thrown outside of the car if windows are open (I've seen this happen in person), and can even crash through closed windows, and could be a danger to other people in other vehicles. Motorcycles don't have seat belts of any sort, and once more both the loose body and loose motor cycle could be very dangerous to other members of the car crash.\n\nAgain, in the end it can be argued that it is the person's right to choose to ride a motorcycle, even if it is less safe, but that doesn't stop legislation that requires seatbelts. If safety can be mandated on the roadways, why doesn't it extend to motorcycles?\n\nAlright, that's all I got. CMV!\n\nResponse A Author: A_Mirror\n\nResponse A: I believe that the difference comes from the fact that you are simply requiring a passenger to reach up, grab their seatbelt, and securely fasten it to the holder, a process which takes about two seconds if you're particularly ham handed, and places no tangible burden on most anyone.\n\nBanning motorcycles would destroy an entire industry, bringing economic hardship and turmoil to many.  \n\nIt's a combination of \"It's safe\" and \"It doesn't place an undue burden on those affected by the law\".\n\nResponse B Author: qwertypolk\n\nResponse B: The primary purpose of a seatbelt in a car is to prevent people *in* the car flying around inside the car when there is a collision, bashing off other people in the car and causing serious secondary, indirect injuries. This situation almost never arises on a motorbike. People don't fly around inside a metal box, bashing off things, they fly into the air and (hopefully) roll. So a seatbelt on a vulnerable motorbike could actually be more dangerous, keeping a cyclist on a bike trapped under a burning car, than otherwise, allowing the (adequately protected) biker to fall from his or her bike and sustain lesser injuries.\n\nTL;DR Seatbelts in cars are for the safety of others, not the wearer.

Usually the term has to do with property, a nuisance is something which interferes with your enjoyment of your property.  We could apply the same term to your person however and basically be having the same conversation.\n\nNuisances are a pretty popular way to talk about law and economics.  It seems right that if a factory is producing pollution which blows onto your property and makes it so you can't comfortably go outside, that the factory should have to stop.  However, if we follow through on this sort of thinking, it can lead to large losses for the economy.  Say the factory produces a million dollars of value every month and the person is harmed by the pollution to the tune of a thousand dollars every month.  While we might emotionally side with the homeowner, the factory would be hurt more by stopping production than the homeowner is by production continuing.\n\nThe same reasoning can be applied to your cooking example.  Say the smell of my cooking causes you a small harm, like a dollar.  If some sort of device to prevent the smell getting out costs me a hundred dollars, it seems pretty unreasonable for you to force me to buy it.  The point is, what's harmful to someone is likely valuable to another, your proposal would actually end up causing more harm (reduction in value) than it prevented.\n\nResponse B Author: Rimfish\n\nResponse B: That title is pretty broad.

There are two main reasons:\n\n1) Streaming and subscription services have exploded at a staggering rate. Look at Spotify and Netflix as the prime examples. For an incredibly cheap price, or sometimes at no price at all, you can listen to almost any song your heart desires, or watch any movie that strikes your interest. Yes, it is true that both of these services do not have literally everything, but as the years go on, these services will only get better, to the point where it is virtually impossible to not have access to a movie or song.\n\n2) Storage devices will only continue to increase in storage capacity. Why own a disc that takes up physical space in your household when you can download all of your TV shows, movies, and music onto your computer? Many people today are creating their own home servers with tons of storage space to hold all their media. Granted, this is a bit difficult for those who are not tech savvy, but a few years from now, I'm positive that obtaining a server for your media and being able to place media on it will become an incredibly simple process.\n\nAs one final, less important point, physical media is restricted in its quality. What you purchase is what you get. For example, DVDs are not capable of playing movies in full HD. In order to get the best quality, you need to repurchase your DVDs in blu-ray. But even now, blu-rays are being outdone by 4k quality! How long will this continue for?\n\nI'd love to hear your opinions, because despite this, I do have an irrational attraction to physical CDs.\n\nResponse A Author: cdman\n\nResponse A: In addition to what others have said, almost always your rights are much more restricted when using streams (or other digital downloads for that case - like games, ebooks, etc). Usually they are considered **rented** instead of **bought** so you may not do a lot of things which people expect to do with their property. For example:\n\n* you (almost certainly) will be required to pay a monthly/subscription fee to continue to access the given video/music/etc which on the long term works out to a larger sum than if you would have just bought the individual items\n* if the business entity dissapears (goes bankrupt, is sold, etc) you will loose access to all the **rented** media\n  * ^ this already has happened to several games which require a central server to play\n* the provider may remove a given film/video/music/etc from their catalogue for any reason\n  * ^ again, this has happened to several games, music streaming services and ironically with the Amazon Kindle when they removed Orwell's 1984 from their customers devices\n* you are not allowed to backup \"your\" media from this services (to guard against the above failure cases) because legally you are only **renting** it\n* you are not allowed to re-sell your media (because you did not buy it legally)\n* you are not allowed to lend it to friends / relatives / etc\n* streaming services are almost always tied to your physical identity (compared to a cash-purchased physical item). This means that if somebody decides to harass people who have certain tastes (\"First they came for...\"), they can identify you\n\nThis is not to say that streaming services are all bad (they are great for sampling for example) but in my personal opinion a large majority of their user base misunderstands the nature of the service and what they get (and what they give up) when they pay for it.\n\nResponse B Author: caw81\n\nResponse B: Streaming and subscription services rely on unique DRM and remote authentication.  Once the unlocking services go away, so does your ability to access the media.\n\nThe DRM on physical media are well known and has been and will continue to be able to be accessible regardless of the future.

However, other medical illnesses aren't treated this way; if you go to the doctor for a routine check-up and your cholesterol is high, the doctor will attempt to intervene and the patient is expected to take the doctor's advice. The crux of my view is that I believe the same should be done for mood disorders. Please CMV.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: funchy\n\nResponse A: \nSeeking help for medical illnesses is also voluntary.  Nobody is required to go to a doctor for a medical condition. \nCholesterol screening is not mandatory.   A doctor will suggest having it checked and you can accept or decline. \n\nCholesterol screening is a simple blood diagnostic.  It's taken with other information such as age, health status, and symptoms to decide if the patient should try to lower cholesterol to lower their risk of cardiovascular problems.   \n\nDiagnosing depression isn't a diagnosis not a test.   Depression isn't a fixed mental state. Symptoms may come and go with stress or change in situation. To make an accurate assessment the patient needs to be seen by a mental health provider not the family doctor and a complete history needs to be taken.\n\nUsually when they talk about \"screening\"  it means the patient fills out a short 10 or 20 question survey,  points are added up for each answer, and a score suggests if the patient might need further follow up.   It relies on the patient giving honest answers and being self aware of their feelings. But as you know people who are seriously mentally ill may not be the best judge of themselves.\n\nThe thing is that the patient STILL must see a mental health professional to get a proper diagnosis.   If they're not ready to accept the possibility,  they're not going to do.  I don't believe the family doctor should try to play psychiatrist and try assorted psych meds; he doesn't have the training and the patient isn't getting therapist support.\n\nA better solution is to teach people the value of mental health services.   Get then them to trust mental health providers.   Make mental health care more accessible and more affordable.    Teach teens and young adults what is or isn't healthy behavior/thought and how to get help.   Address the lack of mental health services in some geographic areas.   Make sure minors and low income people always have some access to mental health services for free.\n\nResponse B Author: maskoficarus\n\nResponse B: If someone is depressed and also due for their checkup, you're now forcing them to be confronted about their problems in order to get other health care. Many depressed people will just stop scheduling checkups because, as you said, they have decided they don't want to seek help.\n\nThat said, once it's in your medical record that you have issues with depression, doctors will routinely ask you about your mental health.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author funchy's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

If a court of law decides that the case shouldn't go to trial, why should Roger Goodell suspend him for any extended amount of time? I agree that he should face some form of discipline, and two games seems a fair punishment (if not excessive). However, the media has chastised Goodell and the league for \"condoning domestic violence\" and not taking a stand. This seems unfair to all parties involved, in my opinion. So please Reddit, change my view.\n\n\nResponse A Author: gaviidae\n\nResponse A: The case didn't go to trial because Rice entered an intervention program which typically is done to remove criminal charges. It in no way says he is innocent and if anything implies he is guilty it's just a way to make the situation better without putting the spouse in jail. Rice also [apologized for his actions](http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/5/23/5744964/ray-rice-arrest-assault-statement-apology-ravens) which makes it pretty clear he behaved badly in some way. So it's completely false to imply the court considers him not guilty.\n\nAs for the NFL they have been coming down hard on other behaviors.  Ben Roethlisberger was initially suspended for 6 games for sexual harassment that he wasn't even formally charged with (Rice was not only charged but the charges were upgraded), Josh Gordon for an entire season for marijuana, and [A.J. Jefferson](http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2013/12/2/5167870/aj-jefferson-suspended-nfl-arrest) was suspended for 4 games for domestic assault. So a 2 game suspension seems pretty weak when compared to other suspensions and when Goodell is supposed to be getting tough on outside problems then it really seems weak.\n\nDomestic assault is a problem in the NFL. You have aggressive men with huge egos and there are going to be problems. It should be important for them to take the issue seriously. A two game suspension shows they do not [take it seriously](http://www.tmz.com/videos/0_c5nk3w3n) and deserves to be criticized by people who oppose domestic violence.\n\nResponse B Author: rap_mein\n\nResponse B: If the NFL were to take that sort of stance---saying that they would leave policing to the police and not meddle too much in the personal affairs of the players, then I would be inclined to agree with you. But that is clearly not the case; the NFL has not taken that stance.\n\nGoodell suspended Josh Gordon for one year for marijuana use, which like domestic violence, does not directly affect on-field performance in the way that steroids or something similar would. For that, Gordon was given a full-year suspension. For marijuana use...something that in [recent polls](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163835/tried-marijuana-little-changed-80s.aspx) almost 40% of the US population has admitted to (in actuality, the number is probably much higher). \n\nUnlike Ray Rice's attack on his then-fiancee, Josh Gordon's offense was victimless. The crimes that Ray Rice committed would result in real jail time for the average American, whereas Josh Gordon's \"crime\" wouldn't incur such harsh penalties. \n\nIf the NFL claimed to leave the policing to the authorities, a mere two-game suspension would be enough to make a statement. But given the NFL's policy of handing out pretty substantial suspensions for players who have committed what would in comparison be considered minor transgressions, the two game suspension isn't nearly enough. It sends a message that abusing a human being is less wrong than smoking a little pot. And domestic violence is a serious problem among NFL players that needs to be dealt with.\n\nIf the NFL is going to meddle in its players personal lives, it needs to be consistent with its punishments. The discrepancy between Gordon's and Rice's suspensions is notable and sends a message, intentionally or not.  \n\nIn recent years the NFL has suspended athletes who violate the NFL's substance abuse policies [a minimum of four games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_players_and_coaches_suspended_by_the_NFL#Suspensions_for_violating_the_substance_policies), but when a player viciously attacks another human being Roger Goodell feels a two-game suspension is sufficient. \n\nThe inconsistency that Goodell has shown sends a dangerous message to NFL players, one that could easily be withdrawn with a harsh penalty for Ray Rice's actions. But instead the NFL went easy on him with laughably modest disciplinary action. That's the way I see it.\n\n**TL;DR:** The inconsistency of Goodell's suspensions sends a dangerous message to players and for that reason, the NFL should have taken stricted action against Ray Rice.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author gaviidae's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I am intentionally not stating my own beliefs as it's not relevant (EDIT: actually it's pretty obvious!)\n\nIf you are religious, the chances are high that your religion only allows believers into heaven/paradise after our earthly lives end. Some may go even further and state that if you don't believe, not only will you not go to heaven, you will end up in hell. People who follow these religions have a moral duty to do all they can to help people get into heaven/avoid hell.

And as for hell,  no-one- not even Hitler- deserves an ETERNITY of torture. \n\nI admit that religious people who do not believe in hell or heaven have no moral obligation to try and convert people.\n\nAtheists generally believe that their worldview leads to greater human happiness. A rough spectrum of examples of religion decreasing human happiness (from significantly decreasing to only a little): ISIS, Hamas v Isreal, sick children being prevented treatment due to religious parents, parents disowning a child for coming out as gay, spending Sunday at church instead of doing something more fun. Atheists therefore have a moral obligation to spread their viewpoint in order to make the world a better place. Atheists who insist on never trying to convert a religious person are doing the world a disservice- what if the person you didn't want to convert goes on to drive their own child to suicide because they said 'god doesnt make mistakes' regarding their child's transexuality?\n\nOf course there are atheists who do NOT believe that atheism leads to greater human happiness. Again, I admit that these people have no moral obligation to convert people (from their point of view).\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: FaerieStories\n\nResponse A: Essentially your argument is that our moral obligations stem entirely from our individual beliefs. Assuming you do not believe in hell (though maybe you do, I don't know) you are claiming that even though you don't believe this place exists, you think that someone who genuinely *does* believe such a place exists has the moral obligation to prevent people from being sent there - even though you would say that they are mistaken that there is such a place.\n\nSo my response to that is this: if someone *genuinely believed* that a deity had told them to kill another person (or multiple people) in order for both they and he to achieve salvation, would you argue that it is moral for them to do so? If your answer to that question is 'no', then doesn't this contradict your argument that people should act solely based on their own beliefs about what is or isn't right?\n\nResponse B Author: Nikcara\n\nResponse B: It is also possible to believe in an afterlife where you are judged solely by how good of a person you are and NOT your beliefs.  I can go more in depth if you want, but I believe that your religion or lack thereof doesn't make a bit of difference in how you're judged at the end of your life.

I've worked in a non-partisan role in provincial politics for 25 years and have come to know personally countless politicians. I've been struck time and time again by how incredibly hard they work. They typically work 14 hour days, at least six days a week. Marriages are destroyed by the demands of a job that leaves too little time for their families. They all belong to multiple committees, which means countless meetings and reading and consulting and report writing. They attend endless other meetings and barbecues and graduation ceremonies and band concerts and speaking engagements and weddings, etc.,  ad nauseum, often bouncing from one event to another and another and another in a single day, all in an effort to be present and accountable to their constituents. \n\nAn inner-city MLA I know specifically chose his constituency office in a location that would help street people by providing them with clean bathrooms, a reading room with a telephone and computer and fresh water, and by staffing it so it was open every day from 7 am to 8 pm. He and his office staff are more like outreach workers. \n\nI travelled with several committees that held hearings throughout the province on assorted topics, I've seen these people come into the process with one position, change their minds as a result if what they heard, and successfully lobby their own caucuses to change. Committee members come from all parties, but they get along with one another and have active debates that challenge preconceived positions.\n\nThe men and women I met almost always started in local politics, serving on school boards and library boards and volunteering for local causes, all because they actually give a shit and want to make a difference in their communities. \n\nThey're actually real people, just like you, except they're willing to work hard for their communities -- when they could be sitting at home with their feet up, watching Survivor and bitching about politicians. \n\nIt's hard work. It's also thankless, because after years of work making improvements in their own communities, they manage to get elected and are instantly perceived as dirty, grubbing, asshole politicians. And it doesn't matter how hard they work, because a sizable number of people are going to hate them simply because they're politicians and are therefore contemptible. \n\nI wouldn't do it, but I'm really thankful that there are still a dwindling number of idealists out there who will -- at least for a few years, until they exhaust themselves and finally throw in the towel, beaten down by people who hate them for trying to make a difference. \n\nAnd yes, there are corrupt politicians, but they're the exception. Most bust their ass in a thankless job that burns them -- and their families -- out. \n\n\n\n\nResponse B Author: schnuffs\n\nResponse B: I just need to point something out. When you say that no party represents Canadian values, then go on to say that parties only care for the poor and vulnerable as much as it supports them, that means that the amount of support they give is only as much as Canadian values would dictate. That's why we have elections, to elect parties which most represent out collective values.\n\nBut something else to consider is that choosing a party which wholly represents your values and views is a losing battle. What you have to do is personally take stock of what values you have, prioritize them and find out which are the most important to you, and then vote for the party which *best* represents those views, not one that *totally* represents *all* your views. If you think that the environment is the most important issue, vote for the Green Party. If it's social justice and welfare, vote NDP. etc. \n\nThe key to democracy is compromise, but that compromise doesn't just happen between the politicians and the political parties, you have to compromise with yourself on what's most important to you. You have to realize that virtually no one will hold your personal views completely, but that there are parties that will hold your most important views more highly than the others.

They always require some kind of special slot or pouch, refusing to properly fit into ~~traditional~~ pouchless wallets.\n\nOn the other hand, flat notes are lightweight, cheap to manufacture, and space-efficient. Yes, they are more perishable (especially US bills), but that either makes the case for more durable notes or they are sufficiently durable; they already represent the highest denominations of cash anyway.\n\nCollectors can be satiated by printing special edition notes instead of special edition coins.\n\nIs there a good reason to keep coins?\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: thencaapawardgoesto\n\nResponse A: I don't really share you concerns about coins. Then again, Canada loves coins so much we've got 1$ and 2$ coins.\n\nI also have the advantage of being a woman. They don't make wallets without change purses for women. It's just not done.\n\nCoins are sturdier. They require replacement less. They're the economical choice. \n\nThey're also easier to use in automated machines. Bills get crumpled and ripped and you end up trying to put them into the machine 7 different ways before they accept it. A coin just thunks through by weight measurement. They're simple to use.\n\nResponse B Author: Hayleyk\n\nResponse B: The problem isn't coins.  Coins can be very, very handy.  They problem is outdated denominations.  Pennies are not a meaningful sum any more, and nickels are not much better.  In Canada, it felt like all the change we have was a nightmare until we got rid of the penny.  When there are only larger denomination coins to deal with, they aren't inconvenient at all.  The smallest number of coins that can add up to one bill here is only 3.  Only 3 coins is equal to a $5 bill, which isn't really that many, and not so many that you would need a coin purse to keep track of them.  I rarely have more than 8 coins on me at any given time, and I do have a coin pouch (girl wallet).  Compared to in the US where you would need 20 quarters, which is maybe hard for you to conceptualize if you haven't lived with $1 and $2 coins for a long time like I have.\n\nAlso, coins are actually smaller than bills, and they work much better in vending machines/parking meters/etc.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author thencaapawardgoesto's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I am an engineering major but I've always thought that the study of art history, literature, drama, and many other subjects is critical to understanding ourselves as humans. So I just want to set the record straight that I do value the humanities. However, my current view is that it is the prerogative of publicly funded institutions to serve the well-being of our society by creating jobs and providing a return on investment for those who pay tuition. Statistically(in terms of average starting salary) return on investment seems to be highest in the areas of science, engineering, and business. So, in a world where 46.5M american citizens are below the government poverty line, I don't see the justification for funding an art history program over the expansion of a chemistry program(to provide an example). I guess I wonder if the study of such things would be best left funded by private institutions or in cases where a case could be made that humanities research could create jobs.\n\nAny thoughts? I'd love to hear the opposing argument.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: bmangan\n\nResponse A: First I believe you have a flawed view of the purpose of federal funding. You seem to believe that federal funding is a monetary investment which is expected to be returned in a monetary gain. That's not why governments exist in capitalist societies though. The idea behind a capitalist economy is that the market will fulfill the vast majority of peoples wants and needs because people will be willing to pat for them. \n\nThe problem with the humanities, and therefore the need for federal funding, is that people don't like paying or art and because of that artists don't become artists because of the investment required and the poor return on investment. Therefore the government steps in to fill a need that the market isn't filling. The government shouldn't revoke funding because of the lack of money making potential in the humanities. If we both agree that the humanities are something that is universally beneficial to the nation, the government needs to fill the holes in the market. \n\nResponse B Author: jcooli09\n\nResponse B: Money is not, or at least should not be the most important thing in the world.  The humanities are neccessary to continue to advance, and in my opinion vital to the survival of the species.  We need to promote wisdom allong technology.\n\nAs you point out, the humanities donot really provide much in the way of roi.

CMV\n\nOp: Let me start by saying that I think a social safety net is a beautiful and noble idea. If it were used properly, it would assist people who have fallen on hard times until they can get back on their feet. Unfortunately, in the US, that idea doesn't seem to be working very well.\n\nI believe that government support simply creates a culture of laziness and a mentality of entitlement. I believe it makes people weaker and is just another tool used by those in power to control and suppress the stupid masses. When someone has to fend for themselves, they become stronger. When someone else feeds them, they lose the ability to feed themselves. But people do enjoy handouts (everyone does, even the wealthiest) and by throwing them a bite, it's easy to get their votes. It makes people complacent and less likely to push themselves to learn new skills and persevere.\n\n***I know anecdotal evidence isn't proof of anything, but neither are statistics so don't get on that \"anecdotal evidence train\" because it's still evidence.***\n\nI know an immigrant who came here and started working at a pizza place. He had no real skills, but he knew he wasn't going to get  government assistance so he got himself a job and did it well. Later he started doing tile and flooring work with no previous experience. He worked hard because he knew there was no safety net for him. He supported a family of three with an income of 28K and now they live better than some Americans who earn twice that. Why? Because his family has their priorities straight and knows how to manage money. I believe that is because they know that there is no one to take care of them.\n\nI also have a friend who owns a small business. She offers health insurance, retirement account benefits, and even tuition assistance for her employees. Very few take those offers, especially the last one. I would argue that the last one is the one most likely to help them get a better job, but people are lazy because of the entitlement culture here in the US. They truly believe that they deserve something for nothing. They think the world owes them something. I believe that this mentality is caused by welfare programs.\n\nOn a somewhat different note, I also believe that corporate welfare is just as terrible, if not worse. It props up businesses that should fail. It allows major corporations to make destructive decisions that can harm the whole economy. If any welfare were the end, this should be the first to go.\n\n\nResponse A Author: bantership\n\nResponse A: Statistics are actually used to prove things all the time. Without statistics, there is no proof of the Higgs boson. Without statistics, there is no 'average American income.' We would have no tax brackets because we wouldn't know where to put them.\n\n\nStatistics prove things better than anecdotes can, but I still like both.\n\nAnecdote: J.K. Rowling was on public welfare and survived in large part due to food stamps before she wrote Harry Potter. So was Barack Obama's mother.\n\nStatistics: 80% of people get off of welfare within 5 years. The vast majority of people on welfare want more than to be dependent on the government all their lives. \n\nSource: http://www.city-data.com/forum/politics-other-controversies/1849761-welfare-us-just-facts.html\n\nPeople on Social Security Disability would often die an early and tragic death without their benefits. We are not a country that kills our sick and weak. We are a country that values life.\n\n\nResponse B Author: DemonicBtch\n\nResponse B: Have you ever been on welfare?  For most programs, there is a requirement that you seek employment.  You can only receive food stamps for about 2 years without taking a class where you fill out applications with businesses that have agreed to hire from the program.  TANF can only be collected for 2 years, period, and you basically have to volunteer during that time, employed by the government with few enough hours that you can seek other employment.  Few people qualify for Medicaid in the first place--this will be changing in some states soon--and still requires cash out of pocket to receive treatment if you're not a child.

Scientific theories are not discoveries. There is no way of 100% confirming whether a theory is true or false. Only ways of confirming it. For example the Law of conservation of mass-energy can be verified so many times, but it cannot be proven as true for all cases.  \nAlso there are [cases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_patent#Australia) where naturally occuring DNA sequences have been patented.  \nI feel that when Apple can patent something as trivial as curved edges for their phone, Scientists should be allowed to patent and get royalties for thinking the way no one has never thought before.  \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: super_pinguino\n\nResponse A: The goal of scientific research is the advancement of human knowledge. The patenting of ideas or theories would be completely counter to what academia is trying to do. The free flow of ideas is extremely important to scientific advancement. Imagine if I made some groundbreaking theory and patented it. Every person who wanted to use this theory in their research would have to may some royalty to me. While this is a pretty good situation for me, imagine how many fewer people there would be pursuing these projects than if everything were freely available. More so, such a system would change how people decided upon project/research ideas. \"Safer\" ideas and \"cheaper\" ideas would get more interest than the more complex ones. Scientific research is all about creativity. A system like this, whether possible or not, would stifle all scientific advancement from that point out.\n\nResponse B Author: baby_butt_fuck\n\nResponse B: What exactly do you think would be the outcome of patenting a scientific theory?  No object is allowed to fall unless it pays a commission to Newton and Einstein?  Nobody is allowed to know about gravity unless they pay for the knowledge?  Nobody can account for gravity in their designs unless they pay a fee?  \n\nIf you're saying that scientific discoveries should be correctly attributed, then yeah.

But in light of events like officers pointing guns at peaceful protestors or at media, I have been overcome with rage everytime I see cops get away with behaviour like this. Even worse when I came to the realization that these sort of thing probably happens every day, and it isn't until today's era that we can finally have proof thanks to cameras being everywhere. Now, I understand the power of doxing and how it puts not only the subject in danger but their family aswell, I believe it is the best kind of \"ultimatum\" to get these cops to admit their wrongs and be judged fairly by the law. This question was triggered by the specific case of [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2e3ifo/ferguson_cop_points_assault_rifle_at_protestors/). Upon further investigation of that case, I found out that he was removed of his duty after the incident.

They end up living in horrific conditions, usually don't get a good education and end up perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Along with poverty comes other social ills, including crime. \n\nThere are already way too many people in this world. \n\nI submit that every single female child should get an implant before puberty (until they can find one for males, in which case all males should get one too). The implant would be removed when the person could provide proof of their ability to support a child/ren. We are required to provide proof of our ability to pay for pretty much everything these days (if we want to get a loan etc) so why not have to provide proof that you are able to support a child.\n\nOf course I know that life happens and that things are not always hunky dory. People lose jobs/have accidents etc etc and sometimes end up poor even after a pretty good beginning BUT it is a fact that MOST people will end up in the same income bracket as their parents therefore why don't we legislate for more stable families?\n\nOnce you have had your child, you would be re-implanted with the birth control until you can prove again that you can afford a next child. \n\n\nJust as an aside, the reason I started this CMV is because of something someone posted on FB earlier. http://imgur.com/a/1WTnB This family is living the poorest of poor lives and needing construction material to make their shack bigger.

Possibly a tax benefit for people who don't have children until they are 25, perhaps offering help with education costs as well so families have a better chance of being able to support their children later on.\n\nAlso, if we make any rule to this effect, it should apply to everyone equally, male or female, regardless of social or economic class and not be aimed solely at the poor.

I think that's the gray area, because who are we to say whether or not a family is able to raise a good child? Just because someone is poor, doesn't mean they won't make great parents. Just because someone was once a drug addict, doesn't mean that they turned their lives around and are ready to nurture a human being, and keep them off the track that they took on their life.\n\n I think it is the humanitarians that would have a problem with the idea. What makes it so the government can approve or disapprove a family of a child? In a country of democracy, that would not go over well with citizens.

This is what is referred to as the \"Herd Immunity.\" If you are not vaccinated, but you never come into contact with someone else who is not vaccinated, then you are given a sort of protection by eliminating your own exposure. **Those who have a religious or ideological opposition to vaccination are therefore partially protected, despite their own opposition to the practice,** and should not be permitted this protection by being present in a society that has taken the effort to vaccinate them.\n\nThe only excuse I am ready to accept without argument is a medical excuse for vaccination: If a vaccination will cause injury to an individual due to allergies or immune deficiency, then they should be exempt.\n\nChange my View.\n\n\n\n**\u2206 and Clarifications**: The specific vaccines I feel should be \"compulsory\" are those that are approved by a panel of experts on the subjects (from Immunology, epidemiology, virology, microbiology, etc), but I expect these would include childhood vaccines TDaP, MMR, Hep B, MCV4, IPV, Varicella, and before long the HPV vaccine.

Parents who wish to homeschool their children must complete an education course on vaccination and pass an exam on how vaccines work, or have their children vaccinated.\n3.

Both men and women use the stalls and I see no problem if the stall next to it is used by someone of a different gender. \n\nAs for the urinals, I think with partitioning walls between the urinals, that prevent any accidental side glances onto anyones exposed genitalia, there is no reason why a woman shouldn't see the fully clothed back of a man while he's peeing. \n\nNot dividing bathrooms would be slightly more practical in regards to room and plumbing and it would benefit transgender people. Also it might help us all to get less weird about the opposite gender and their bodily functions, if we shared a bathroom. Although my main point is not, that the non-dividing would be tremendously useful, I just think there really is no good reason to divide bathrooms by gender. \n\nAlright, I'm ready to have my view changed! \n\n\n\n1. I come from a pretty privileged point of view when it comes to sexual harassment of any kind. This leads me to believe that a neutral bathroom would be fine. Apparently the experience of people (mainly women) in other parts of the world is vastly different, so it probably wouldn't be fine there. \n\n2. US bathroom stalls are parted by very small walls, while bathroom stalls where I live are often parted by full size walls reaching to the ceiling and floor, so any kind of peeping over the stall wall would be much less of a problem around here. \n\n3. I need to work on my use of sex and gender. In my language they are both the same word, we don't have that difference, so I mess them up a lot. I will work on that. \n\n4. People are surprisingly passionate about who they share a bathroom with. \n\n5. People are irrationally afraid of hearing women poop. Get a grip, women have bowel movements too! People are also irrationally afraid of someone hearing them poop. Get over it, everybody shits.\n\nSo, view changed? Kind of. I recognize that my experience is not universal and that it would be a much bigger problem in other places. I still think that unisex bathrooms would work fine around here and I heard many examples where they do work fine.

In my country we still struggle with a rape culture and male privilege.   Women are still too fearful to share a bathroom with men and trust they won't make threatening comments or actions.   \n\n\n\nSex and gender can mean the same thing,  as in male versus female.  In the right context you could use the words interchangeably.\n\nBut sex has many meanings. \n\n\nPeople are passionate about who they expose their most vulnerable activities with in general.   Using a bathroom can make someone feel very exposed. \n\n\n\nIn my area of the us, we're starting to see a 3rd type of bathroom in busy locations.   Not only is there women's women's and men's but there's a single stall private room.  Sometimes it's labeled \"family\" and sometimes it simply has symbols of man/woman/wheelchair.   It's used by families (mom can bring stroller in and change baby).  They're typically very large so it may work for handicapped.   anyone who wants it can use, for example transgendered.  \n\nPeople seek privacy when they attend to bodily functions.   After all, if they didn't, there wouldn't be doors or stalls in any bathroom.   Surely you can agree you'd prefer to have a door you can close when you're pooping?\n\nHow much privacy is simply a function of the culture and traditions of an area.   You may not understand why things are done a particular way, but you do need to respect it's their way.

You say that you think we shouldn't have different public bathrooms for different *genders*, yet you refer to different *sexes* in your next sentence. So which is it? Genders or sexes?\n\nI'll assume you're talking about sexes just so I can proceed with my post. That said, there are actually quite a few problems with this: sexual harassment, promiscuity, voyeurism, general creepiness... I could go on but I think that's enough.\n\n\nYou're assuming that this will be the case with every man and woman at every instance of entering a bathroom. Have you ever considered that women may not be comfortable with looking at a man peeing even if he is fully-clothed from the back? And have you ever considered that the bathroom may be more than just a place to piss and shit for women? Women go to the bathroom to socialize, in packs. It's a safe zone, a completely anti-male place. Removing that will make women feel unsafe. \n\n\nWait, what? How? If you're trying to provide the space for the same population of people, logic dictates that it would be the same amount of space. How that space is divided doesn't exactly matter. And I don't even know how it would be beneficial in regards to plumbing. I'm not a plumber, and I don't know how any of the water systems in a bathroom function so I'm not going to comment on that, but I fail to see how making a bathroom open to both sexes would make the plumbing more efficient. \n\n\nAgain: why and how? First of all, you're still being vague with your argument, using the term \"gender\" to stand in for \"sex\", so I'm not even sure what your argument is anymore. And secondly, how? You can't just say \"it'll benefit them\" as a point.\n\n\nI don't understand this point. I'm going to stop mentioning that you keep using genders to refer to sexes because at this point, I don't even think you understand your own argument. First of all, I think as adults, we're all aware of one another's \"bodily functions\". Some people talk about them, some don't. I know that my girlfriend and I are completely open about this kind of thing while other people would rather hang themselves than talk about their bathroom life. Second of all, getting \"less weird\" isn't something that would be beneficial for some people. It's not weird to not want to talk about stuff that grosses you out. I personally don't give a shit (no pun intended), but I know people who have to leave the room when there's talk of blood or poop because they're really weak in that sense. \n\n\nThere are many good reasons to keep bathrooms the way they are right now (see my list above). It's the best system of separation which guarantees the best protection for both sexes, socially and physically. \n\n**TL;DR:** You make broad generalizations, don't understand your own argument, and have no concrete facts to back your claims. The best I can do is just tell you you're wrong. However, if you'd like to put forth a better argument for your view, I'd be happy to try again with a more organic process.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author funchy's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

The number of single parent households would drop because the baby would not have been born until both parents sign the birth certificate. Until the baby has been born, the birth certificate filed, it would not be a citizen.\n\nCases of misattributed paternity could be eliminated by requiring a paternity test before the father could sign the birth certificate. Prenatal genetic testing can identify paternity as an incidental finding. Birth certificates would identify the parents of the child and not the people intending to raise it so anonymous sperm and egg donation would be illegal.\n\nPrenatal paternity testing would allow for provisional filing of the legal birth certificate before the baby has been physically born.\n\nBabies that have been physically born but not legally born would be in a legal state similar to cohabiting couples who are not married.\n\n\nResponse A Author: A_Soporific\n\nResponse A: This is *way* bigger a proposal than just changing the legal definition of birth. You're suggesting that we change the very nature of US Citizenship, eliminate the responsibility men have to women when it comes to sex and family, and create the possibility for there to be non-persons.\n\nLook, I can guarantee you that some people will be born off grid and might not get a birth certificate registered or the birth certificate could be lost/damaged/misfiled. What then? You say that it's like cohabitating couples who are not married, but *that's not a legal thing* there are no laws about cohabitating couples nor are there any rights or privileges. You're saying that we *legally ignore these people*. Which means that they fall in the legal category of \"resident aliens\" not \"citizen\". How is that a good thing? How is that a desirable thing? All the rights and privileges of Americans are tied to citizenship or defined by treaty, *none of those apply*. How could you possibly be so flippant about things that protect the rest of us from torture and give us the ability to have a say in the political process?\n\nMisattributed paternity isn't an especially big problem, certainly not one big enough to warrant fundamentally changing the way we do thing to one which apparently *assumes* infidelity and misattributed paternity. You're wasting 90% of the population's time because nothing occurred to created the situation, and of the 10% not all would care about misattributed paternity. Please don't change the rules for everyone because you have trust issues.\n\nAs far as the father opting out, that brings up a huge problem. What is to stop him from telling her before and during pregnancy that he's in only to not sign the certificate. The child exist. A living human being is there. Are you suggesting that if the mother was depending upon the father for support and the father abdicates, then we're just going to kill the infant to cut down on single parent households? I mean, what was the implication I was supposed to get from that statement? You can't shove the kid back in or abort after birth to get to that \"reduced number of single parent households\". The only other option is we bring back massive, state-run orphanages for kids that aren't even classed as human beings. \n\nAny \"moment of truth\" that decides the life of the infant in question need to occur before physical birth.\n\nResponse B Author: Lluxx\n\nResponse B: How would this new legislation benefit the government (particularly) or the general population?\n\n\nThere would be a public outcry at that. Most laws are pretty much designed to prevent or reduce human suffering where possible. As babies can suffer, I can't see many people considering it morally acceptable to kill them. Plus, if it's no longer murder, how does this relate to other laws regarding treatment of fellow humans? Can babies be tortured before their birth certificates are signed? Raped? Scarred or mutilated? \n\nTo legalise such a thing would pretty much go against the entire reason we have laws. Abortion is already legal in plenty of places (and can be campaigned for if it's not); if someone does not want a baby, they can have an abortion. If they birth the child and still don't want it, they can give it up for adoption. With these laws in place, it's unecessary to kill off unwanted babies and thus nobody would support it or support a government that wanted it. \n\n\nI'm aware that child support laws are debated at the moment, but I'm not going to get into that right now apart from to say this situation would benefit nobody except the few fathers who don't want to be fathers. Let's imagine that suddenly a lot of men have a way to not support their children (or vice versa, assuming the mother is also allowed to give up her parental rights in the same way). This then means there's a lot of single mothers who need more help to raise children. Where are they going to get that help from? The government, because I can't see developed countries shrugging and saying that children and mothers need to starve on the streets. That means more taxpayer money to support one-parent children. Therefore this is harmful both to the government and the population. \n\nOr, to go even further, say that the father agrees to pay child support throughout the pregnancy, but when the baby is born he goes back on this agreement. Let's assume the mother is also allowed to refuse to sign the birth certificate and now does so because she doesn't want to be burdened with a child with only her to support it. What happens to be baby now? We've already discussed that post-birth abortions aren't going to happen, so we just have even more children using the taxpayers' money, which - once again - is beneficial to nobody but a very slim minority of parents. \n\n\n\nFor most people, there's no need to require anything, so this would just be needless paperwork that would get in the majority's way, not to mention - once again - expensive to fund. In cases where a paternity test is desired, the parents can already get one without needing all this extra legislation. \n\nFurthermore, how would this even work? Would there be a time frame to sign the certificate? Could parents keep the kid but kill it off if they got bored after a few years? Could a forgetful parent accidently prevent their kid from becoming a citizen? The whole thing just seems ridiculously impractical to me. \n\nEssentially, this proposal would be very expensive to fund (laws aren't simple and take a lot of work), is actively harmful to humans and thus immoral, would provide slim-to-no benefits for the majority of people, whilst making them pay for it, and is generally unnecessary considering that abortions are already a thing, as are adoptions.

I'm sure this won't be a popular post, because anytime I see any sort of numbers or facts on the issue thrown around, they get buried. However, I really want to discuss this, and listen to other sides of the story. I do not want racist thoughts, and I do not want to feel like I hate a majority based on their skin color. That being said, black people are, allegedly, more violent. It makes them scary, and regardless of color, I would avoid violent individuals at all costs. Moot point, one that a bunch of you may find comical: one of my best friends is black. I love him more than any other person on this planet. I understand that what I am about to post does not apply to ALL black people -- but I do feel like it is a huge majority.\n\nThis is the image that started all of this for me: [2010 National Crime Victimization Survey Infographic](http://i.imgur.com/haSEQTV.jpg)\n\nThat absolutely blew my mind. I felt validated -- that everything I had thought up to that point about the violence permeating black culture was true. The numbers don't lie, do they?\n\n**Point**: Poverty. Poverty breeds violence, and it can be seen in nations all across the world. As an anecdotal addition to my post -- for the first 16 years of my life I was in the lowest bracket of poverty imaginable. I realize this is not true for a lot of people, but I have not, nor will I ever be a violent person. Poverty did not make me violent, and many peers of mine who were in the same situation as children, or even as adults, are not violent whatsoever. I do not think that poverty is an excuse for violence. I do not think that there is ANY excuse for violence, even with institutionalized racism and poverty abound. Especially as young adults or adults, we are responsible for our own actions, and no amount of excusing it makes up for the numbers in the infographic. None. It's sickening, regardless of color.\n\nI cannot think of ANY situation where violence is acceptable other than self-defense. That is part of the reason why I don't understand the other side of the argument -- it is never acceptable, and there is *literally* no excuse for it. \n\nWhy, then, is it so common for black people to commit heinous crimes when they represent a very SMALL portion of the United States?\n\n**Point**: Slavery and discrimination. Every race on the face of the planet has been enslaved at one point or another. Every PERSON on this planet has been discriminated against one way or another.

CMV\n\nOp: This is a quandary of logic that I discovered a while back. Put simply the idea is put forward that any religion that calls for the sharing with and converting of others not in your religion means that your deity unfairly punishes certain people. While this is primarily targeted at Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, it can apply to any religion where humans are judged and then receive an eternal reward/punishment. When you have a religion that calls for a \u201cspreading of the gospel\u201d, to use the Christian term, you have a deity that has whether or not you're a member of his church in his list of qualifications for getting your eternal reward. Most religions explain that it is necessary (or even mandatory) for receiving the reward. \n\nThis is when I would ask what about people that never knew your religion? My usual example is people that lived in either Ancient Egypt, Greece, or other prehistoric societies, or native populations that live far remote from your church. Most explain these as either \u201cThey get a free pass\u201d or \u201cThey never knew *My Deity*, so they receive eternal punishment.\u201d \n\nThis leads me to say this: Either you have a deity that is willing to punish whole civilizations that never got a chance to view \u201cthe truth\u201d, or one that let's anyone in who never had to make a choice. If it's the first, why would you want to worship someone like that? If it is the latter, why tell anyone if ignorance is a free pass?\n\nTL;DR: Either you have a massively unfair deity, or one that you wouldn't want to share the religion about. CMV\n\n\nResponse A Author: piyochama\n\nResponse A: Why would you believe these are the only two options? \n\nA completely scriptural view is that purgatorial weak universalism is the actual means with which God chooses to save the world, for example, in Christianity. Or that, in Buddhism, you'll literally reroll until you get the facts straight. In Islam, when the second coming rolls around, everyone gets a second chance, face to face with God, to recant their sins and believe.\n\nAlso, you misunderstand religion. Religion isn't about the end goal \u2013 not for any of the mainstream religions. All the mainstream ones are purely about both orthopraxy, or how to live a good life, and orthodoxy, or what to believe. \n\nResponse B Author: Quidagismedici\n\nResponse B: If there is one God who was the author of all creation (including right &amp; wrong) &amp; who decides to save or condemn, who is a human to judge the criteria by which that decision is made? Sure it may seem unfair to me, it may seem unfair to you, but why should God be bound by our sense of fairness? Why should God save any of us at all? &amp; how is it any more arbitrary to pick the saved based on their attitude to him than it is to pick them by how they treated their own, or what colour hair they had or whether they had children or not, or whether they ate meat?\n\nIf such a God exists then the criteria for salvation he picks are the criteria, there'd be no point in deciding they were unfair &amp; condemning others by choosing not to give them the opportunity to meet them. You'd hardly call it fair to put your own moral vanity ahead of other people's souls; I don't think it's fair that ships sometimes sink, but that doesn't mean I'd be justified in refusing to hand out life-jackets if I was present at a ship-wreck &amp; happened to have some. In the kind of world-view we're talking about, damnation &amp; salvation are just simply facts, exactly the same as any other danger.\n\nNow, I may be reading too much into what your saying in this next paragraph, so ignore this if I am, but I'm getting the impression that you're saying that the realisation that the god one believes in is unfair should be reason for doubt. That would be a complete nonsequitur since whether or not something is fair does not have any impact on whether or not it's real, so to leave one's religion because one thinks damnation is wrong would be as pointless as giving up a healthy lifestyle because one believes sickness is wrong.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author piyochama's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

This issue has been discussed by philosophers for hundreds of years. One political philosopher who tackled this issue is Thomas Hobbes, who wrote 'Leviathan.'

That's the natural state according to Hobbes. *But* we can escape that through society.

CMV.\n\nOp: To me it seems that the rule of law functions through coercion based on threat of violence. \n\nThe way I see it if you don't play by their (governments') rules they will take away your things (via fines) or commit violence against you in the form of forced internment (prison). I'm not saying that this is good or bad, most of the rules are pretty reasonable. It's just that the system looks inherently violent to me. \n\n(I have a very minimal polysci background so please ELI5 any jargon that I might not know. It will lead to better discussion if I don't have to ask for clarification)\n\n\nWhen I said I do not view this as either good nor bad it was a lie meant to direct discussion toward alternate ways of seeing this as opposed to the ethical side if things. \n\nI'm at work now so I'll respond to all tonight. \n\nResponse A Author: telegraphist\n\nResponse A: Ah, yes and no.  The ability to do violence and the monopoly on violence, the ability to kill civilians, to create law and grant exception from it, can all be seen as violence and all contribute to the \"rule of law.\"\n\nHowever, once the legitimacy of law has been established through this violence/threat of violence and sovereignty of the state exists, law takes on a different form of reproduction.  Beyond any threat of violence or actual implementation of the law, the law's legitimacy is internalized by citizens, it takes on a hyper-real legitimacy separated from any real threat of violence.  Citizens interpolate the normative values produced and supported by laws, laws become enforced through social isolation and stigmatization, people truly believe that the law is there to help them, to keep them safe.\n\nA metaphor for this can be money, initially money was backed by some standard (ie gold), but now paper money has value as a result of people having faith that it will continue to hold value for trade and whatnot.  Though money can be exchanged for its value in gold, its value also exists separate of gold.  The legitimacy and rule of law continues to exist somewhat separate of enforcement, through the internalization of law as \"good,\" and the training of people to obey laws.\n\nNow, here is where this metaphor can show us something even more interesting.  The gold standard which gave money \"real\" value beyond faith only holds value because people hold faith that gold will continue to be valued, therefore they will use it for trade.  So how does this compare to the rule of law?\n\nLaw exists as social control beyond the act of its enforcement, or its threat of enforcement, because people believe in it.  One can argue it is because the believe punishment will follow regardless of if it will or not, but I am unconvinced on this point.  People believe law is good and therefore they follow it.  Now, if gold is only considered the \"real\" value behind money (initially) because of belief in its value, the parallel argument in the sense of law is that even when the government forces its law on people through violence, it can still only exist as law as long as people believe in its legitimacy.  Now, this legitimacy can be produced by violence, but still the rule of law is contingent on the internalization of the law by people.  If people did not internalize the law, believe it to be good (or at least that it must be followed), then it could not function when the enforcers of law (and therefore the threat of violence) are not present.\n\nSo, I cannot point to a law that is not in some way, shape, or form violence, I am just saying that is not all there is to it.  It must be internalized and legitimated.  Force is not enough, those who experience the violence of law against them internalize the rules of law, the laws dictate their actions, even without real punishment.\n\nResponse B Author: alecbenzer\n\nResponse B: I'm an AnCap, and so am pretty anti-government. That said, even \"market-based\" law is a threat of violence. Any enforced system of property also boils down to a threat of violence. The concepts of law and property are ultimately meaningless if you can't use force to prevent people from acting against them (well, maybe not _totally_ meaningless since they still can allow you to define things like theft, but they have no repercussions in the real world without enforcement).\n\nSomeone steals your TV -- if you try to take it back from them and they refuse, insisting that the TV is rightfully theirs (for whatever reason), you'll have to use force to take it back from them. If you don't, you will feel as though unjust force was used against you. So any time you have this kind of interaction between two people whose view of property differs, aggression from one side or the other is unavoidable.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author telegraphist's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Moreover, we've done a lot of work [mapping out where big asteroids are and none of them are in a path that looks that likely to be dangerous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-field_Infrared_Survey_Explorer). Even if one were, we'd likely have the tech within 50 or 60 years to easily move it. There are also groups like the [B612 Foundation](http://sentinelmission.org/) who will take your donations to help work against this risk. \n\n\nMany diseases already don't have vaccines. Worldwide outbreaks will suck but that's not a reason to think it will wipe out everyone, or even most people. And that's before we start talking about isolated populations like some tribes in the Amazon or some small island nations. There is an argument that better transportation systems make disease more likely to spread rapidly. There's empirical evidence that long-distance truck driving has contributed to the spread of [HIV for example](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11773878).\n\n\nDefinite problem. But actually wiping out all humans with nukes is not that likely. For example, most scenarios involving a USSR-US conflict in the 1980s left much of the Southern hemisphere intact. It is possible that this will cause a complete collapse of civilization as we know it, but that's not the same thing.\n\n\nWorld population growth is slowing down and appears to be stabilizing. Some countries like Japan are even experience population shrinkage. Also, not everyone drops dead at the same time when there's starvation: some people die and some people survive. \n\n\nYou cannot simultaneously think it is likely that two exactly opposite scenarios will happen. This is the worst sort of writing for your [bottom line](http://lesswrong.com/lw/js/the_bottom_line/).\n\nThere is a genuine reason to have a concern of this sort. There's a fair bit of evidence that there's some sort of [Great Filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) which prevents life from getting to be very advanced and spreading out to the stars. If there is such a Great Filter and it isn't something basic in our past (e.g. life from non-life, multicelled life from single celled life, development of a nervous system, development of writing, etc.) then the Filter of filters must be in our future. In that case, the most likely filters are those which would wipe out humanity or severely limit it. And that would have to happen in the next few hundred years. But only two of your examples, nuclear war and disease, have much potential to be any sort of late filtration event. \n\n\n\n\nResponse B Author: Millea\n\nResponse B: \nNot all life, but most in the past.\n\nHowever, it hasn't happened for in the last 65 million years. The probability that it'll happen in the next 500 is slim to none. Secondly, in the next 500 years, we may have developed technology enough to handle this problem.\n\n\nThere have always been people who are less susceptible to a certain disease than others. Secondly, there's always the technology argument again. Medicine has advanced greatly in the past 100 years.\n\n\nHumanity got through the Cold War. I think that it pretty much proves that people really do not want to press that trigger to end the world.  \n\n\nPeople have predicted this for hundreds of years. Over that time, the world's population has increased by a factor of 8.  If it keeps growing at that same rate, maybe. However, growth is slowing down.\n\n\nIt won't happen without human action.

I have noticed it is very hard for upper middle class students to find ways to fund college. Schools give out little grants to them and the government gives out even less. This, however, is justified in my opinion. There is only so much to give out. On the other hand I found private scholarships to be the most frustrating. Every single one that I applied for was \u201cbased on financial need.\u201c My academic and philanthropic resume didn\u2019t matter. All that was looked at was how much my parents made. \n\t\nI am not suggesting that I should attend college for free. I shouldn\u2019t.  However, there should be more ways for middle class students to help aid them. Many times poorer students get money from the school and government, and then from private scholarships. I believe there should be better ways for middle class students to find scholarship money to help them pay for college. \n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: convoces\n\nResponse A: I agree that college is often extremely expensive, even for middle to upper-middle class students.\n\nHowever, I experienced different anecdotal evidence, I found that while poorer students received more government aid: it was definitely easier for a middle class student to receive a private scholarship than it would have for them to receive government aid.\n\nSo, what is the reality? Let's examine a study done by the Institute of Higher Education Policy. they found that:\n\n\nThis suggests that middle school students do receive private scholarships. However, you may have experienced anecdotal evidence stacked against middle class students because there are private scholarships out there that are need based. For example, the Gates Millennium Scholars Program requires eligibility to receive a Pell Grant.\n\nHowever, The National Merit Scholarship Program, sponsored by the National Merit Scholarship Corporation, gives scholarships to students based on their performance on the Preliminary SAT which actually **favors** [higher socieconomic classes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/09/the-bottom-line-on-sat-scores-in-one-chart/) because students from wealthier families do better than students from less wealthy families.\n\nThere are a lot of private scholarships out there and many can be hard to find, but there are many that favor wealthier students. In general, poorer students are less connected and have less resources to even discover what scholarships are out there, so there is probably a greater effort to reach out/advertise to those students by the private organizations that provide the scholarships. So it might be that middle-class students need to exercise their resources to find the less-advertised private scholarships.\n\nThe main difference is that wealthier students tend to perform better academically because they have a more supportive and resourceful family structure, have better access to technology, and can receive costly tutoring, can afford standardized test fees (I know very smart students who couldn't afford to pay for AP tests, even though they could have scored highly), and don't have to work part time to support their families instead of devoting more time to studying.\n\nWhile poorer students *should* receive more aid proportionally than wealthier students, access to better higher education should be made easier for *everyone* in general across the board.\n\n\nSource: https://scholarshipproviders.org/Documents/PrivateScholCount.pdf\n\nResponse B Author: forloversperhaps\n\nResponse B: You don't get aid because your family lives a fairly expensive lifestyle and could easily fund your college education by cutting back on that lifestyle. That is what need-based aid means. The problem is that most middle-class families want to fund their children's education *without* giving up on all the comforts of a middle-class life.\n\nYou really either need to advocate free education for everyone out of tax revenue, or accept the system we have now.\n\n (By the way, I am assuming you really would receive need-based aid from your college if you could get it anywhere. If you come from a for-profit school or one that can't afford need-based aid for all student's that is different, and I understand your frustration to some extent, although your situation is very particular to a small group of people who don't want to go to an in-state public university but can't get into a need-blind school. Under a more genrous national university system, those schools probably wouldn't exist at all.)Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author convoces's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

People automatically assume that you are smarter and more trustworthy just because you are white.\n\n* They are attractive women -- I know that the counter argument for this can be phrased along the lines of \"women don't lead better lives just because men desire them.\" And, to an extent, I get that. But we really can't deny that attractive women enjoy a lot of \"free\" things that the rest of society doesn't; things that, when added up, probably equal a fair amount of money. There's also the counterargument that models (say) are more insecure than more average people. But I consider \"I feel insecure\" (which we all do, every single one of us) to be a pretty damn poor excuse for being able to charm basically anyone.\n\n* They are women in a society which is quickly changing to favor women -- Society today caters to women's needs. And, yes, it is true that women still get paid less than men, and so on. But more women graduate from college now than men, almost twice as many; girls do better in school than boys; scholarships exist for women to pursue male-heavy fields -- so in ten years I think the world will be much different. I also think that the world today encourages women to talk about their issues (male-female rape) while discouraging men to talk about their issues. \n\nI'm happy to provide much more information about my view. \n\nI realize that all of us have our own struggles, but seriously -- compared to a lot of other people, I really don't think attractive white women can or should complain all that much.\n\nChange my view, Reddit. \n\nResponse A Author: Bezant\n\nResponse A: There is a certain amount of 'easier', but there's also a lot that is more challenging.  Some paths are made easier and some are made more difficult.\n\nCould an attractive woman more easily find a well-off husband and settle down to be a housewife?  I don't think many people would argue with that.\n\nWhat if she wants to do something on her own though?  She can do something that revolves around her looks, but for most other careers she's going to face a lot of discrimination. \n\nShe'll be funneled into modeling, acting, etc, by the people around her, she'll be subtly objectified and taught to rely on her looks and that her looks are the most important thing about her, often by people who aren't even intentionally doing it.\n\nIf she does rely on her looks, in 10-20 years it may be gone.\n\nPeople will focus on her appearance and not her qualifications, intelligence, and work.  They'll assume she had it 'easy' and doesn't know how to work hard.  \n\nIf she does start getting promoted, many will assume it was because of her looks or she's trying to sleep her way to the top.  How many attractive female CEOs do you know?\n\nThere are definitely some benefits, and it's easier to simply 'get by', but there are downfalls as well.\n\ntldr: sure, if she's willing to go along with society's expectations of what an attractive girl should do.  Otherwise she has it harder.\n\nResponse B Author: binarysteen\n\nResponse B: I don't think society is changing to \"favor\" women. I think that women have risen to the challenge of being accepted in a society which traditionally has placed all kinds of barriers to prevent them from being successful in the same way men are. More women than men now graduate college, true. Does that point to a change in the education system that favors women, or does it point to men being complacent when it comes to further education whereas women are becoming more active? A lot of girls who are currently starting their careers have grown up hearing \"girls can do whatever boys can do\" and realizing that they might have to work harder to get there. This is women successfully rising to a challenge while men, who aren't told growing up that they're going to have to work harder than any other group of people, are coasting. This doesn't make it easier for women, it makes it the same.\n\nI also want to point out that there is a SERIOUS lack of women in STEM fields. The percentage of female graduates in computer science, for example, is abysmal and is actually getting worse despite the special scholarships (side note: men can get scholarships too if they bother to look for them and fill out applications). Considering that technology is one of the fastest growing research and industrial fields, it doesn't really matter that more women graduate than men. Men are still absolutely DOMINATING the fields where the highest-paying jobs are going to be in ten years (with the possible exception of medical careers).\n\nAs for the point about attractiveness, while it'll get you a free drink at a bar or a discount on something here or there, attractive women have a lot harder time being taken seriously as intellectuals than unattractive women do. Usually, a successful attractive woman will be known as a \"bitch\" in her workplace. I cannot count the number of times I've seen men do everything they can to undermine the intelligence of their female peers and superiors. It is not easier in this capacity. \n\nI won't say much about the white thing. I can agree that that's a pretty solid advantage.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Bezant's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I was being bullied over text messages, so I turned my phone off. They texted my brother relentlessly until he turned his off. Then, they called my home.

And the latter is EXTREMELY impractical if I want to have a career or normal functioning relationships with friends at a high school.\n\nCyberbullying is abuse, frankly. And, again as /u/Thronnuminous points out, it can lead to physical stalking, especially because cyberbullies especially tend to have these mind-sets.

Whether I morally agree with prostitution or not is not what matters here. The laws in the United States are set in order to protect the freedom, safety, and quality of life of the citizens (not willing to argue about this). Yes, the US has Freedom of Choice Act for all. And many try to use this to argue that prostitution should be legalized. One might say \u201cit is their own decision how they live their life and they are not hurting anyone else.\u201d However, the continuation of practicing prostitution IS hurting other people. In prostitution, human\u2019s bodies are up for sale- similar to a toy that is up for sale in a mall. And, just like a toy at a mall, the object that these people are offering can be bought\u2026 or stolen. Objectifying a person like this unleashes the idea that, just like with any other object being sold, (although it is not right) stealing is an option. This leads to abuse and violence. But this violence does not only affect the one person that chose to sell his/her body! It dehumanizes all people by alienating sexuality from a person and therefore fuels human trafficking. Legalizing prostitution would just say that all of this objectification is \u201cokay\u201d and the world would only experience MORE of the violent, abusive results that it already currently receives from illegal prostitution. Just like the act of murder hurts other people, the act of prostitution hurts people by promoting human trafficking. We need prostitution to remain illegal in order to try to protect every innocent life, not make it more possible that an innocent life will be hurt.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: hippiechan\n\nResponse A: My Law &amp; Economics class recently debated prostitution, and we read a couple papers. Let me see if I can make a solid argument based on that:\n\nProstitution isn't an object that you buy like a toy, it's a service. When you pay for a service, you are paying for someone to do something, whereas when you buy an object, you are paying for a physical good that has been produced or gathered by someone. This distinction is important; it helps to think of prostitutes not as prostitutes, but individuals who sell prostitution as a service, hence, can really sell any other skill as a service if they so choose.\n\nHence, we ask the question: If a person who believes they can market their sexual skills in exchange for money chooses to do so in a fashion independent of desperation or coercion, should they be allowed? In other words, excluding trafficking victims and so-called 'street walkers' who are in poor socioeconomic status, should people be allowed to sell sex for money? I would argue that a person who makes a rational decision on their own accord should in fact be allowed to do so.\n\nSuch a system ought to ensure that:\n\n* trafficking is tackled as its own separate issue\n* sex workers are given a safe working environment, regulated according to health and safety rules like any other business\n* sex workers have rapid access to necessary health, safety, and police services to report crimes of sexual assault\n* individuals buying services from prostitutes fully understand the liabilities, and risks present\n\nThe best way to organize such a system would be to allow prostitutes to receive registration and employment through brothels. Brothels could provide centres for which prostitutes could get medical attention, counselling, career advice (if they ever wish to leave the trade), etc, and when placed in commercial areas, may actually drive business the same way that bars and strip joints have been shown to do in the past. This, combined with multi-lingual counsellors checking in with *every* employed prostitute, would ensure that trafficking was at the very least reduced, and that prostitutes are fully informed of their rights. I believe that such a system is possible, and here's why I think it would be better than simply outlawing prostitution:\n\nFirst, prostitution is going to happen anyway. Ignoring prostitution doesn't make it go away, and while many countries have been successful at stopping it almost completely in its tracks (Sweden, Norway, Iceland et al), the few people who are still involved in the system (due to ever-existing demand) are at incredibly high risk of rape, assault, and even murder. I think this can be overcome by making it known that prostitutes are respected and have the help they need, when they need it.\n\nSecond, legalization combined with harsh anti-trafficking measures will help reduce trafficking instances. Studies have shown that legalization and liberalization of prostitution does, in fact, increase the incidence of trafficking to those countries when they are wealthy. However, many of these countries simply legalize prostitution and pay very little heed to combatting trafficking and black market prostitution in general, partly because of a mere failure to think of the problem, and partly because of the structures of legalization involved. Having support staff on hand will help victims of trafficking seek help, will inform them of their right to leave sex work, and may even provide intel on trafficking routes and leaders.\n\nThird, people who are buying prostitutes are facing a much different market. They can be sure that the people they're paying for to have sex are clean, not trafficked, and are in the sellers market because they want to be. While prostitution policy should definitely focus on keeping workers themselves safe and in good hands, it doesn't hurt that such a system would also positively affect buyers, and make them feel better about the transaction they enter in to with a prostitute.\n\n---\n\nSo, to summarize, I think that legalization, combined with an effective structure, harsh anti-trafficking measures, and a prostitute-focused mission to improve their lives is better than merely ignoring the problem, or even trying to sweep it away. This, of course, depends on whether or not you see prostitution as a social problem or a legitimate job, but I think that the fact still stands that prostitution will still happen whether or not you think it's a bad thing, so making them safer seems, honestly, like the best position to take.\n\nResponse B Author: pigeonwiggle\n\nResponse B: \ndo you see prostitution primarily as a Violent, Abusive act?\n\ni'm not saying abuse doesn't happen.  as with your point about the \"toy at a mall\" being \"stolen,\" there are people who will break laws.  and yes, prostitutes legal or illegal will always face the risk of abuse.  take the sale of alcohol for example, people steal bottles from stores all the time.  if alcohol was prohibited, there would still be \"rumrunners\" and the big question would be\u2026 would there be more abuse of the product if it was sold in secrecy, or in a legitimate environment with proper paper trails.\n\nyou seem to be arguing that the sale of the human body should not be treated like the sale of products.  and i'll agree with you.  the human body Shouldn't be for sale.  human trafficking IS a major problem in the world.  i disagree with your statement that prostitution counts as the sale of the body however.  it's the sale of a sexual service.  similar to how you may pay a massage therapist to work a knot out of some tense muscles.\n\nprostitutes are not dolls you pay to abuse, that's a viewpoint that stems from a prohibitive culture that has painted the sex industry in a hideous light.  please don't fall victim to this.  the more we accept women as equals, the more we adopt the notion of sex being an act shared, rather than a offense imposed upon someone, the better \"the customer\" will turn out.\n\ni think it's better to shift our cultural view of sex in this manner than it is to keep the opinion that prostitutes are victimized and that's the only way it can be.  if the first mime performers were abused, would we say \"hey, miming is dangerous, don't do it, say something.\"  or would we say, \"hey, what can we do to make things safer for mimes?\"Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author hippiechan's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

However helpful and useful that is in facilitating the exchanges between people in a system, it can't ever advance society. There is no aspect of business that can improve society as a whole.

But science is necessarily focused on the advancement of society.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: SeaLegs\n\nResponse A: A lot of your counterarguments are just claiming advances in business only facilitate the \"advancement\" of humanity without actually advancing it. However, you could apply that same argument to anything else. E.g., Medicine doesn't advance humanity, it just allows humans to live longer, which in turn advances humanity. \n\nIn order for any kind of discussion, you need to define what advancing humanity means. What knowledge or progression counts as advancement? I can't think of any definition that is not specifically exclusive/inclusive that would not include the advancements of business.\n\nTo address what you actually said: What about international affairs? International business and trade is probably the single most important driver of international cooperation. The EU is centered around it. NAFTA. US/Chinese peace.\n\nAnd how about resource usage, allocation, and efficiency? There are only so many resources, whether raw materials, labor, or time. All of these things have a value represented by money. Business people like capitalists and bankers are key in putting resources to work. \n\nThink about these simple examples: Currency was invented by business people. Before, bartering was the primary way to exchange goods and services. Currency allows any individual to purchase anything as long as they have enough value in currency.

CMV\n\nOp: I do not believe that the \"original intent\" of the writers of any constitution should matter in our modern interpretation of it. I live in Canada, so it is a little different, since some parts of our constitution are from 1867 and some are from 1982, but I think the same would apply to, for example, the US constitution. I believe a constitution is a guideline and a fundamental outline for a system of governance, establishing the basic rules under which it should function, but I believe that that definition should evolve with time and that the original intent, while having been important to the original writing, should not be important to the modern interpretation. For example, in Canada we have the \"living tree\" doctrine, in which the spirit of the Constitution rather than the literal text is considering to be more important. Although the Constitution does not mention sexual orientation, it has been considered to be a part of it by most of the legal system in recent years, because of that doctrine. The whole debate in the US about what the Founding Fathers would think of the world now just seems silly and stupid to me. Change My View.\n\nResponse A Author: laleonaenojada\n\nResponse A: First post on CMV, but US Constitutional Construction Theory is something I love, so thought I'd give it a try. Please note my entire comment will be pretty much based on US jurisprudence, as that is where my knowledge lies. \n\n\nI feel this sentence oversimplifies much of US Supreme Court jurisprudence. The debate is not so much about \"what would the Founding Fathers do\" (WWFFD?) but more about how much weight we should give to WWFFD. \n\nThe two sides of the debate are known as \"Originalism\" and the \"Living Constitution\" movement, and correspond roughly to Conservative (Republican) and Liberal (Democratic) interpretations, respectively. \"Originalism\" seeks to interpret and apply law (in this case, the Constitution) based first and foremost on the writing itself, and secondly on any additional writings or other evidence contemporaneous with the writing. For example, originalist justices (like Scalia and Thomas) generally do not find a right of privacy stemming from the US Constitution, as the word \"privacy\" is never mentioned in the document itself.\n\nIn contrast, the \"Living Constitution\" movement generally strays further from the original text, and seeks to take current conditions into account when interpreting the text. So using the \"privacy\" example from above, although the word \"privacy\" does not exist in the text of the Constitution or its Amendments, recent jurisprudence (of the last 50-75 years) has found a qualitative right of privacy protected by various provisions of the Constitution, most notably the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n\nIronically, the \"Living Constitution\" movement tends to think more about the *intent* of the Founders than the Originalists do. A Living Constitutionalist would say \"If the Founders were alive today, dealing with the internet, what would they want for the US?\" Originalists look only at the actual words of the Founders. But the Founders tend to exert more of an influence, so to speak, over the Originalists than over the Living Constitutionalists. \n\nPerhaps this is the best argument in favour of thinking about the original intent of the writers -- it actually tends to lead to more progressive results because original *intent* is used to interpret modern events, rather than allowing the words of 250 years ago to dictate our modern jurisprudence. \n\nI suppose for me, interpreting the Constitution is pretty similar to interpreting any text: you can make whatever argument you want, provided you can find textual support for it. This is the number one rule of literary analysis from every literature class (English, Spanish and German) I have ever taken. The only difference is, the Constitution is the founding document of a country. It creates an entire socio-political system, a whole way of being. So interpreting it, trying to find textual support for your arguments, becomes exponentially more important. \n\nAs a result, I believe we should definitely care what the authors thought. It maybe shouldn't be the end-all and be-all of Constitutional interpretation (as the Originalists would have us believe) but the text, and any contemporaneous documents or accounts, should certainly be the starting point. Still, the Founding Fathers obviously couldn't foresee many events that have happened since 1789, and so I ultimately fall on the \"Living Constitution\" side of the debate: how could they possibly have written or thought anything about the internet? But the spirit of their desires for their country, our country, can still be found in the text they wrote, and should be applied and considered when regulating the people of that country. \n\nResponse B Author: yep45\n\nResponse B: What if we wrote a law today that was intended to do something, and it was interpreted a different way years later by people with a political agenda? When you debate and pass a law, you expect it to achieve a certain purpose and to have a very precise meaning (that's why we always have so many lawyers nitpicking about the exact wording of statues). \n\nIt nullifies that entire debate and the democratic process as a whole if the meaning of that law can morph over time until it is unrecognizable to the original. This is not to say changes to the law should never happen, but they should be preceding by a new public discourse and formal revision. Doing otherwise would be essentially like breaking the rules of the democratic process. \n\nThinking of the Constitution specifically, the Founding Fathers, for all their internal differences, had a much different collective vision for the country 200 years ago than we have today. The Constitution even included previsions for its own amendment if there was sufficient public support - so why not just do that if people truly want a change, rather than saying it is okay to change the meaning over time through a non-democratic process?Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author laleonaenojada's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

In the past few years, the use of hops to add flavor dimensions to many brews is overdone.  This is especially true when you consider that just about every craft brewer has an IPA (India Pale Ale), which are noted for being highly hopped.  Many of the brewers pride themselves on the IBU (International Bitterness Unit) numbers for these beers, trying to push them further and further into bitter territory.\n\nThis discouraging in many ways.  First, it leads to a false perception that craft beer *must* be bitter.  It also means that other styles of beer, either imported or from craft breweries, are needlessly crowded out of the discussion.  I personally am a fan of many of the Belgian styles, (for example the abbey dubbels, and abbey beers in general). Many Belgian beers are willing to use some more interesting ingredients that would get overwhelmed by too hopped.  Outside of that I find  I also like bocks, doppelbocks, porters,  and others.  But the choice is becoming limited because so much shelf space is being taken up by IPAs and their kin.\n\n\n**tl;dr** I think the increasing number of IPAs is limiting choice and creates a perception that shortchanges the truly wide variety of flavor profiles beers may have.\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: BigcountryRon\n\nResponse A: Supply and demand.  I guess IPAs are selling.  It is what I drink.  I prefer APAs (IBU 35-40), but will settle for an IPA.  \n\nI don't think the choices are getting limited.  I think it is getting more people away from Coors, Miller, and AB.  It got me into brewing my own beer, and broadened my horizons. \n\nWhere do you shop for beer, that could be the issue?\n\n\nI noticed you stated elsewhere you are from Texas.  Does Shiner Bock count as a craft beer?  I always drink that when I go down there.  I love it.  Is it hard to find Shiner Bock because of all the Sierra Nevada?\n\nI honestly don't know anyone who thinks craft beers are all bitter, except my buddies who drink bud light (but they think Yuengling is bitter).\n\nThe market will balance out.  Unless everyone loves IPAs so much.\n\nResponse B Author: unloufoque\n\nResponse B: There's a little more to this than just supply and demand.  That is a major factor, yes, but it doesn't paint the whole picture.\n\nOnce upon a time in America (before it was legal to homebrew), if you were drinking beer, you were drinking Bud, Miller, or Coors.  Thin, watery lagers that came in a can and didn't have much flavor.  What flavor was there came from the malt.  They are clean and their aftertastes don't linger.\n\nThen homebrewing becomes legal.  People start homebrewing and sharing their beer with their friends.  People like the beer and the homebrewers start breweries.  This is an oversimplification, but it's kind of how a lot of early breweries (and even still today) got started.\n\nThe first craft brewers had to compete in a market that was saturated with cheap bland lagers.  They needed to make their beer instantly discernible from the big three.  Since what little flavor there is in those beers comes from the malts, hops were an obvious choice.    Thus, many of the first craft beers in America were hoppy.\n\nMany contemporary brewers \"grew up\" drinking these early, hoppy beers.  That's what they were used to and what they liked.  They liked the bitterness, so they increased it.  The increased availability of international beers (along with festivals, etc.) stretched their palates and exposed them to other styles, but many keep returning to the beer that got them into beer in the first place.\n\nDifferentiating yourself from the big three is still important today.  They still control a vast majority of the market share.  They are still among the cheapest beer there is.  Many people are first exposed to beer through the big three.  I also prefer, say a bock to an IPA, but if all you've ever had is Bud Lite and you have a bock, you might think that they taste kind of similar.  Sure, the bock is likely to be better, but is it worth the cost?  It's much harder to compare BL to an IPA, so it's much easier to determine that the IPA is worth the extra cost.\n\nThis is not a bad thing.  IPAs are not crowding other styles out of the market.  The market is currently rich and vibrant, with entirely new styles being created (e.g., White IPA, which is not really an IPA at all), and old styles being spread and respected (e.g., Sam Adams has a doppelbock.  It's okay.).  It can be a daunting hobby to get into at first, but most hobbies are.  \n\nThe perception that craft beer has to be bitter is not necessarily wrong.  Craft beer has to be *something* to differentiate itself from the big three, and bitter is a real easy way to do that.  Yes, there are other ways, but bitter is probably the easiest.  It's definitely the most popular.\n\nYour point about fewer people venturing into craft beer is either pure speculation or just plain wrong.  Craft beer as an industry is growing like crazy.  Last year it grew 20% in dollars, an increase from the 17% dollar growth in 2012.  [Source.](http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/business-tools/craft-brewing-statistics/facts)  Maybe more people would start drinking craft beer if it was, on average, less bitter, but it's hard to believe that the industry could really grow much more than it already is.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author BigcountryRon's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

The formalities that surround it arose out of a necessity to know who is supposed to be responsible for which kids, which people are supposed to inherit the property of diseased people and so on.\n\n\nFor several thousand years it has been the duty of clergy and religious institutions to formalize monogamous relationships into marriage, which is still the case in several countries. Only recently, with the advent of supra-religious states brought about by the French Revolution has it been made into a secular issue.\n\n\nIt wasn't something that people only started doing after someone voted for a law to bureaucratize it, but the other way round: it was something that was good, and only then did states decide to appropriate it for their own sake.\n\n\nThe state doesn't regulate marriage because it's good for people. It does so because it is good for itself. The modern State is more powerful and overbearing than any institution that has ever existed in human history. It has no business regulating human relationships.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: NoNameMonkey\n\nResponse A: I think we can start by saying that at one point the church was the law.  They regulated marriage.  Now, in a more secular age governments do that.  I am pointing out that your comparison is not entirely without fault.\n\nSecondly I think you go straight to the idea of a modern single father and single mother relationship to describe marriage.  Marriage has actually meant various things in different times.  I assume you are religious and even the bible endorses several forms of marriage.  The idea of a single man and woman as a married couple was never universal.\n\nEveryone below makes good points about what marriage means legally so I wont address it.  I am going to use an example from my own country - South Africa.  Here it is legal for men of certain cultures to marry multiple wives.  Culture is a sensitive thing here but government has kind of been forced to get involved in order to protect the rights of the women in these marriages since the existing laws don't cover this type of marriage and there has been lots of abuse as a result.  Our government - for all its faults - has taken on a major job trying to formalise this practice in a way that respects cultures but ensures people have legal rights as well.\n\nBasically I think you have a certain idea of what marriage is.  I think it is informed by seeing it through the eyes of a society that has benefited from the legal framework it exists in.  You idealise what you think it was meant to be before governments got involved but you havent considered that it was always under some kind of law - before it was just the Church and not government.  The legal rights of people need to be protected within marriage and that is something the churches have not done adequately and are also not in any way responsible to do.\n\nI say churches because you have to consider other religions or cultures when you look at this situation. As in the example I gave of my own country, the existing religions and cultures are not able to protect the rights of the women in these relationships so government must intervene.\n\nResponse B Author: BrellK\n\nResponse B: \nLet's get something straight here. First of all, people have been doing monogamous relationships for far longer than any religion has existed. Yes, we have done polygamous relationships as well, but there is no reason to think that religion has a monopoly on unity between two people. Second, the \"duty\" you talk about was performed most commonly not for love, but for duty, treaties, merging of properties, etc. If you think that marriage has recently been \"corrupted\", then certainly that would apply to the idea that it is about *love* at all, when this certainly wasn't the case in most early societies.\n\nNow to the most important point...\n\nNobody is *forcing* you to get married, or even register your marriage with the state. People make the argument you are making, and I genuinely have to wonder if they understand how marriage works in our society.\n\nYou are not prohibited from living and loving any person of the opposite gender. The government is not going to arrest Tony because he loves Andrea, or because they live together.\n\nIf you don't want to give the State \"power\", then you don't have to apply for Marriage status, and you can just tell everyone you are married without having it be recognized by the state.\n\nThe State *does* have a vested interest in Marriage though, and that is why it provides a legal shortcut for couples who want to register. Again, couples **DO NOT HAVE TO REGISTER IF THEY SO CHOOSE.**\n\nThere are tons of these \"legal shortcuts\" that Marriage provides, which is one of the reasons why Homosexual Marriage is gaining more steam. There are *tangible* benefits that can be gained by registering your marriage with the State.\n\nDon't think of it as the state saying \"We are officially sanctioning your relationship.\" Instead, think of it as the state saying the following...\n\n\"We understand that you two people are in a relationship that combines many legal aspects of your persons together. Therefore, if you wish to register with us, we can make it much easier for you to combine your persons legally, instead of both of you having to do each part individually.\"\n\nAs I said before, the State regulating Marriage is more about convenience of legality and it is certainly not about them deciding who is allowed to love whom.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author NoNameMonkey's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I feel that someone who has been charged and found guilty of driving while intoxicated has already endangered others, and will do so again as most drunk drivers do, unless he is forbidden from driving in the future.

I would argue that a combination of such technological fixes, raising the legal liability of those who loan their vehicles out to DWI repeat offenders, and aggressive legal prosecution (including harsher sentencing for repeat offenders) would be an alternative fix to the DWI recidivism problem, one with many fewer negative effects than the system you propose. After all, someone who is going to be a repeat DWI offender is likely not going to allow minor technicalities such as an ability to get a driver's license stop them from driving again, so your proposed fix is probably going to be less effective than you might hope. \n\nOn the flip side, I know people who were prosecuted for DWI as high school students with barely illegal limits of alcohol in their blood and who caused no accidents at the time. With age (and spending time in the pokey) came wisdom and they've had no problems in the decades since. Punishing a minor for the next sixty years over a bad decision made early in life is not a measured response--we don't even do this with first degree murder in many cases.

All of these people are driving dangerously and putting others at risk in much the same way that a drunk driver does; they just haven't been stigmatized in the same way.\n\nIn your post, you assert that most people who are caught have already driven drunk many times.  That implies that *the vast majority* of drunk driving incidents result in no accidents, injuries or fatalities.  You also assert that most drunk drivers will do so again; in fact, [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2853607/) suggests that rate of offense goes from about 3/1000 in non offenders to 25/1000 in first-time offenders.  The recidivism rate is high, but the fact is that most first offenders don't offend again.  With that in mind, the draconian punishment you describe doesn't appear to be necessary.\n\nOn a more practical note, the US has built many of its communities and much of its infrastructure assuming that most people can drive significant distances.  For example, I *need* to drive in order to work and go to school.  There's no viable alternative.  If I were to go out tonight, get a DUI and lose my ability to drive, I have a limited set of options.  Moving isn't possible, nor is getting a job closer to home.\n\nThe end result is that I *will* drive, whether the law says I can or not.  I won't feel the need to insure my car, because if I'm caught driving I'm screwed anyway.  If I do get pulled over for any sort of traffic violation, I'd probably just floor it and see if I can lose the cop.  I imagine this is what quite a few people would do in this scenario, and that makes the roads markedly less safe.  Also, if somebody were driving drunk and saw blue lights, their best course of action would be to floor it and get away from the cop.  What's the risk of an \"evading arrest\" or \"reckless driving\" charge next to the loss of driving privileges for life?Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author __Pers's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I realise that there are other systems and values that can be considered when deciding who gets to use a service first, and I am more than happy to use these systems when they are presented. For example, separate queues for people who need different amounts of service time and the like (10 items or less checkouts).\n\nbut 90% of the time, a simple queue is the best way to determine who gets served first, not a scrum of people crowding around the service elbowing their way forward with no regard for politeness or etiquette, this is the kind of systems which promote different values for who gets served first, values like being pushy or being physically attractive, values which I believe pale in comparison to 'was there first'.\n\nThis is a big problem in two places, bars, and everywhere apart from England (a joke, I assure you, though a pointed one). Bars get a small pass because I understand that standing behind someone is a really hard concept to grasp when you are drunk, but less sarcastically, there are space concerns and bars/nightclubs seem to be a place where politeness goes to die.\n\nAs for the second half I just don't understand, why can't people understand that a disordered scrum just isn't fair or dignified and reduces us to piglets suckling at their mothers teat.\n\nSorry for being a little overly British, but I have just returned from a three month stint travelling around Europe and this point really struck me.\n\n\nResponse A Author: Hq3473\n\nResponse A: Sometimes, it is simply more fun to scramble and scrum! Sometimes, getting there is more important than the actual destination.\n\nFor example:\n\nPeople enjoy the bouquet throwing tradition at the wedding. Single women line up and try to catch the bouquet in a \"scram\"  fashion:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3c3YJC2xOw\n\nWould  it be fun if bridesmaids queued up, and the first one in line got the bouquet?\n\nSimilarly, I would argue that in certain venues (e.g. bars) creating the atmosphere of chaos is just part of the fun, part of the experience (like in the  bouquet throw example).\n\nP.S. I think the word \"queue\" has too many vowels. CMV.\n\nResponse B Author: thecornersoftoday\n\nResponse B: The only places I've visited which don't have queues are ones which deliberately try to cultivate a casual atmosphere. So it's not that the establishment thinks queueing is not a fairer and superior method of serving people, it's that they think it imposes formality which would be undesirable to their clientele.\n\nTake bars for example: bars don't have a \"please wait to be seated\" sign; they don't have cutlery set out on the tables; and yes, they don't have lineups at the bar. They want to have as few processes as they possibly can, because that's what their customers want.\n\nSo in the end it's subjective: you probably don't think queues are onerous at all, so your bar experience wouldn't be diminished by waiting in one. For most other people, however, queues impose structure that they're deliberately trying to avoid by going to a \"fun\" place like a bar.\n\nAnd to hammer this point home: notice how bars and clubs always have queues outside the door if they're at capacity? It seems contradictory at a glance, but it's because they don't care what the atmosphere is outside their bar/club. And if atmosphere is out of the picture, then it's obvious that the best thing to do is have a queue.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Hq3473's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: If this has been posted before please let me know:\n\nTo start off let me say I have nothing against feminism as a movement. In most cases it's a healthy fight for equal rights. That said, I believe that feminism has changed enough through the years to now be considered egalitarian/ humanitarian. \n\nAnytime I get into a discussion with someone who identifies as a feminist they go on to talk about how they believe in equal rights for all not just women pretty much the same as you would think of an egalitarian. I honestly feel that this would help get rid of the radical feminists who are far too aggressive and questionable as to what their true end goal is as well as get rid of the negativity that rides along with the name. \n\nOf course there is still an unequal spectrum of rights towards women and of course there is an issue when there is negativity towards a movement just from the name, however through egalitarianism there could be, at least I feel, a much stronger push towards the equal rights that many people strive for. \n\nAs for other movements, including racial rights movements, I would personally also like it if they could change towards this as well for the simple reason that people aren't just focusing on what is happening to them, but instead to everyone around them. It would turn into more of a discussion than a mud slinging contest of (for example) MRAs and feminists going at each other for no reason other than pre-conceived notions that each group has of one another.\n\nI've been told before that there is historical significance to the name and people would not want to simply cast it aside for another due to that significance. As for that I honestly feel like it's strange to have egalitarian views but do so under a gender specific namesake. \n\nI'm honestly interested if I'm missing something here or what someone on the flip-side would have to input. Also sorry for the grammar, I just kind of threw my thoughts into this one after the other.\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: Late to the party so not sure if anyone will see this:\n\nI think the real reason why we use the word \"Feminism\" is because we acknowledge that, although this is at heart an equality movement, many women are suffering to a much greater degree than men - and thus it is women that need to find a rallying ground in order to tackle their problems. Obviously men also have problems we need to address, and I wholeheartedly agree that men should be considered much more within the framework of feminism. This is a problem that exists more prominently, I think, in some more developed countries - that can perhaps afford to move on with the inclusivity movement.\n\nHowever, it still remains that female genital mutilation is practiced on a systematic basis for thousands of girls in African countries, that female infanticide still exists even in more \"developed\" parts of east and south east Asia. When we talk about gender equality, in this context we are first and foremost giving women a rallying point to talk about themselves. Yes, this may delve into affirmative action. But isn't that what equality movements all start off as being? Racial equality lead to positive discrimination, as a way to correct social wrongs temporarily. When the time comes that we don't need to worry about the huge, wide-scale threats to girls and women around the world, maybe we won't need to use the word feminism - which essentially points to a strong, global sisterhood that is still fighting against the remnants of patriarchy.\n\n**TL;DR We forget that feminism is a global movement, and is often more for those in less fortunate situations than most of us here. Until basic human rights have been secured for women in such situations I think the focus on the female half of gender is morally sound and justifiable.**\n\nResponse B Author: Revoran\n\nResponse B: Most feminists (the non-radicals) believe in equality between the genders for all. However, they are still *primarily focused on addressing women's/girl's issues*.\n\nThe premise of modern feminism is that females are an oppressed class in society as compared to males who are not in general an oppressed class. This leads feminists to focus mostly on issues that affect females (like slut shaming for instance) because they believe that getting rid of \"the patriarchy\" (a catch all term for a \"man's world\" and traditionalist victorian values) will lead to women no longer being oppressed and brought up to the level of men.\n\nThe movement is primarily focused on the status of females and issues that affect females. It is not very focused on men. According to modern feminists: at best men need to be silent allies of the women, at worst they are misogynistic oppressors.\n\nSome feminists will give some variation of \"patriarchy hurts men too!\", but these same people would still refuse to believe that males are just as disadvantaged (albiet sometimes in different ways) as females.\n\nThe matter is further complicated because a lot of women would say \"yeah I'm a feminist\" when in fact they don't know much about the movement and may not act very egalitarian. Casual feminists, I guess you could call them.\n\nBut in the end, the movement is **focused on females**. Calling it anything other than \"feminism\" or \"women's rights\" would be false advertising.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author [deleted]'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Age 22.\n\nBackground: \nI am a typical Asian-American and I grew up in a traditional Asian family. My parents immigrated from Asia to give their children (me) a better future in America. Because of my parent's pressure wanting me to succeed and obtain a successful job with high income so that they can retire early, i have instilled a mindset that \"time is money\". Unused time means lost of potential money.\n\nProblem:\nI started having this mindset near the middle of high-school. During that time I realize why am I wasting my time playing games? Why I am wasting my time hanging out with friends? I could be spending all of this time to further develop my skills and gain new experiences. In college, that mindset has hit me even harder. I see all of these college kids socializing, having fun, \"wasting away their time\" that could have been used to study or work or to do something productive. \n\nAs I grew older and learned more about what's available in the world, I decided that my interests and work ethics match me well for a Chief Technology Officer career. I like the science and technology side of how things work and I have done much R&amp;D research in college. I also like the business side, leadership skills, and challenges involved. Since I am already working as hard as a CTO, i thought this dream position would also fit me as well. I am considering a PhD as well since many CTOs do have it. But PhD students also work 70+ hrs a week so they can graduate on time.\n\nBecause I have been so heavily invested in this mindset, reality just hit me. I am incredibly tired, internally as well. I have not had any vacations in the past two years. During Christmas break, I stayed at school and worked on my projects. I worked as well during spring break. As soon as summer started, I started my internship. And as soon as my internship ended, I came back to school to continue working on my project. \n\nThis negative \"time is money\" mindset of mine also repelled a lot of friends. They want me to go out and have some fun, but I pessimistically reminded them that they are wasting their time having fun and could be doing something much more productive. So now I also feel quite lonely with not many friends to reach out to.\n\nNot only that, but my social skills are lacking and I still have not had my first girlfriend or my first kiss yet at the age of 22. (I have tried to pursue girls actually, but my mindset was, I need to get a girlfriend so I can get this over with and continue focusing on my career which let to numerous downfalls.)\n\nNow that I am reflecting, I have focused on my career so much that I gave up everything else in my life. It is really hard for me to swing out of this mindset that I have had for the past 7 years.\n\nI am starting to think CTO is not something I want to do if it means sacrificing another 10 years down the road. I want to convert my mindset to live a working 9-5 life and come back home worry free to enjoy other aspects of life that I am currently missing out on.\n\nI hope someone can help me. I feel so miserable right now although I'm not worried about my career options after I graduate.\n\nThanks so much! \n\n\n**Update**\nThank you everyone for helping me to clarify the problem with my current views. This is not something I can turn 180 on with a flick of a switch, but hopefully I can transition to a more balanced person because rewards and happiness can come in all types of form.\n\n\nResponse A Author: goocy\n\nResponse A: How should we change your view when your view is about self-reflection? The only thing I can do is to give you a hint where you went wrong.\n\n\"Time is money\" is meant as a reminder to not waste time on unproductive tasks. It is important to know that this is effective *only for things that you don't want to do*. It's designed to stop you from doing chores that take a long time and are way below your paygrade. It does not apply to free time.\n\nFurthermore, it doesn't even completely apply in your case. Spending fun time with your colleagues has long-term value because you're able to share job openings with each other in the future - a feature that may be even more time-effective than building job skills as long as you keep both in balance.\n\nResponse B Author: DashingLeech\n\nResponse B: I don't think you need to change your view so much as \"correct\" it a little with some minor tweaks. First, \"time is money\" should really be \"time is currency\". It shouldn't be taken to mean that \"time spend doing things that don't earn you money -- even future money -- are wasted\". It is more basic than that: your time can be traded for things of value (to you).\n\nThe second tweak is to include the things of value to you in the concept. Sure, a successful future career is of value to you, but so is enjoyment of your time now. \n\nIf you want to go all financial on the concept, what is the risk-adjusted current value of the future outcome of that hour you spend now, compared to the value of the time spent enjoying it now? Sure, if you spend *all* of your time playing games or socializing then the future might not be as great as you want it to be. But there's diminishing returns. The difference between working on your future career 90% of the time versus 100% is very small compared to 0% versus 10%, even though it is the same amount of time. As long as you put in decent effort, that's the bulk of the future value. Beyond that, your current value of enjoyment starts to exceed the current value of whatever more time you spend on your future careers.\n\nSo spend you currency wisely on things of value to you.\n\nAll of that aside, social skills and the ability to enjoy things and bring enjoyment to others, and have people like spending time with you, are far more important to getting to the top (e.g., CTO) than technical skills. Always remember that Steve Jobs and Elon Musk didn't succeed because of their technical abilities, or working non-stop; their success came from understanding people, and a lot of luck.

If a procedure is expensive, unavailable, or illegal in a person's country of residence (it could be anything from cosmetic surgery to various dental procedures to abortions and euthanasia), an alternative is to fly to a country which provides the service under more desirable conditions. \nIn my opinion, government regulation of this industry constitutes a violation of personal liberty, undermines the economic growth of the prospective destination countries, and inflates the price of domestic healthcare by forcibly eliminating foreign competition.\n\nExamples of regulation include limiting travel to government approved zones, countries, etc; limiting the kinds of treatment allowed (e.g. banning certain procedures deemed to dangerous, or perhaps banning travel for procedures which are illegal in the country, like abortions or euthanasia); making the buying of insurance to cover the procedure compulsory; and so on. It could also be controlled by the receiving countries: in a \"third world\" country a government may not want scarce medical worker resources going toward rich white people.\n\nResponse A Author: natha105\n\nResponse A: I think you should look at this from the position of a government.  Your domestic healthcare policy decisions have been made for reasons that the government considers good ones.  For example the government has set training standards, hygiene standards, and ethical standards for medical procedures.\n\nThere is, for example, a reason we do not allow a seven year old girl to get breast implants.\n\nNow those policy decisions have consequences in the real world.  The price of an operation is higher, the range of surgeries available to the public is narrowed, and there might even be a wait for a specific procedure.  This results in a demand that is not being met.\n\nForeign countries can fill this demand, the question is should they.  I think that in some instances yes they ethically can and the government of the home country should not interfere.  In Canada or the UK for example there are often long waits for surgeries due to public financing of the health care systems.  If patients wish to go abroad for treatment (to the USA specifically) it is win win.  The patient gets treated early, someone else moves up a spot in line back home, and the domestic system saves money.\n\nHowever if someone wants to have their six year old daughter given breast implants and finds an indian doctor willing to do it I think the government very much has a role to step in and say no.  I think this is what should change your view - that there are certain extreme cases where very clearly the government of a country has made the correct moral decision about a procedure and can and should impliment laws to stop people from getting it abroad.  Another example would be the MS liberation treatment that was a scam.  Researchers in the field thought it was dodgy and ran studies to confirm but in the meantime huge numbers of people wanted a dangerous and useless procedure.\n\nThe middle case, not being able to afford care but finding it cheaper in india, is a harder example and I leave that up to each person's own moral judgments.  However I think the above should change your view.\n\nResponse B Author: BlueApple4\n\nResponse B: Safety I think would be a huge issue. The US would have no control over the product manufacture or product safety. Pharmacovigilance is a huge concern. If someone gets a bad does of drug, you need to be able to track down where it was produced and fix any potential issues with manufacture. If a company makes a medical device or product out of cheaper, but less durable material it could potentially cause issues that can show up after the patient has returned to the states. If you get a knee replacement, and your knee shatters because the surgeon put it in wrong, you have no recourse (you can't sue). Not to say that every country has backwards medicine, but their is no control on what their safety regulations are. \n\nIn terms of illegal procedures, you are still bound to the laws of your country even abroad (i.e it is still illegal to provide alcohol to adults under 21 even in a country where the drinking age is 16).\n\nI would also think that medical tourism would be bad for a developing country. Why would you focus on delivering quality healthcare to your own citizens, when you can make much more money on medical tourism.

I do believe that the majority of people are, in fact, corrupt. So assuming you take a random person and insert them into a position of power, it is likely that they will abuse the power that is granted to them. But, I also believe if you take a person who isn't corrupt, and insert them into this same position of power, they will not abuse the privileges and power of the position that is granted to them.\n\nI think teachers illustrate this point very well, especially because it is much easier to become a teacher than say, the President of the United States. In this regard, you tend to have a larger sample size and have many more types of people to consider. In most cases, I would say that teachers tend to have absolute power over their classes, at least with regards to day-to-day activities. (Generally, if a teacher says to do something, it is expected that the student comply to the demand of the teacher. If the student disagrees, typically the matter is resolved at a later date with the intervention of a teacher's superior.)\n\nTaking this assumption that teachers have absolute power over their students, you still tend to find a balance of teachers who abuse their power, and those who don't. If the saying that \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\" were true, all teachers would abuse their power, since it is the power that corrupts the person, and not the person that corrupts the power.\n\nParents work well for this example as well. Literally anybody can become a parent, as having a child is as easy as having sex. I would even say that parents definitely have absolute power over their children, even moreso than teachers. But even with parenting, you still tend to find a balance. Some parents are incredibly strict and unfair, dictating arbitrary rules for their children that they themselves may not follow, or rules that have no legitimate reason other than \"because I say so.\" (I'm not arguing the fact that sometimes parents use the \"because I say so\" justification even if the rule does have a legitimate reason, but sometimes parents don't actually have a reason other than \"I say so.\") However, you also find parents that are incredibly fair with their children. If a child does not agree with a rule set by a parent, and argues his or her case fairly, there are parents that would reconsider and change their rule for the sake of being fair. If \"absolute power corrupts absolutely,\" parents like the latter would not exist, as the power they hold over their child would corrupt them.\n\nTL;DR: CMV: Absolute power does not corrupt absolutely; absolute corruption corrupts power absolutely.\n\nResponse A Author: iserane\n\nResponse A: It's true that there are good seeds and bad seeds in any grouping you can think of. People typically take actions based on incentives. The power itself doesn't do anything, but in positions of power you generally have better opportunities. The better opportunities often involve pandering to another parties wants and needs. Lets say a company wants to pass a bill and needs people to advocate it. They'd likely reward an advocate that has some authority (like a doctor, senator) much more so than they would reward a random person on the street. The position of power provides access to better opportunities, and those opportunities are often what people view as the corruption aspect, but the reward is so great that it's worth it.\n\nIt's like gambling, if the reward provided is large enough, people are more willing to engage in risk-taking behavior.\n\nResponse B Author: ADdV\n\nResponse B: I would really encourage you (and others) to watch [this TED-talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsFEV35tWsg).

He is an authority on this topic, and he believes that good people can turn evil based on the situation.

Their payments never stop.  They can't save for retirement or afford to send kids to college. All that money they spend on shelter just evaporates (goes to the landlord). With rent abolished, they start making mortgage payments, and after 15years, they stop paying. Now they can save and send their kids to college and help their kids buy homes. Their children have children and sell the original family home, allowing the grandparents to pass on the value they invested to their grandkids, so the grandkids can buy homes and send *their* kids to college. \n\nNow imagine everyone doing this. No one gets obscenely wealthy and no one is able to draw merely passive income, but everyone has a home and land within their family. Within three generations we can solve a great many economic and social problems, all by eliminating rent. Our society must stop feeding off itself by chasing some elusive (and immoral) dream of passive income through control of property.\n\n(1) **Should we outlaw Renting?

I don't understand how people are even able to pay their rent... Most of the rent people pay us goes toward our mortgages, the rest goes into repairs. All we do is shuffle money around. We don't realy add any value to the system, and I hate it... If you want to change things, look at laws concerning home building. Eliminate restrictions... superfluous requirements and you'll see cheap housing start to appear. You'll put my family business out of business, but everyone will be better off, including me. I'll get a basic income too.\"\n\n\n*****\n\n#**Minarchist Libertarian Government**\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, I will give the Wikipedia definition:\n\n*\"Minarchism (also known as minimal statism) is a political philosophy. It is variously defined by sources. In the strictest sense, it holds that states ought to exist (as opposed to anarchy), that their only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from aggression, theft, breach of contract, and fraud, and that the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military, police, and courts. In the broadest sense, it also includes fire departments, prisons, the executive, and legislatures as legitimate government functions. Such states are generally called 'night-watchman' states.*\n\n*Minarchists argue that the state has no authority to use its monopoly of force to interfere with free transactions between people, and see the state's sole responsibility as ensuring that contracts between private individuals and property are protected, through a system of law courts and enforcement. Minarchists generally believe a laissez-faire approach to the economy is most likely to lead to economic prosperity.\"*\n\nThis would mean that some bare minimum of appropriate taxes would still need to be collected to fund the minimum level of government necessary to ensure the above mentioned services, along with a Basic Income. (I consider this a \"necessary evil\".) This also means that the courts would no longer enforce or hold legitimate any Rental agreements (just as one could not sell themselves into \"voluntary slavery\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*****\n\nI know this is a *HUGE* post with a lot of assertions, but I hope to get some great responses based on the voluminous fodder for discussion.

These are people and corporations that earned that money in a capitalist country, legally. Poverty is the governments responsibility (legally, morals are a different story but don't forget about philanthropist). It is lazy to see this problem and blame the successful. I think it goes against everything this country stands for.\n\nResponse B Author: dilatory_tactics\n\nResponse B: Yes this should happen.  We need global private wealth caps / effective income caps in order to keep people from making gobs of money off of leverage / credit / fake money and then absconding into the night, along with a million other reasons.  \n\nHowever, you will never ever ever convince those in power that this should happen, because you can't rationally convince someone of an argument that they have a vested interest not to accept.  FrankP3893 for example, will never accept that this is a problem that needs to be solved, and instead will argue that taxation is theft.  \n\n\"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\" - Upton Sinclair\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10625608/Winning-the-lottery-makes-you-more-right-wing-study-finds.html\n\nWe need to organize an MLK-style march on Washington, demand [global private wealth caps](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/opinion/capitalism-vs-democracy.html) and [effective income caps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uskJWrOQ97I), and keep demanding them in the face of all the establishment bullshit arguments that it can't be done, shouldn't be done, etc.  \n\nWhat we need are organization, marches, and persistence, not rational argument, because the 1% and their apologists will never ever ever ever be convinced of the merits of a policy that taxes let alone caps their own wealth/power, public policy be damned.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author FrankP3893's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Help me CMV.\n\nOp: Search turned up different topics, so here goes:\n\nHere and there, I hear about bitcoin. About using your users' processing power to, without informing them, mine for them, about fractions of one having considerable values, about enterprises that start accepting it.\n\nAnd all the way, I can't shake the feeling that it's some... some sort of happy fun-time make-believe pretendy currency, something the very rich or very gullible invest in as if it were an actual, useful currency. Or worse, are being conned into doing so by _somebody_ who's going to one day quietly pack up the money and leave and won't be discovered until somebody else tries to cash in and it's far too late. Or a big, *real* organization, with money and lawmaking clout to spare, is going to go \"Okay, fun's over\" and fuck it all up somehow.\n\nAnd even then... it's data. How do you stop it from being duplicated? Who protects it? Who can you _trust_ to protect it if it's meant to be, well, decentralized?\n\nSo yeah. I get the feeling there's something I'm just not seeing and I think it's high time I found out what.\n\n\nResponse A Author: MeanOfPhidias\n\nResponse A: Currency is arbitrary.\n\nIf you say that bitcoin is a delusion then you are saying that the mathematics and the protocol are a delusion - which they are not. \n\nMy favorite metaphor:\nBitcoin is a universal, open accounting ledger than anyone can read. Miners are competing for a chance to write a page in the ledger. When they do that they receive a reward and they write all of the transactions to the page. \nThey compete to write a page by making a guess at a random, huge number that requires time to calculate. \n\nAs far as delving in to the math:\nBitcoin uses 2 main algorithms that have been peer reviewed and studied and in use for a while. SHA-256 is the one I am best at explaining. SHA-256 turns data in to a 256 digit number. Just how large is a 256 digit number?\n\nIf you stood on the moon and threw a rock at the Earth and we divided the Earth in to equal sized parts and had 256 \"digits\" worth of parts wherever that rock lands would strike billions of parts. In fact, 1 proton would cover approximately 10 parts.\n\nIf you took the known universe and divided similarly - equal parts 256 digits worth of parts - then every 900 atoms would equal one part. \n\nEffectively, miners are picking random 900 atom parts of the universe and saying \"Did I find it?\" every time they make a guess. A difficulty is in place to throttle the range of guesses so that one occurs every 10 minutes (roughly).\n\nHow do you keep fake data from being inserted?\n\nThink of a torrent. Anyone around the world can file share with a torrent. That is how we share the blockchain - or the ledger. If 51% of the network says \"This is what is in the blockchain\" that is what is in the blockchain. If the other 49% disagree they fork off. Right now, the hashing power of the bitcoin network is greater than double (I think double now) the world's top 500 super computers put together. \n\nHow do you prove you own bitcoin?\nBasically, pgp encryption. This has been in use a long time. You have two large numbers mathematically linked. They can encode/decode data between each other. You distribute one number. This is your \"public key\" If can decrypt messages from your \"private key\" - you keep your private key hidden/to yourself. Your public key can also encode data only your private key can decode. This allows you to have completely anonymous, secure communication AND proof of identity/ownership of the private key.\n\nSo I send you 1 BTC I encode the transaction with my private key and include your public key. Someone mine's a block, they write a page in the ledger that says I sent you 1 BTC. Using the public keys you can see your balance.\n\nIt doesn't end there.\n\nEven if the worst case is true - it's a long con and a delusion. Just this technology in this form is greater value than bitcoin will ever be. This is the future or contract law, property rights, proof of publishing. The list goes on and on. That's the real value to bitcoin.\n\nResponse B Author: gox\n\nResponse B: There are many excellent responses here, so I'll just address the concerns.\n\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n\nBitcoin is built using two different mathematical concepts, which feel magical when you encounter them first because they are somewhat counter-intuitive. These have been around for some time.\n\nFirst is [public key cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). It basically lets you prove to others that you possess some secret, without having to reveal it. Bitcoin utilizes this so that, having the secret to an \"address\" enables you to create transaction using the money assigned to that address. No clearing authority is necessary, because it's easy to prove by anyone mathematically.\n\nAs a result, even if the Bitcoin network collapsed or taken over, people still wouldn't be able to create valid transactions to spend your money. Neither the creators and developers, nor some attacker or a network majority can access your money.\n\nActually, in Bitcoin, there is no \"ownership\", but only possession, much like cash. If you share your secrets (private keys) with someone else, there is no way to tell who the real owner is. This is a relatively harmless side effect on relying purely on mathematical proof.\n\nHowever, as you might have guessed, since these are completely numerical thingies, something has to prevent people from spending the same money on multiple different things.\n\nSo the second concept is, [proof-of-work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system). Actually, it's not proof-of-work that is revolutionary, but the idea of using that in order to create a decentralized notary system.\n\nSince we only want the transactions to be unique, but don't need to make a judgement about which conflicting transactions to pick, any difficult-to-meet-but-easy-to-verify criterion can be used to mutually agree on any group of transactions that are valid and consistent. We need such a criterion to be able to make a universal objective decision.\n\nWhen someone comes up with a consistent list of transactions and some extra data to meet that criterion, the list is spread around the network together with the said data. This list is called a block, and trying to find numbers to meet that criterion is called \"mining\". When a new block is received, miners start working on a different list of transactions, which need to be valid and consistent both within themselves and with all known transaction history (i.e. the block chain).\n\n\nThe Bitcoin \"mining\" power is now magnitudes faster than all the supercomputers combined. That being said, some entity with deep enough pockets can attack it. It's not at all clear whether Bitcoin would lose though. It will be an arms race, and the worst case scenario is that Bitcoin will be forced to become more centralized than it is now. Best case scenario under such an attack would be ending up with a more resilient \"mining\" criterion.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author MeanOfPhidias's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: Why do sound technicians ruin so many indoor gigs by turning the whole volume up (especially the bass) so loud that the entire thing becomes distorted and mushy? I love loud music as much as the next person, but the volume level of music at gigs is absurd. I saw Less Than Jake at a very small venue (with a capacity of about 500 people at most) and the sound levels were absurdly high - the whole thing became a disorienting blur of sound. Recently I brought ear plugs when I went to see The Bronx, and the experience was incredible - I could actually hear the songs in a clarity that was comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nIt seems to me that seasoned gig goers and sound-techs alike simply don't mind how loud live music is because their ear-drums have been significantly dulled from years of going to loud gigs (effectively removing the need for ear plugs). For those of us with hearing mostly intact, I think gigs are absurdly loud, and sound-techs could reduce the volume by up to 50% in many cases for a much more pleasurable listening experience - still loud, but not so loud that the vocals and rhythm all fuse into what can be, effectively, white noise. In any case the bass needs to come down. When the bass is so loud that you feel your clothes rippling: something is wrong. And yes, I blame the sound-techs and not the band. Being in a band myself, I know that it's very hard to tell what you sound like from the audience when on-stage, even with monitors. \n\nSo I think that gigs should be quieter. This would not only be more enjoyable, but spare many people the hearing loss later in life that live music can cause. I don't think it should be acceptable to have a gig so loud that you hear a ringing in your ears the next day. Change my view.\n\n--------------\n\nP.S. - I go to gigs in London. Maybe this isn't such an issue elsewhere in the world.\n\nP.P.S. - As you may have noticed in the title, I'm only referring to indoor gigs. Outdoor gigs still tend to have sound issues of their own, but their volume is generally at a much more comfortable level due to the sound having room to disperse rather than bouncing off walls in an indoor environment.\n\nP.P.P.S. - I'm referring specifically to 'guitar oriented' live music. The issues in quality of sound are rarely - in my experience - present during a classical orchestra concert, or a jazz/swing band gig.\n\nResponse A Author: fierceman\n\nResponse A: I may not want to change your view about the volume problem, but I do want to change your opinion regarding who is at fault.  Full disclosure, I have been working professionally as a sound engineer for 15 years. I'm not saying that the sound engineer is not also a part of the problem. The fault lies with many parties.  As a sound engineer, I fight band stage volume on every band I work with. Many times I have a producer (who writes my paycheck) telling me to turn it up. The guitarist whose amp is turned up to eleven.   The band manager who wants the whole thing turned up.  The drummer. (Enough said.) \n\nAnd yes, many sound techs just turn it up because the sound system can get that loud, not realizing that there is a difference between can and should.  I do the best I can to never mix bands anymore because it's not fun, it's just loud.  Plus, I think it may be worse in the US here as there are no local regulations that I know of for volume limits as there can be in the UK. I hope you can see though that there are many factors involved in creating that sound, and that when a show is too loud, a lot of people can be to blame.\n\nResponse B Author: EtherialBungee\n\nResponse B: I actually agree with you largely. However, a lot of the problem lies on the band itself. As a guitarist, I never would have believed it. But I absolutely did once I shifted into live sound.\n\n1) Drums are fucking loud. Ever hear a drummer tear into a snare? Ever hear one smash his cymbals? In some small club shows, there's almost no need for a mic (except for the thump of a kick, and a little added sound just so nothing gets lost). \n\n2) Often, especially with rock bands, the guitarists feel the need to have guitar amps WAY overpowered for the space they're playing in. Nobody actually *needs* a 100 watt, 8x12 guitar amp and cabinets. 30 watts and a 10\" speaker are more than enough once you have a mic on it. But so many bands crank up their amps to the point where what you're hearing in the audience doesn't have anything to do with the sound guy and everything to do with \"but I NEED to have my amp turned up!\"\n\n3) Way too much bass is a bad thing, yes, but at the same time please remember, your hearing probably isn't going to be damaged from bass that's too loud. It takes a hell of a lot more low-frequency power to do any remote sort of damage to your hearing than you will ever notice in a lifetime.\n\n4) PRO sound guys (not just the tech at your local night club) aren't dulled from years of loud gigs. We actually carry custom-moulded earplugs designed to reduce SPL without changing the sounds we're hearing (too much). What you have to understand there is that MOST concert-goers only see an occasional show. The loud volumes won't do much damage if it only happens once or twice a year. Touring engineers are exposed to it every single day, often over 100 nights a year, plus soundcheck, rehearsals... I'd absolutely recommend earplugs for any frequent concert goer. But it's not going to affect 75%+ (depending on genre) of the audience to see one show that's a bit too loud. That is, assuming this last factor is not in play...\n\n5) A lot of times, it's a crapshoot as to what a venue has when it comes to sound. I tour with a national act, and I call venues before every single show, often two or three times, to make sure what they have will be good enough. Half the time, what I walk into is nothing like what they said on the phone. Or they have the whole rig set up wrong so it's not actually working at its full potential, or it's far too powerful for its own good. The problem gets even worse if the band doesn't have their own engineer; then it's entirely up to a house tech who is usually inexperienced or has already blown their ears out, or both. A band that carries its own sound system is going to be much better, but they're also going to only play larger venues like arenas, and they'll have time to fine-tune the system to work perfectly for the room.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author fierceman's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Not usually where I live, but yes, there's a voice inside me that yells \"more fasterer! Better! Better!\"\n\nNow, I know there are some people with big bandwidth requirements -- those doing some major file sharing, or maybe needing a big pipe for a VPN to work. But I think that in the commercial marketplace, that's a small percentage.\n\nI thought about this recently when a friend of mine was looking at his options for getting Internet services. He opted for the cable modem at 25 Mbps because it was faster than the DSL offering at 12Mbps, which is what I have. And I thought about it, knowing what he'll do online... surf the web, stream some audio, watch Netflix once in a while -- and even for that, 12 is overkill, let alone 25.\n\nI know that the providers have to have significant bandwidth in their infrastructure, but I feel that consumer offerings of 25, 30, 50 Mbps and more are really just selling people the *idea* of a super fast connection that they'll really never use. CMV.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Bob_Sconce\n\nResponse A: First of all, recognize that when an ISP \"offers\" 25 Mbps service, that's a maximum -- there may be times when you can actually get 25 Mbps (when, for example, nobody else is using their network), but because they over-subscribe their service, you might be down at 5 Mbps or worse during peak times.\n\nAlso, recognize that the 25 Mbps is the maximum in the so-called \"last-mile\" and says nothing about the rest of your ISP's network, or its connections to other networks.  Netflix ran into this problem with Verizon recently, where Verizon's internal network was fast, but they refused to add additional links to the connection between Verizon and Netflix (despite all the demand from Verizon customers for such a connection).  As a result, a bottleneck was created.\n\nBut, finally, recognize that there is a chicken-and-egg problem here: If, say 25 Mbps service is impossible to get at a decent price, then there will not be anybody offering up internet content that makes use of that service.  After all, why spend a bunch of money putting something on the internet that nobody has the technical ability to receive?   \n\nWhat would those services look like?  High-quality 1080p video, for example, can chew up 10Mbs.  And, what if you want video the other way-- say you have security cameras in your house and want them monitored (and recorded) remotely?    And, there are surely other applications that nobody's thought of yet.\n\nResponse B Author: antiproton\n\nResponse B: \nThere can be up to 4 simultaneous instances of Netflix running in my house at any given time. I'm talking a family here, not a Frat house. It's not common, but it happens. Streaming video is what the internet is *for* today. \n\nAs video gets higher and higher in definition, people are going to demand more and better access to that video. Watching a 480p Youtube video feels like the stone age. When a high-def video on Youtube or Netflix downconverts to a lower resolution on me, I'm assuming someone fucked something up because I'm simply no longer used to slumming at less than 1080p. \n\nAnd that's just video. Any number of other things could be going on here during prime time. Everyone has a tablet, a desktop or laptop and a roku in the room they're in, plus the phones in our pockets. 25Mb/s is pretty much the minimum we find tolerable just for normal, everyday entertainment.

Social skills are useful, and if you don't have any you won't fit well in your team and may have more difficulty than you should getting jobs.  But I can tell you that I use things I learned in class every day of my professional career.  I've never gotten a job or proved my worth because I went to some party in college.  I've never hired anyone who couldn't prove themselves in a technical interview because they were fun to be with.  And if your skills and knowledge aren't enough to do your work, it doesn't matter how much fun you are after work- your coworkers will try to get you fired.  Social skills are a nice bonus, they're not more important than technical skills.\n\nAs an aside, that bullshit about college networking?  I talk to one friend from college regularly. I have gotten 1 job lead from a college friend in the past 13 years-  and that company regularly has people reach out to anyone they have on facebook with the required tech skills, it wasn't because I was a fun guy.  In fact they had already sent me an \"are you looking\" ping by a recruiter about 6 months before that, so I was already on their radar.\n\nIn short-  make friends and have fun, but pay attention to the course material.

First we need some science!  My central thesis will be that the 'singularity' happened a long long time ago.  Here's how\n\n1) Fact:  The human body contains more bacterial cells than human cells.  This is due to the fact that bacteria are much much smaller than human cells.  These bacteria are usually helpful to humans, and we couldnt live without them.\n\n2) Fact:  No signal neuron in your body defines 'you'.  It is the complex interaction between many neurons that help define a sense of 'you'.\n\nNow a question to motivate our thinking:  Can you build me a smartphone from raw materials all by yourself?  The entire thing?  Including programming it? I'm willing to bet you cannot.  In fact, no single person can.  But our society can.\n\nYou see, it is my assertion that our society is a large living organism and we are like the bacteria or neurons or whatever.  Each one of us is a bit of biomatter that has a small function in a vastly complex system.  This system grows and even reproduces (England giving birth the the US, or 13 states becoming 50).  It has naturally organized people to be able to build complex things by making people specialized at specific tasks, in the same way that bacteria in your intestine break down vitamins for digestion.  \n\nThis organism has learned some amazing things, and stored pieces of it in various brains.  It then evolved a network to connect those brains (language, internet etc.) so that the information could efficiently flow.  We are living in the superorganism NOW! \n\n People have a tendency to call brick structures 'artificial' 'unnatural' 'inanimate' but if you think about, they're not much different from proteins, except in chemical makeup.  Proteins start as DNA sequences, then RNA, then transcription into a peptide chain that folds and performs functions for the cell.  The cell then divides and divides again, eventually making a person,who then picks up raw materials and builds a house.  I dont have, in my mind, a break between the house building and the protein.  In the same way that a bird's nest is a 'natural' thing, so are our structures.  I see these structures as proteins for the super-organism.  This thinking helps me with questions about what my purpose in life is.  Mostly, it's to be a good bacteria and do my job so the superorganism is healthy.  I dont have global reach, but I do my best within my small sphere of influence, and if others do the same, the organism thrives.\n\nAs for getting rid of humans, I really doubt it. Our relationship with the world is changing.  Maybe we'll interface with computers more and a gradual process will result in a different species a thousand years from now; an unrecognizable descendant from ourselves, but that's not 'eradication'  that's evolution.\n\nTL;DR:  You're living in it, and you didnt even notice.\n\nResponse B Author: ezen\n\nResponse B: I think you're assuming that singularity = machines (mechs) that can walk and talk (cyborgs) and generally can manufacture at will. The Singularity can and most likely will occur in a massive supercomputer at some lab or private company (IBM).\n\nOnce the amount of calculations can be achieved, an AI still needs to be programmed and it has to be at least good enough to fix itself. This is no small feat but is probably attainable at some point. Once again, once this happens, you're still left with an AI that could figure out problems in its own code and reprogram itself quickly and endlessly at will.\n\nAll this being said (and there are a LOT of assumptions), you'll still left with an isolated program. There are quantum (or pseudo quantum) computers out there solving issues with code by running all possible combinations to find bugs or simulated user errors. This is probably the sort of role that a computer system would play in this.\n\nRealistically, the only way that singularity could lead to The Matrix is if we build machines capable of physical feats (like building their own manufacturing plants), keep them hooked to each other (wireless network of some kind), Singularity happens, and the AI decides to do something crazy with that power.\n\nWant to stop the singularity?

My reasons for thinking this is because I have the right to choose who I date or marry, I have the right to set some personal criteria for potential partners, and they have the right to not date or marry me if they have problems with my criteria. I'm not truly excluding anyone because its a matter of compatability and personal choice. Not every woman who has an accidental or unplanned pregnancy wants to have an abortion. Yet my nieces said that I can't honestly be supportive of pro-choice if I won't give women who have had or will have abortions the \"fair\" chance of becoming romantically involved with me, but when I ask why, they can't give me a straight answer. \n\nSo CMV, am I in the wrong? If so please CMV.\n\nResponse A Author: Daedalus1907\n\nResponse A: \nI can sort of understand not dating someone who would have an abortion since it could be that you feel strongly about keeping any unplanned pregnancies so you don't want to risk the woman aborting the fetus. Although, I think this is a huge stretch considering you could talk to the woman and judge this factor individually. I think refusing to date someone who has had an abortion is what seals the deal on your view being \"wrong\". It demonstrates that you believe having an abortion (Or even believing you might have an abortion in reasonable circumstances) leaves a permanent black mark on a woman. \n\nResponse B Author: MrAkaziel\n\nResponse B: I think what's bothering your nieces is that you're adopting a \"do what I say, not what I do\" kind of position.\n\nIndeed, you're saying you're pro-choice but in practice you're clearly sending a message to any woman who can be attracted to you that you think less of them, at least to a romantic point of view, if they share your opinion on abortion. It's like saying \"I'm not racist, but I won't date any woman who's not a member of the KKK\".\n\nSo, for you nieces, you're probably making pro-choice position looks bad because you consider it's a flaw for a woman to hold it while still saying you support it, hence the intellectually dishonest label they give you. \n\n\nNow, if we go simply by your topic's title, yes it's fully possible, but you're playing with cognitive dissonance there.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Daedalus1907's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Then they get into the real world and see a movie like \"The Interview\" which is making fun of Kim Jong Un. Imagine if someone made a movie about you that is about people trying to kill you. It is simply cyber bullying. \nKim Jong Un is not a good person, and certainly is not trying to help the citizens of North Korea. However, you can get into trouble in school for cyber bullying someone who has even bullied other people him/herself. If Obama defends Sony for cyber bullying Kim Jong Un, why doesn't he defend cyber bullies in schools? Isn't is freedom of speech too?\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: Kim Jong Un is one of the most evil men currently alive today. His actions are qualitatively different from \"bullying other people,\" since he has sent people to prison camps for the rest of their lives and commanded and condoned the murder of many others.\n\nTo concretize this, here is an example of an evil thing Kim Jong Un's regime has done.\n\n\n[Source](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korea-sentences-american-matthew-miller-to-6-years-of-hard-labor/2014/09/14/aa91ac40-3c05-11e4-b03f-de718edeb92f_story.html)\n\nCan you imagine the rage and anguish this man and his family must be feeling? How would you feel if this happened to you or one of your loved ones on a visit to another country? Isn't this wildly disproportionate to Mr. Miller's offense and a violation of his rights?\n\nNo moral person should feel any sympathy for Kim Jong Un, and every moral person should wish for his misery and death. Furthermore, satirizing Kim John Un is helpful and necessary for undermining the credibility of this evil man and highlighting his depravity, which is not a justification that real cyber-bullying ever has.\n\nResponse B Author: xiipaoc\n\nResponse B: Kim Jong Un being an evil dictator -- which he is -- kind of negates that.  He's no Hitler, of course, but only because North Korea isn't powerful enough to start annexing its neighbors and has no substantial minority population to send to death camps.  So, yes, the movie is \"bullying\" a dictator, and of course he isn't going to like it.  But he likes oppressing and torturing his citizens, so I'd say his priorities hardly count.\n\nBut let's talk about what you call \"freedom of speech\".  The idea is that you should be able to say anything without restriction by the government, and *not* that you should be able to say anything without consequences.  You're still liable for what you say!  Conspiracy to commit a crime is speech and it's still a problem, not because of the speaking but because of the crime.  Bullying is another kind of speech that hurts people; it's not the speech that's illegal but the hurting of others.\n\nBut you're saying bullying of bullies is still bad -- well, sure, but Kim Jong Un isn't a bully.  He's a murderous dictator.  Bit of a difference there.  As a public figure, he's a valid target, but remember libel and slander are still illegal!  As a work of satire, The Interview avoids that part, and since he's an evil dictator, we really don't care whether he likes it or not.\n\nMaking that movie about a regular dude -- or even a celebrity -- would be grounds for a libel/slander lawsuit.

I feel about it pretty strongly and all of these are basically going against most relationship advice I hear that is considered mature, while my mentality is often regarded as shallow or immature. I wand to understand better where the other side is coming from.\n\nTitle explains it summed up, here are my arguments and additional views that may be relevant:\n\n1. Relationship is not superior to being single and should not be searched for at all cost. Relationship should be wanted only when there is a person you want to be in a relationship with.\n\n2. You either want someone or you don't. You are either attracted to them or you aren't. They can be nice and compatible, but if they aren't what you want, there is no point in trying to make it work for the sake of being nice or fair. Relationships aren't deserved.\n\n3. Preferring physically attractive people does not make you shallow. In fact it is shallow to assume that relationships are so important that person's preferences in them determine their whole depth as human beings.\n\n4. There is no objective measure as to what should or shouldn't be changed for the sake of your partner. You have to take the person for what they are and not imagine you will change them, or compromise and change yourself for them (unless it is a change you want to make yourself.) For example, it is considered unreasonable to expect your SO to stop talking to someone you don't like, but it is reasonable to expect your SO to stop drinking every day. In my opinion, no one owes their partner a change, and no one owes a relationship - you can leave over anything you don't like and you don't have to change anything you don't want to. BUT there should be no hard feelings because neither side is a bitch or a jerk for their choice. It's not a moral issue either.\n\n5. No one owes a relationship. It is ok to only want sex with someone hot over wanting a relationship and looking for \"deeper\" things, that isn't in any way a moral issue.\n\n6. Standards aren't objective, even though many people might share the same standards. You don't have to give back everything you expect, you simply have to know what you want and someone either fits or doesn't.\n\n7. It is stupid that people get offended for not being someone's type. You aren't hurting anyone by not wanting to be with them over something, even if they think the reason isn't fair. Relationships aren't favors or rewards anyway. \n\n8. There is no bad reason to end a relationship. I keep hearing people say how someone broke up with them over something dumb - think of it, the dumber the reason someone breaks up with you over, the more it means that the relationship wasn't that important to them in the first place. Which means the break up was necessary, even more so than when people in love break up over something big and understandable. \n\n9. Being with someone, or staying with someone, you don't want the most is harming not only you but them as well. Someone might like them more than you do, so committing yourself while not that attracted or for the sake of keeping the relationship effort was put in is in fact disrespectful to the other person. Therefore they should not get angry but understand the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever problem still is that these type of relationships may not be something many people can handle, at least not at this point. But a lot about them makes so much sense to me that now I would change the focus of this view all together because it is only a little part of a much bigger problem underneath. \n\nResponse A Author: upvotz4u\n\nResponse A: The interesting thing for me is that I think I agree with all of your points and can't find a massively great specific rebuttal to almost any of them, however I have a general rebuttal.\n\nOne thing I'd like to point out is that many if not most of the points you present seem to possibly imply that all relationships are or must be, by definition, monogamous.\n\nI think most of the points you gave are actually excellent general reasons for a given person to perhaps consider polyamory instead. It's still quite socially taboo, and though I'll probably take heat for this, I tend to notice most people are far more accepting of gays/lesbians/whatever than they are of polyamorous people.\n\nI don't know if any of the following directly addresses explicitly any of your numbered points but I think it at least implicitly addresses some of them.\n\n1. Level of desire/level of willingness to change/no one owes anyone anything.\n\nYeah I pretty much agree on this aspect, and I think it's kind of a perfect rationale for polyamory.\n\nBefore I go further I'd like to clarify that while very obvious in its slant, this post is in no way trying to say that polyamory is the only or the best arrangement for humans and that much of the stuff I point out is the general state of the emotional psychology of the human species. I myself tend towards a desire for monogamy, but I think there is ample rationality to support the idea that polyamory may be a better overall social construct by which to conduct our lives.\n\nFriendships are relationships too, and I think far too many people make the mistake of both ignoring friends as potential sexual partners, and also the converse mistake of assuming their sexual partners are automatic loyal friends. I think there's a certain level of deep satisfaction that is achieved in friendship and I constantly hear people talk about a break up as having lost \"a best friend\".\n\nConsider maybe humans would be better off if we completely removed the social stigma of who people have sex with when and why and the limitations and restrictions of only being able to have sex with a single person at a time. There would probably be far more opportunities for all humans to find not only friends but sex partners as well. There would probably be far more opportunities for you to have sex with one of the select few highly attractive people that you say are the only ones you're attracted to enough to consider having sex with. I think a vast majority of potential sexual relationships don't occur simply out of social stigma for not wanting to be seen or known to be having sex with another person for various social stigma reasons - that person is a geek, or fat, or otherwise socially unattractive, yet in my experience, often times the growth of genuine close intimate friendship starts to trump those originally perceived problems. I think shallow is a term leveled by people who are probably shallow themselves because of exactly this reason - that they know there are many people with whom they'd gladly and willingly have casual (but really nothing is ever casual) sexual relations and with whom they'd like to develop a deeper/further/lasting/intimate friendship/bond but they avoid doing so because of perceived social stigma and not because of their actual internal desires and also because doing so would likely preclude the possibility of being able to \"do it\" with someone better if someone better came along. As the saying goes, the grass is always greener.\n\nAlso given that we have placed this social emphasis on being exclusive to a single person at a time, that leaves very little room for leeway in bad behavior and it brings about conversations and discussions on an order of magnitude that is blown far out of proportion to what normal people engage in in their normal every day friendships. While it sometimes happens, friends far less often badger their friends to stop drinking than do monogamously romantic partners. The simple reason for this is that friends usually have other friends they can go hang out with and don't have to put up with Bob's drinking but Bob is still fundamentally fun to hang out with and drink with from time to time. When a person is stuck with a sexual partner, there tends to develop a pretty intense desire for that sexual partner to be adequately fulfilling, and the ways in which that partner is not adequately fulfilling are magnified far more times over than would normally be the case if that relationship were more like a good/intimate/deep regular friendship. So people try to change each other.\n\nSecondly, lets consider the situation of human happiness/satisfaction/fulfillment in the context of statistical analysis.\n\nI feel there is an artificial emphasis on romantic relationships presented to society by the media, however caveats come to mind. Humans are an explicitly social species, bears are not. Humans have grouped  together and have thrived in communities and with social constructs. Bears are highly independent and very much a \"loner\" type of species. Not that there isn't room for humans to be quite diverse, but I think it's arguably true that humans are a highly social species. As a highly social species, humans generally benefit from human contact, and specifically from alliances known as friendships as well as alliances known as romantic relationships. Now yeah sure, penguins mate for life, but then again penguins rape each other and steal from each other. I'm not advocating that we go out of our way to be like penguins, but that we look at the realities of the proclivities of the human species. It turns out some people do desire monogamy, and I'm not saying monogamy is bad - rather that especially with points/positions like yours, that maybe some kind of alternative arrangement is both highly prevalent within our species historically and also highly utilitarian. Most all close relationships and alliances might be good and beneficial even if not perfect. You can learn to like something or come to appreciate something that you don't like initially. People often are cold/distant with each other at first and then open up as time goes on and they come to know and trust and see the emotional welcoming warmth of the other person, they come to see the other person as another person, not a stranger. Maybe the warped view of relationships that the media presents as so irrationally necessary despite there not being great reasons to enter them has to do at least partially with the fact that the media by and large only really presents monogamy as the main viable option and with the importance of intimacy to the human animal, most human animals find themselves in a somewhat desperate situation to both fulfill their need for companionship and sexual release, but also stay within the bounds and confines of the standard social norms.\n\nNow with all this said - humans should be free to choose, without social duress, what actually suits them best. I wouldn't blame anyone who said \"I really just kind of like sex and I just want to be able to have sex with attractive people from time to time without the hangups\". I don't think that's shallow at all, I applaud the direct honesty of such a statement as it stands in stark contrast to the obfuscation presented by much of society, and I think there's a lot of facing of hard truth there that a lot of people would rather not face - or at the very least they don't want to be seen rocking the boat.\n\nNow with THAT said, let me propose, that maybe it's possible that another factor is at play here, which is the media's warping of the general public's sexual ideals to lust after only the most perfect bodies and to pay less attention to the quality of the interpersonal communication and emotional give-and-take economics at play wherein each party gives some type of pleasure/benefit to the other and that there's this artificial emphasis on only being allowed to do this with someone deemed by the outside observers looking in as socially normative - i.e. attractive man, attractive woman, do the ooh ooh, make attractive babies, yay good.\n\nI think that in the calculus of love, so to speak, one should factor in a few things - what are the chances that I'll actually ever meet anyone sexually attractive enough for my \"standards\" combined with what is the overall cost benefit ratio of \"holding out\" until you find such a person versus the cost benefit ratio of being willing to engage in intimate behavior and sexual release with a range of different people because such things are beneficial for the emotional well being of the human animal. Considering that \"holding out\" is really only a \"hold over\" from the idea that monogamy is the only viable option and that if people were more socially sanctioned and allowed to have sex with their close/intimate friends etc without a big to do around the whole situation, that maybe the statistical likelihood of human satisfaction would be served in a far greater capacity.\n\nAlso, if it's that easy to find sexual partners with which to be reasonably fulfilled, there would be far less \"honey stop drinking\" kinds of arguments, and far less enabling in situations like that. Also if it's that unfettered to be with anyone that you deem worthy in your own eyes, and society were to stop judging people (as much as they do anyway) for their imperfect (and I'm not talking obese, cuz some things are still just bad/unhealthy etc and should not be condoned and no one should have to learn to like it) body images, that maybe more people would have more happiness in life and maybe relationships are actually quite a critically important health factor for the emotional wellbeing of the planet.\n\nResponse B Author: conspirized\n\nResponse B: This is probably going to be mostly anecdotal, but that seems to be the context of the discussion so try not to hold it against me.\n\n\nRelationships should not be searched for at all costs. Someone should not have to be in a relationship to be happy. You will, in my opinion, be better off if you ensure your happiness while single and then pursue a relationship. I think we're on the same page there. Logically speaking, though, being in a relationship is in fact superior to being single *if you are in a healthy relationship.* In a healthy relationship two people transition from the simple aspects you mentioned (companionship, sex, etc.) to actually building a life together and that is much easier to do if you have a partner. Two people can make more money than one person can. Two people can better raise a family than one person can. Additionally, it's my experience that having a significant other to help you deal with your issues does in fact work better than having friends or people on the Internet. I don't have the same connection with guildies I met three years ago and have gamed with (and met up with) since then as I have had with some of my partners simply because they were always there and they were always face to face. Maybe you have better friends than I've had, but in my experience even your best friend will not care as much about your problems as a decent lover.\n\nThat being said, I'm not sure if you're trying to justify never pursuing a relationship or if you're just trying to say that your methods are morally fine. If it's the latter then I can say as long as you don't feel entitled to a relationship in spite of your methods (and you don't seem that way) then it's fine by my book, but in all actuality your morals are the only ones that matter so who really gives a fuck what anyone here thinks? If it's the former I'd say that everyone definitely should be on-point and ready to pursue the man, woman, or whatever of their dreams because you'll get greater satisfaction out of it. As long as you don't let that pursuit define you as a person I don't see the harm that can come from it.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author upvotz4u's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

My reasoning is that they will tend to favour one of their children, whether that be something along the lines of listening more to what, let's say, their youngest child, and will defend that in an argument where they have to choose between their children.\n\nThat's of course only an example. If they don't have to choose between their children, they will obviously love their child. They will obviously defend their child with their very lives (hopefully, because if not, they're not good parents).\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that when parents have to choose between their children, they will often gravitate towards one of them.

It's impossible for me to put an amount on the love I feel for my kids. It has no weight or size. I think the only way you can find out which kid you truly love more is if you knew which one you would give up in a Sophie's choice situation. Otherwise how is there a way to prove it? For me personally I have NO clue which one I would choose and would have to go with the most logical choice of who I think would make the biggest impact on the world. It makes me too fucking sick to even think about it. \n\nNow, the thing I DO think is measurable is the amount of preference you have for one child over another. For me it varies depending on the situation. My daughter fits my personality more and is more calm like me and that's easy for me to be around. My son has \"ADHD\" (which I hate labeling him as because I don't like looking at it as a disorder, but a way to describe his brain) so he's very active and can't sit still. It can be very wearing to deal with the constant movement. But because his brain loves the movement, he loves driving in the car and I can just sit there and talk to him and the one on one time is my favorite. I do think I tend to have a preference for my daughter more often because I understand her more than anyone else because of how similar we are. The way she reacts to situations I can remember having those exact same feelings. She's also SUPER snuggly like me and will just snuggle for hours and hours.

We frequently underestimate how foundational slavery was to the construction of the modern era; if anything, it was modernity which 'barbarized' (barbarianised?) the world. \n\n\nSlavery was at the core of modern colonial expansion; there was no work done during this period that did not rely on regimes of unfree labour to render cheap commodities available for the global market. Whether it was sugar, spices, gold, silver, iron goods, molasses, rum or any other commodity you can think of, there is a link to the economic institution of forced unfree labour (what we call 'slavery'). The above commodities were traded for people in western Africa, alongside iron goods (chains, manacles, locks, guns, ammo, gunpowder etc) and were used to collect more captives to sell. These captives were then forced through the 'middle passage' to America. Once there, the captives would be sold and traded for raw materials which were transported back to the mother country (until American independence, when they started exporting their own manufactured goods. Again bolstered by unfree labour.) For more information on this process, google 'triangular trade'. \n\nEntire cities were born and grew fat on the trade in slaves: London, Glasgow, Liverpool were all built as manufacturing centres for slave-labour raw materials like sugar cane, cotton and raw minerals. Entire nations grew fat on the trade in slaves (I'm looking at you, Canada, U.S, Australia, New Zealand etc etc etc). Science, also modernity's child, is not exempt. Entire fields of 'science' were created to justify these racialized social hierarchies: the most common example being phrenology, but there were plenty more. (For more information, google \"Human Zoos\"). \nMany modern financial institutions had their start in the slave trade, including banks (Lloyds, Barclays), insurance companies and financial speculators.\n\nNot only was slavery a contingent aspect of modern capitalism, but so was theft. Entire nations of people were displaced through genocide, rape and other forms of violent coercion (Chapter 1 of Zinn's 'A People's History of the United States' is a good starting reader there). Columbus and Cortez,(not to mention Washington and MacDonald a century or two later) enacted the genocide of millions of people simply by virtue of having better weapons, sharper tactics (cause, y'know, the crusades made people pretty hard) and biological warfare. These technologies were all deployed to steal land and resources from sovereign nations. It's like the dark lord Sauron washed up on the isle of Hispaniola and decided to create 'New Mordor'. There is nothing laudable about the processes which built up modern nation states, and the continuing effects of that constitutive violence undermine Liberalism's claims to equality. \n\nLife may not have been perfect for indigenous peoples of the Americas, but we can safely say that a 'peasant' living in Inca or Aztec territory probably had a better quality of life than a European of a similar class. Corn (which btw was created by the agricultural ingenuity of Indigenous south Americans and is still considered the most influential act of bioengineering in human history) made it possible to feed millions of people. Alongside tomatoes, potatoes, squash, and beans of various kinds, there was no need for animal protein. Thus, indigenous south Americans were not exposed to diseases like smallpox, which are a direct result of farming animals. Also, many indigenous cultures operated with a form of democracy (or federational government-like structures) where individual rights were manifest, though they were not articulated with the language of Liberalism. \n\nSpeaking of the contemporary period, very little has changed. Global capitalism still rules the day with an iron fist; neoliberal financial institutions oversee the creation of export-centred economies in poor states which are unable to meet the demands of their populace. The populace, desperate, must migrate to find markets that they can usefully engage in. Temporary foreign worker programs in rich states (like Canada) are happy to take them in, benefit from the economic surplus they create while keeping wages criminally low and barring permanent residency. (Google 'Harsha Walia' for details of this process in the Canadian context). This is barely better than slavery, which also served to keep the price of commodities down for global production. \n\nTL:DR Slavery may have existed before capitalism, but capitalism wouldn't have been born without slavery. Although the tools are slightly different now, the logic of capitalism/modernity remains similar to its terrifyingly evil roots. It is based on the enslavement, alienation and displacement of indigenous peoples from their traditional lands and resources. As such, there is no morally tenable argument in favour of modernity. \n\n\nIn other words, we have a lot to learn from our suppressed past. We already need to change things drastically if we (humans and ecosystems) are going to survive this century. \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: redwhiskeredbubul\n\nResponse A: The problem is that the categories you can use to critique these exploitative institutions are also established by modernity. For example, why is slavery bad? It might seem patently obvious today, but it clearly wasn't obvious to the people practicing chattel slavery until the last quarter of the 19th century. And there were piles of moral and theological justifications offered for it. The reason we recognize it as bad today is because arguments about natural right, and natural equality, arguments made by people like Rousseau, undermined the philosophical basis of slavery. \n\nGenocide is an even clearer example. Genocide wasn't specifically criminalized until after WWII, and this formed a major basis of international human rights law. The rationale behind the idea that Genocide is wrong is not simple or self-evident: for example, it involves the idea that a 'people' can be a self-determining subject _and_ that its relationship with other peoples can be subject to a universal law. This has been a huge topic in philosophy for centuries, arguably since Kant. \n\nIf you pass off the badness of these kinds of practices as simply self-evident, you trivialize the positive institutions that we have to prevent them. This is dangerous because political institutions, unlike, say sclentific facts, ultimately rely on _your_ political will to be just, effective and true. Your stance on them matters enormously. Anti-modern arguments can be used to criticise capitalism, but they can also be used to spread the kinds of nihilism, anomie, and cynicism that creates the conditions for political forms like fascism and totalitarianism. \n\nIn short, you can't give external moral criteria for evaluating whether modernity is good or bad because modernity itself determines those criteria. But if you make an argument from despair because of this, you're sawing off the branch you stand on. \n\nResponse B Author: James_McNulty\n\nResponse B: You will have to define the moral ruler by which we're going to measure 'good vs. evil' in this discussion.  Every example you've given of terrible things being done have pre-modern equivalents.  The problem isn't modernity, it's human nature.\n\n\nAlso the core of the Roman Empire.\n\n\nThis is both partially right, incomplete, and partially bad history.  Columbus and Cortez definitely committed terrible acts and were responsible for future genocide.  However, history is littered with military leaders who killed indiscriminately.  Genghis Khan formed the largest empire in world history behind better weapons, sharper tactics and the occasional mass killing.  You mention the crusades in reference to modern atrocities but don't stop to consider the horrors those campaigns entailed?  Additionally, the biological warfare bit is not really substantiated by much historical evidence.  Yes, smallpox blankets happened, but it wasn't a systematic tactic like you're making it seem.  Basically, Native Americans died en masse because there were a lot of them.  Europeans in America were also dying of disease, but in numbers far smaller because there were millions fewer in total population.\n\n\nExcept that many, many fewer people live in abject poverty.  Many, many more people have access to clean water, enough food, and proper sanitation.  Many, many fewer women and babies die in childbirth, and many, many fewer people die of communicable diseases.  While I'm not defending all aspects of so-called wage-slave capitalism, you cannot make a serious argument that a someone living paycheck to paycheck in Canada is equivalent to African slaves being stacked five high for the Middle Passage.  Throughout nearly the entirety of human existence, almost everyone in the world  would immediately choose \"water, food, clothing, adequate shelter\" over whatever conditions they were living in at the time, if given a choice.\n\nI'm not saying we can't do better, because we can.  But the idea that everyone was civil and treated each other fairly, or that atrocities didn't happen until 1500, is completely misinformed.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author redwhiskeredbubul's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I have not touched TV for at least a year, and when I do it is usually very brief. If I do not have a TV now, I cannot find any excuse to it. I find TV useless when one could afford a computer with decent internet connection. Why? Let me list my reasons.\n\n1. TV alone cannot do everything PC can, and PC can do almost everything TV can. Sure you could watch sport on TV, but you could do the same on internet. Sure you could watch news on TV, but you could watch those same channels on internet, and have other choices such as blogs. Those movie and TV show are available on PC from providers like Netflix, while other extremly popular medias available on computer like YouTube are not available on normal TV. Smart TVs have them, but they cost more than regular TV, and you may as well buy a decent computer.\n\n2. TVs are poor substitute for computer monitor. I could buy a decent 1440p 27 inch PLS monitor like this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA4JH1H16177\n\nOr I could spend similar amount of money for 720p 32 inch TVs like these:\nhttp://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/category/televisions/21344.aspx?type=product&amp;NVID=departments%3BTV+%26+Home+Theatre%3BTelevisions%3Bim%3Bc1%3Br1%3Ben&amp;filter=category%253aTV%2B%2526%2BHome%2BTheatre%253bcategory%253aTelevisions%253bpricerangennn%253a%2524200%2B-%2B%2524299.99\n\nBestBuy may not always be the best place to buy TV, but you still can't get a better monitor replacement with another $100:\nhttp://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/category/televisions/21344.aspx?type=product&amp;NVID=departments%3BTV+%26+Home+Theatre%3BTelevisions%3Bim%3Bc1%3Br1%3Ben&amp;filter=category%253aTV%2B%2526%2BHome%2BTheatre%253bcategory%253aTelevisions%253bpricerangennn%253a%2524300%2B-%2B%2524399.99\n\nOther than that, there are other more technical problems to use TV as monitor replacement, and we could discuss it on request.\n\n3. Gaming quality on computer is at least on par with TV, if not better. I don't want to stir up another war of PC vs Console, but I think it is safe to say PC could provide similar gaming quality at the same cost as console. In addition, PC have more choices such as MMO and upgrade potential. This means people could pay more on PC to get a premium experience, while consoles only offer its potential in a very narrow price range. If a person own a decent TV, there is a good chance that he also own a computer. Buying a decent graphic card as an upgrade is not really more expensive than buying a console, and the TV itself cost separately. Again, I will elaborate on this upon request.\n\n4.TVs are not mobile, while laptops are. Even if they are, things like chromebook defeat their purpose.\n\n5. Computers don't really cost more. If you pay for TV channels, then you could pay for internet. I personally find internet more important than the latter. As well, you get could still get access to those shows with internet. As stated in point 2 and 3, TVs are not really that much cost effective either. What is the point of TV now?\n\nView change: TV is useful for a group of people, and especially in a family with young child.\n\nView change: TV is not in danger of rapid decline in at least a few years.\n\nResponse A Author: Bowbreaker\n\nResponse A: If you were just arguing about TV channels I'd wholeheartedly agree that the trend is going that way, and for good reason.\n\nBut if you argue about the devices themselves I have to disagree. Have you ever tried to have a movie night with 5+ people on a computer? Do you move your desktop computer around for that from office to living room in order to do that? What about big screen action movies you want to see in bed, maybe with the missus/hubby? Running in the background while you're working in the kitchen and yet perfectly visible even from a distance?\n\nHonestly, just look how TVs are becoming larger and larger. Lately they have even created curved TVs for even more width. Do you think people buy those just because they are all mindless consumers?\n\nResponse B Author: EvilNalu\n\nResponse B: Never in CMV have I seen a title that I thought I would totally agree with and a body that I totally disagree with.\n\nYou are setting up some weird false dichotomy between computers with small monitors and TVs. In the future a TV will simply be a computer with a large monitor. I have had dedicated computers hooked up to my TVs for many years now in addition to my desktop hooked up to monitors, my laptop, my tablets and my phone.  I consider these all computers - I have a variety of computers with displays ranging from 4 to 50 inches.\n\nThe distinction (if there ever was any) between TVs and computers is in fact disappearing - most new TVs have some streaming and other computer-like functionality built in.  In the future this trend will only accelerate and soon no one will have a TV incapable of playing YouTube videos, Netflix, and games.\n\nThe model of a large screen in a common room is here to stay. It's a model that makes way more sense for families, for people who have gatherings, for people who watch media with significant others, etc. This encompasses a large percentage of media consumers.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Bowbreaker's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: I don't see any good reason why two (or more) people would bind themselves to this promise of \"til death do us part.\" First of all, obvious point - 50% of marriages end in divorce, so you know there's a good chance it won't work out. But even if you do make it work - at what cost, to your and your partner's happiness? I think that if you really do love each other, you will stick together for as long as that holds true, marriage or not. Marriage is a way of saying \"even if we start to absolutely hate each others guts, we're bound to each other like it or not.\" Why would you subject yourself to that potential torment? If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be - let each other go. And are you so afraid that your partner will stop loving you and leave you for someone else, that you have to handcuff them to you with marriage? If your love for your partner is anything more than purely selfish, you should want your partner to be happy. So you should let them go if their happiness requires it. If the relationship goes sour, you should just be able to say \"okay we're done. Peace out.\" But if you're married, then you have to go through the whole messy divorce problem, after \"trying to make it work\" with marriage counseling for who knows how many years. Essentially, by getting married you earn yourself no advantages in your relationship, but you put yourself at risk for some serious unhappiness. I understand there may be certain legal benefits, but lets leave that aside, since no one cites tax write-offs as their primary reason for getting married. \n\nMore generally, I believe that this romantic ideal of two people faithfully monogamous to each other for the rest of their lives is just pure Disney, and it's causing more harm than good. So a lot of my criticism of marriage applies to monogamous relationships in general. We will continue to suffer from relationships - either staying in unhappy ones, or being devastated when a partner leaves or cheats on us - until we accept that both partners are free and independent human beings, and a good relationship is one that is enthusiastically engaged in on both sides. If for whatever reason one partner is unhappy with the relationship, then they should be free to leave it without any shame or guilt. They shouldn't feel like they have to hide their feelings, or go behind their partner's back and cheat on them. I think it's perfectly natural for a relationship to have its time, and run its course. By letting go of a bad relationship, you open yourself up to a better one. \n\nResponse A Author: mogifax\n\nResponse A: A married dude here, 10+ years.\n\nMake no mistake about it, marriage is tough.  Sometimes it's hair-tearingly frustrating.  But once you find your groove and learn how to maintain it, it's an awesome arrangement.\n\nIf both of you are roughly on the same page in terms of life priorities, you'll be accomplishing twice as much stuff.  Double the money, twice the chores, twice the fun.  You'll have a built-in audience for your frustrations and triumphs.  You'll hopefully develop deep trust and respect for each other and learn your collective strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI know that it all comes down to \"*why the piece of paper, then?*\"  Well, it's like living in a good neighborhood and arguing that you don't need door locks.  Why bother?  There's never any break-ins or robberies.  Or driving without a seat belt in a car without air bags -- why bother?  You're a good driver.\n\nUntil a fly-by-night hobo robs you, or a drunk teenager t-bones you at an intersection.\n\nWe humans love rituals.  They put us at peace, give us a sense of direction and finality, put our commitments on display.  Going through the process of getting marries is one of those rituals.  You're saying to each other, \"*I am committing my life to you, and here's a little proof*\".  Think about how much value we place on displays of commitment - from tattoos to uniforms, from car decals to membership-based clothing styles, most things we do in life are parts of specific frameworks within which we operate.\n\nIf both of you want kids, not being married is irresponsible, even if from the legal perspective alone.  Even if at the macro level there was no societal concept of marriage, how would you figure out who carries what weight in raising a child if there's a long string of temporary boyfriends/girlfriends?  It's just impractical.\n\nIn the end, to each is own.  I know plenty of unmarried people, and they are happy.  However, to me their relationships always seem incomplete.  They are like characters in an MMORPG that are half a level shy of level cap, and they purposefully shut off leveling because they don't believe in endgame raiding.  Well, not believing in it doesn't mean it's not there.  Every single night there are committed people logging in to kill internet dragons TOGETHER.\n\nResponse B Author: funchy\n\nResponse B: I don't see how it could be a festive if both people consenting adults who knowingly enter into the agreement? Nobody's being pressured, tricked, or misinformed. It does not automatically mean one person suffer while the other gains great benefit.  If you personally don't feel ready for interested in marriage, nobody should be pushing you to get one. Conversely those who get one get it because they want it.\n\nSome people get married and stay happily married the rest of their life. Part of it is the outlook they have. Part of it is they appreciate their partner and the blessing of the marriage, rather than feeling trapped or oppressed.   If you can be happy around your partner each day, you're not going to want a divorce. Maybe the flaw in our society isn't marriage but rather the bad cultural values that cause some people to give up on their marriages.  And isn't possible those bad cultural values also cause non married partners to break up as well?  \n\nI think if you look at some cultural groups, you find a very low divorce rate , except in cases of outright abuse. They have different expectations going into the marriage. The marriage and kids is not all about them. Sometimes the roles are better defined. Sometimes their culture offers more of a support system for the spouse, such as extended family.  Within those cultures, respect for other people and or respect for the opposite sex maybe more heavily emphasized . And not all cultures view sex quite so selfishly, ie there's more to sex than pleasing oneself.  I don't think any these traits mean a person is stuck with out of date impractical values. It's just that the common American way of looking at marriage may not be as healthy for overall happy long term relationships as it could be.\n\n\nSo instead of trying to do away with marriage, I propose that we try to do away with the beliefs and behaviors that are correlated with those that can't maintain long-term relationships.  marriage or not, people with those values will still be miserable even know there's not a marriage contract joining them to their partner.

However, I believe these are offset and outnumbered by the tyranny and atrocities committed under non-democratic governments.\n\nWhen I say this I mean that I believe comparing modern and past democracies to modern and past dictatorships and monarchies throughout history will yield the conclusion that the quality of life in a democracy is substantially better for most people and that as more people are given franchise the better and better it gets.  Conversely if, for example, the U.S. had been a one-party dictatorship for the past 200+ years, atrocities such as chattel slavery, genocide of indigenous peoples, and unwarranted global intervention would be that much worse (if imagining such is even possible.)\n\nI want to clarify that I am using the U.S. as my main example because that's where I am, also I think it is a good example of a particularly controversial example of democracy.\n\nI believe that one of the biggest problems with American democracy to date is the ambivelence people have towards democracy.  Judging even just from the posts on this sub many are incredibly disappointed with democracy and will even go as far as to say it is \"obsolete\" or just a bad idea in the first place.  When we stop having faith in democracy we stop having faith in the people and ourselves and necessarily cede our power to others.  \n\nChange my view!\n\n\nOk there have been a lot of requests for me to pin things down better and define my view, I'd say it has changed a little since I first posted but here it is:\n\nDemocracy is any form of government concerned with the idea of giving more people say, more people equality, more people freedom. \n\nSo for example, the U.S. falls short of these things in many ways and at many times but at least it is founded on the premise of expanding the categories that receive citizenship.\n\nAt the founding of the U.S. citizenship was incredibly limited but it was still a far larger category of participants than european monarchy.\n\nSo Democracy is dynamic and you can have moments in the same system/government/culture that are democratic and un-democratic.  \n\nMy belief is the idea that the moments that best represent the will of the people are best for governance overall.\n\n\nOk so far thank you all for a some interesting debates.  This is my first time as OP on CMV so please forgive my amateurish blunders.  After some contemplation and review I have come to the conclusion that my prompt is too ambiguous, that in order to have a fruitful CMV I need to choose specifically what I am defending.  If that is representative democracy, then so be it.\n\nI may have pulled a bit too much of a \"No true Scotsman\" here.\n\n\nResponse A Author: zincpl\n\nResponse A: I want to argue that democracy is not always the best choice in every situation, in particular the number of times where a democracy fails is very large. In established states or states with little internal tensions democracy functions well - however in highly heterogenous and divided states or states with strong foreign interests it fails:\nin recent times:\nlibya\negypt\niraq\nafghanistan\nzimbabwe\nukraine\nthailand\n\nhistorically you can consider:\nthe weimar republic\nany of the french republics in the first 70 years after the revolution\nthe first polish republic\n\na badly set up democracy is often worse than a good dictatorship, and arguably Franco and Pinochet were better off for their countries at the time than the free choice of the people . Likewise right now in Syria a democracy could well entrench IS.\n\nSo basically while I think a well-planned democracy is most often the best, sometimes stability is a better option and often a poorly constructed democracy is worse than the alternatives.\n\nResponse B Author: Minitone\n\nResponse B: I would remind you that the purest form of \"democracy\" is anarchy, or complete absence of government. Anarchy is what happens when you give everyone maximum freedom and you give everyone an equal say. What do you get in anarchy? Mainly the strong overpowering the weak.\n\nA purely democratic government (where everything is decided by popular vote) would be almost the same. Instead of the strong overpowering the weak, you have the more numerous overpowering the less numerous. In case you think this would be a good idea, look at some of the great ideas majorities in America have had in the past: racial segregation, eugenics, pure isolationism, etc...\n\nA purely democratic government is also prone to error because the majority is not qualified to determine what's in the best interests of all people, as the government should do. People are naturally only concerned with protecting their own interests; hence, anarchy causes chaos. The job of the government is to **restrict people's freedom** to a point where they cannot infringe on others' freedom.

Like, completely relative.\n\nOp: \nLet me preface this by saying that I'm not okay with raping babies. However, the idea of moral relativity, and the question, \"How far can we take it?\" are troubling ones. I've done some careful thinking and I believe that there are no objective morals at all. I'm interested in hearing what others think of my case, and equally interested in hearing theirs.\n\nBasically, my case for complete moral relativity is this:\n\n* Human perception of morality varies wildly based on time, place, situation, and who you ask. For example, many of the moral guidelines described in religious texts would be completely unacceptable today, but back then they were the norm. We don't consider people from those eras of those religions \"evil,\" even if we do say they are misguided. Therefore, it follows that morality must depend on context.\n\n* As another example, I once had a very heated argument with a religious friend who claimed that cannibalism was objectively wrong. It is disrespectful to the dead. However, some cultures consider eating your dead a way of showing respect. It does not seem fair to call these people \"evil\" for doing what their culture does. In addition, if a person's survival depends on cannibalism, it does not seem fair to call them evil to prioritize their own life over the sanctity of a corpse. Therefore, even things that \"feel\" wrong to us, like eating human flesh, cannot be.\n\n* Humans do not agree on moral issues. Euthanasia, abortion, and war are controversial issues. If morality were objective, we would all agree on these issues.\n\n* Legality is a human construct, and is an attempt to enforce objective morality onto a relatively moral world. This is why the law is not always right. For example, criminals can sometimes get away with their actions by finding a loophole, and innocent people can be punished for breaking the law, even when it seems obvious that their actions were not immoral and did not present any significant danger to anyone. Therefore, objective morality cannot work in the real world.\n\n* Human morality often reflects evolution. (And evolution can be used to explain certain \"objective\" morals) We intuitively value altruism because it is good for the population. We despise child abuse because we have an instinctive urge to protect our young. Most, if not all, of the things we consider \"objectively wrong\" are things that are harmful, to the individual or to the whole. It's probable, therefore, that a different civilization evolved in different conditions would not follow our objective morality. We cannot safely consider them \"evil,\" so we must conclude that even if their morality is completely different from ours, they are still just as morally correct.\n\n* To use an example from popular culture, the Formics from Ender's Game possess no free will on an individual level, and do not consider killing morally wrong. Humans hold free will and agency in high regard, yet the Formics do not, and even a seemingly objective moral rule, \"Don't kill people,\" is not universal. However, as the author demonstrates, this does not make them evil. It just means that finding common morals is very difficult, if possible at all.\n\nFrom this case, it seems that the only possible moral code is that there isn't one; Morality is determined by those it concerns. Child abuse, rape, murder, stealing, these things are wrong *because we consider them wrong*, and because they are harmful to us. Objective morality of any kind cannot exist.\n\nThis is not to say that I believe serial killers are just as moral as saints. It is clear that morals are necessary to the structure of society. We still must stop criminals who are harmful to society, even if we are unclear on the most moral way to go about doing so. We still must have moral standards, to help individuals get along with each other and keep humans happy. However, we have to accept that objective morality is inherently flawed.\n\n\nMorality cannot be thought of as strictly objective or relative. Instead, there are certain things that almost all humans can agree are immoral, such as murder and rape, so they are objectively wrong. These are usually defined by what is beneficial to humanity's survival. On the other hand, there are some things that are, at least at the moment, impossible to objectively determine as right or wrong, and for these we have to rely on personal experience and careful reflection until we have a better way of deciding.\n\nSo I have changed my view a little, and I'm working on refining this into something a little clearer. Thank you guys for your input.\n\n\nResponse A Author: sguntun\n\nResponse A: All of the reasons you've offered to doubt moral realism (the thesis that there are mind-independent moral facts) are pretty weak. One by one:\n\n\nBut this is true of non-moral matters as well. Humans used to think that the sun revolved around the Earth, and now we think that the Earth revolves around the sun. But this doesn't mean that there's no fact of the matter about astronomy. So the fact that moral beliefs change can't be evidence to think that there's no fact of the matter of morality.\n\n\nWell, there a couple of different responses the committed moral realist might offer here. First, we might say that one of these groups is simply wrong: maybe religions that think cannibalism is wrong are mistaken, or maybe cultures that practice cannibalism are mistaken. This isn't a very appealing response, though. A more promising response is to say that respecting the dead is a moral imperative. Which actions count as respectful toward the dead might vary by culture, but this doesn't mean that what's right and wrong actually varies by culture.\n\n\nBut again, humans disagree about all sorts of issues. For instance, there's disagreement about which interpretation of quantum physics is correct, but that doesn't seem to suggest that there's no fact of the matter about which interpretation is correct. In fact, disagreement is a pretty good indicator that there is a fact of the matter--otherwise, what could the disagreement even be about?\n\nMoreover, there are at least some moral issues that face widespread agreement. Pretty much everyone agrees, I take it, that it's wrong to set babies on fire for fun. There are controversial moral questions, but I don't think most moral questions are controversial.\n\n\nThis reasoning seems very confused to me. You conclude that \"objective morality cannot work in the real world,\" but objective morality isn't supposed to \"work.\" The thesis that there exist mind-independent moral facts isn't a plan of action that can succeed or fail to succeed. If I say that objective morality exists, I haven't said anything about whether or not people act in the morally correct way. And moreover, if you believe that \"the law is not always right,\" it looks like you *have* to believe that there are objective moral facts, because there has to be a standard that the law fails to meet when it goes wrong.\n\n\nSure, but there are lots of counterexamples too. For instance, most people agree that racism is morally wrong, but there are evolutionary benefits to racism. Rape is also evolutionarily beneficial under some circumstances, but we're still pretty convinced that rape is wrong. So it's not like our moral beliefs are slaves to our evolutionary origins. That may be the origin of many of our moral beliefs, but we're pretty good at reasoning, and we've abandoned some of the ones we decided were wrong.\n\nResponse B Author: GnosticGnome\n\nResponse B: \nSo does physics.\n\n\nDepends, but sometimes we do.  Whether or not we say they are evil has nothing to do with whether they are actually evil, of course.\n\n\nTo go back to the physics example, we wouldn't call people whose culture has a different physics model \"stupid\", even if they are incorrect.  That said, it's quite possible that the real moral answer is \"It is moral to show respect to the dead, immoral to show disrespect to the dead, but what constitutes respect is culturally based\".  \n\n\nHumans do not agree on physics or even math.  Global warming, string theory, and even the Monty Hall problem are all controversial issues.  Math clearly shows that there is one answer to the Monty Hall problem, but even mathematicians don't actually all agree on it.  Math and science can be objective without people agreeing on these issues.\n\n\nSure, but this is a criticism of laws and not morality.\n\n\nWell, it can't be translated perfectly into law, but that's different from not working.  Math can't be translated perfectly into a computer program, but math still works in the real world.\n\n\nThis is a \"just so story\" and is not actually justified by data.  Your specific examples here are likely incorrect (see The Selfish Gene for why they're problematic), but even if you picked more accurate examples, we still don't have any real evidence to show which attitudes are evolved and which aren't.  Let alone what benefits are \"responsible\" for the direction evolution has taken.\n\n\nThere's certainly no shortage of disagreement on ethics, math, or any other subject.\n\n\nNot demonstrates.  Claims. \n\n\nDoesn't the fact that this is clear serve as evidence that some moral systems are actually better than others?  Can't we say that some moral standards/rules are more likely to be correct (or are correct in much more/broader situations) than others?\n\n\n\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author sguntun's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

This doesn't have the nice symmetry property like the theft example that discourages people from from choosing to follow ridiculous laws.\n\nThe *huge* majority of laws do not govern symmetric interactions between individuals and this sort of system has no way of handling these kinds of laws.

When you're saying you choose your sexuality, you're referring to choosing who you are sexually active with, right? You phrase it as 'the sexuality you ended up living', so I don't think I'm misinterpreting your idea of sexuality.\n\nWhen referring to sexuality, most people are referring to the sex and/or gender of the people you are interested in, not who you end up having sex with. That's why most people wouldn't say that all celibate individuals are of an asexual orientation. They're just not having sex with anyone. Similarly, can a virgin not have an orientation?\n\nWhile some celibate individuals (or virgins) may certainly be asexual, it's rather likely they are still sexually attracted to certain individuals but simply are not acting on it. It is then the case that their sexual orientation and their sexual behavior do not match. Both of these are an aspect of sexuality and impact what sexuality we identify with, but when we refer to sexuality, we're mainly talking about orientation and not behavior.\n\nSo what I'm saying is, you're not necessarily wrong and I don't completely disagree.

In this thread, I'll defend the tenability of a position on the mind-body problem called dualism. I would like the main emphasis in this thread to be on the debate between dualism and materialism, although other theories of mind like panpsychism are welcome as well.\n\nDualism is the position that the mind is immaterial. There are two main kinds of dualism:\n\n1. Substance dualism - This is the position that the mind is an immaterial thing distinct from the brain. This position is defended primarily by religious philosophers and has generally fallen out of favor in contemporary philosophy. Descartes is the philosopher most associated with this position, but it has modern defenders like Richard Swinburne.\n\n2. Property dualism - This is the position that the mind is an immaterial property of the brain. This position is much more popular than substance dualism and is defended by secular philosophers like David Chalmers. (I think property dualism is more tenable than substance dualism.)\n\nThe most widely held competitor to dualism is materialism, which holds that the mind is material. There are a number of forms of materialism as well, ranging from the unsophisticated identity theory (mental states are identical to physical processes in the brain) to the more fashionable functionalism (mental states are identical to the functional roles of brain states in the system of brain states). Perhaps the most prominent defender of functionalism is Daniel Dennett.\n\nI think that dualism is a tenable position in philosophy of mind - in other words, there is nothing obviously irrational about it, there are arguments for it that don't make any clear blunders, and a reasonable person could arrive at this conclusion. This is a very modest claim that I suspect even most materialist philosophers would accept.\n\nI think there are two arguments that make it reasonable to be a dualist.\n\nMy first argument for dualism is that we have qualia. Qualia are subjective, private, first person experiences; they are \"what it is like\" to be in a certain state. If I look at a white wall in my room, there are photons registering in my eyes and chemical events going on in my brain, but there is also something it is like to be looking at the white wall, a white quale.\n\nIt is difficult to see how the qualia in my example could be identical to the chemical events going on in my brain, because we can always ask why any given chemical process is accompanied by qualia. To give another example, stimulation of the C-fibers is always accompanied by pain qualia, but it seems reasonable enough to ask why stimulation of the C-fibers has to be accompanied by qualia. I do not mean to imply that these questions have no answers. I am just saying that the fact that it is reasonable to ask them suggests that qualia are not literally identical to any physical event.\n\nChalmers brings this point out by means of his zombie thought experiment in his book *The Conscious Mind*. We can conceive of a world exactly like ours in every physical respect, but in which no one has any conscious experience (i.e., any qualia). Since we can conceive of a zombie world, it must be possible, and if it is possible, then qualia are not identical to physical processes.\n\nChalmers uses other thought experiments in his book as well. For example, we can conceive of someone who had exactly the same physical makeup as we do having inverted qualia (where we have a red quale, they have a green quale, etc.). This suggests, again, that qualia are not identical to physical events.\n\nMy second argument for dualism is that the mind has properties that a physical process cannot have, and physical processes have properties that the mind cannot have. A thought can be apt or witty, but a chemical process cannot. Again, a physical process can have a temperature or velocity, but a thought cannot. This suggests strongly that the mind is not a physical process.\n\nSo I think it's clear that dualism is a tenable position that a reasonable person could hold. I don't claim to know that it is true, but it deserves more respect than it often gets on Reddit and elsewhere on the internet. \n\nTo change my view about this, you will have to satisfactorily refute my arguments (not just brush them off as materialists are wont to do).\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: drsteelhammer\n\nResponse A: \nFirstly, a mere thought is not witty, we might consider it a witty thought but \"witty\" is not adjective that can be given to the thought itself. But, more importantly, your second sentence does not make sense. A light wave has no mass either and probably no temperature (although I am not sure about that), but it is still \"physical\".\n\nResponse B Author: disembodiedbrain\n\nResponse B: How does the physical affect the non-physical, and visa-versa, in substance dualism?\n\nI don't think property dualism contradicts materialism.\n\n\nThere are physical processes that don't have temperature or velocity. Similarly, there are physical processes that cannot be apt or witty. That doesn't imply that things which are witty and apt are not physical.\n\n\nYou're making the same mistake as Descartes.

CMV\n\nOp: I was on r/Christianity when I got into a debate on 'dying for ones beliefs'. An individual was defending his religious viewpoint by declaring that he is willing to die for his God. He then asked me what I was willing to sacrifice my life for and honestly, I cant rationally think of a single thing or person I would be willing to take a bullet for. This got me thinking that I don't think there is anything worth dying for. \n\nTheology aside is there an existential cause or something tangible that you REALLY would die for.\n\nI'm asking this in all seriousness, my knee jerk reaction when first confronted with this question was to say my Mother but that's too obvious and I would only be doing it in a reactionary way, like pushing her away from an on coming train or something. That is something I imagine we all would do. \n\nWhat I'm asking is; if you actually had to sit down and think of things you would SACRIFICE your life for could you come up with anything? Is there anything universal worth dying for? Please tell me the reasoning behind your decision.\n\nAn even more compelling and thought provoking argument came when someone posted that children are a way of ensuring ones immortality. In a way the sacrifice of your life for that of your child is like rising above death. That is a very interesting way to view life.\n\n\nResponse A Author: Unshocked\n\nResponse A: Everything in your life has a specific value to you (not to be confused with the value that society puts on things). Your belongings, your family, etc. You also put a value on the theoretical remaining life you have (since you don't know exactly when you will pass away). These values are ordinal. (no specific numeric value but maintains a ranking system)\n\nAs you get older, the value you place on the theoretical remaining life you have will get lower with respect to other things in your life such as children (it's value might not change but other values will increase thereby making it's rank lower). As soon as something in your life is threaten, you try and sacrifice other things starting from the ones worth the least value to you, and ending at the ones worth most to you. If the threat is big enough and your at a point in your life where your self value is less then or equal to the value of what is being threaten you will make the trade. Obviously there is no guarantee that you will ever reach this point in your life because your self value might be so much greater that nothing will every reach it.\n\nTo answer your last questions, for a lot of people there are things that are worth dieing for, or will eventually be worth dieing for. There probably isn't anything universal but there will be things that a lot of people have in common such as parents, siblings and children because the value people put on their value is normally high.\n\nResponse B Author: davq\n\nResponse B: Interesting question!  One could try to be purely rational - maybe I should sacrifice myself to save this doctor since he will save many more lives - but I don't think that will sway many since our own lives are typically more subjectively valuable to us.  So we're probably not going to find anything universal.  \n\nFinding something worth dying for requires 1. a particularly high value on someone/something else (e.g. your kids, spouse, best friend, etc.), and/or 2. decrease your subjective value of your own life until something is higher.  That sounds negative, but doesn't have to be - we tend to forget that we're going to die someday anyhow, and having a good (meaningful) death is something many value.  \n\nIs there anything hypothetical you can think of that would be worth it?  Maybe something ridiculously extreme like sacrificing yourself to permanently thwart an alien invasion that was going to torture all of humanity (yourself included) forever.  Or a contract with a genie that with your death all human disease will instantly be cured.  If you can think of a hypothetical, then see how far you can pull that toward reality (I would die to save 100 lives) and you may find something.\n\nMany replies seem to focus the willingness to *risk* death (e.g. fight for) something rather than the willingness to die for it.  For me, if death were 100% guaranteed, and not reflexive decision, I can still confidently say I would die for any of my family and friends, and pretty much any child.  There are also circumstances in which I would die for my religion (Christian) and moral values.  I like to think I would die to save another random person's life, but it's hard to be as confident on that.  Believing that death is not the end does tend to lower one's aversion to death.  On the other hand, being married means my death would deeply hurt my wife, so that raises the value of living.\n\nI hope someday you will have people in your life who are worth dying for.

PLEASE CMV!\n\nOp: Greetings\n\nI am an environmental engineer, with a degree in environment and land management. I have studied and dedicated my professional life to make a change on our world, to make this planet a better place for future generations and protect it from those that would exploit it for greed and short term gain.\n\nAfter 15 years of working in the field I am ready to give up. The fact is most people don't give a shit about our planet and the legacy we are leaving for future generations. I have worked hard, sometimes more than 70 hours a week, to see all that I have accomplished destroyed by short sighted corporations and the uncaring government that work for them.\n\nI have been called a useless hippy who works only to stifle profits, I have seen the depths of which government and corporations will go to fuck us all for short term gains and I have lived for many years barely breaking even and financially keeping myself afloat because most environmental jobs that aren't about exploiting the system to maximize a companies profits pays for shit.\n\nWell now I have a wife, a son, banks who are hounding me night and day to pay back my student loans and the dream of offering a better life for my family. This week I have been offered two new career opportunity. One is to manage a non profit organisation dedicated to protecting the last vestiges of forests and wetlands around the city i live in (while paying only 13$/h). The other is for a big construction company, to make sure that it is compliant with the pathetic environmental regulations while it bulldozes over the last natural ecosystems we have (but for more money per month than I ever made in a year)\n\nI am to give my decision next week and I am truly considering for the first time in my life to give up my principals and go work for the money. I need somebody to change my views, but I am so tired of living poor, of not being respected and of seeing all my work be for nothing.\n\n\nFinal decision Edit: First I would like to thank you all for this awesome CMV. It went way beyond what I had ever expected and I don't think I have ever spent so much time typing since my time at university. Like I said in the previous edit, I had already reached a decision by consulting my wife, my friends and my family, but all the incredible advice and the insightful comment gave me great hope that my decision will be the right one for my career, myself and my family. So here it goes\n\nI have decided to take the construction industry job for the following reasons:\n\n- Right now it is an awful time to be working in the non-profit NGO, where I live. The conservative government has slashed all funding in the environment sector and the provincial government only cares about austerity. If I took the NGO job, I wouldn't even be guarantied to be able to keep it for very long if the meager funding dries out.\n\n- I have been working in the same field, with the same people for over 15 years. I am feel enthusiastic about learning new things and working with new people. Also if I learn the inner workings of the construction industry, I may become much more efficient to enact long term meaningful changes.\n\n- I have been living poor (well much more then most engineer do) for the past 15 and I still have some student loans to reimburse. Banks have constantly been picking at my heels and it will be quite a load of my stress, if I can finally repay then and make then STFU! Also having some form of financial stability would be great for a change.\n\n- Although where I live, our society has quite the safety net and I am assured that my child will never lack of his basic needs whatever salary I make, It would be great to offer my family a better quality of life. Rest assured I am not someone who will have more money go to his head. By nature, I am not a great consumer and I am very likely to put most of my money aside for personal projects and even help out the NGO I had worked for and respect.\n\n- I have dedicated my entire life to fight for the environment and that in not about to change, even if I work in a different field. Over the years I have found that enacting change from the outside of a system is next to impossible, so it will be quite interesting to see if change can be had from the inside. \n\n- My greatest fear is that the construction job asks me to compromise to much on my value and that makes me fall into a depression. In order to prevent this scenario, I will be following the advice given by many of you. Quickly put money aside, so I can safely bail out if thing get to rough and have multiple contingency plan if ever it does. \n\n- Finally I must admit that the money does sound attractive. I never had a job that pays so much and I never thought I would. However having grown in a wealthy (relatively speaking) family, I know first hand that money doesn't buy happiness, it just makes misery very comfortable. Since I am a woodsman and love working outdoors comforts aren't that important to me, but it's been forever since I have dreamed of visiting the different forests around the world and for the first time in my life, I may actually be able to do that (If I ever get some vacation time... a concept that is equally alien to me) \n\nOnce again many thanks to all the people who commented on my CMV post (yes even the trolls, their idiotic antics proved somewhat entertaining) I wish you all the very best of luck in your endeavours and if anyone wants to help me in my quest to make this world a better place, feel free to go out an plant a tree. In the long run it does actually make a difference.

It also lists some good resources for evaluating non-profits.\n\nI found it to be a bit of a coincidence to have read that yesterday and see this dilemma today.  Best of luck! You're in a tough spot.\n\nResponse B Author: idislikekittens\n\nResponse B: I'm going to try to give you something to think about. \n\nWere you once an idealistic college kid? That's what made you get into environmentalism, most likely, right? Of course you know yourself better than anyone else, but get yourself away from the rational adult for a bit. Go find an environmental branch in your local university and talk to the students. See if you can still see yourself in them. There is nothing shameful about emotions. They make us human and they make us alive. \n\nNo one can fault you for that decision, but ask yourself: can you really change the system from the inside? I really don't think you can. You've witnessed exactly how fucked up the situation is, and I don't think it'll be easier trying to change it when your livelihood is actually on the line. You'll only make a difference if you get to the very top of your bracket, but even that would be you trying to get changes to trickle down. Most importantly, you'll always be working from a place of guilt in order to compensate for something. Is it worth it? Probably not, if you're single and childless. But you aren't. This is something you need to discuss with your wife. If she has a job that can supplement the $13 an hour and keep you both relatively comfortable, then great. If not, then you'll need to think more about it. \n\nI'm really sorry that you have to make this decision. My mom is a social worker and she doesn't get paid nearly enough for all the shit she deals with. I'm lucky that we're poor enough for me to get a full ride at a good university, but your post convinced me that I can't waste this luck.

You don't choose to be born a male, so it's not fair that you're labeled as a potential rapist with examples like the \"bowl of M&amp;M's\": If I were to use that example, except having the bowl of M&amp;M's be representative of black people, I would be (rightly) called a Neo-Nazi and told to go fuck a Confederate flag or something.\n\nHowever, I see the \"All women live in fear of being raped\" being passed around a lot, and I don't quite see the rationale behind it. Considering that only a minority of men rape, it seems pretty unfair to make a statement that holds all men accountable.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: PepperoniFire\n\nResponse A: \nIt's what we teach them.  If white people live in constant fear of black people committing crimes, it's making erroneous normative assumptions based on race.  In other words, that all black people are inclined towards criminality.\n\nNow, if we treated rape the same way, you'd be right that there's some equivalence between the two statements, but we don't treat it the same way.  We teach women to be on their guard.  We encourage them to take self defense; to watch their drink; to go out in groups; to park in lit parking lots; to dress a certain way; to check the backseat of their car before getting in; to hold their keys 'wolverine style; and we show them 'how not to get raped' videos in health class (they're not called that but they're showed predominantly to girls and focus primarily on protective measures to avoid being 'taken advantage of' more than simply getting mugged on the street.)\n\nSo, yeah, most women live in fear of getting raped because we raise them to be fearful of it.  We put the onus on them to avoid getting raped, and we frame it in a way where it's peculiar to women and men are their assailants.\n\nNo, these aren't right, but they're wrong for different reasons.  There's absolutely socialization of white people to make those wrong assumptions about black people, but it's not something that's deliberately institutionalized anymore or even encouraged about it.  At the very least, we don't usher white people into classrooms and, for example, make sure they are acutely aware of what can happen if they walk into the 'wrong neighborhood.'  In contrast, we do formally introduce young girls and, eventually, women to broad protective measures to ensure they minimize the likelihood of getting raped, even in the most tenuous of ways (e.g., don't dress this way.)\n\nAnd yes, some of it speaks to basic prudence and risk-minimization (such as traveling in groups), but we don't bombard young men with this advice on a regular basis once they hit 12 or 13 years old.  They're presumptively non-victims who can care for themselves.  If you raise people to believe this crime is something to be perpetrated exclusively against them, and thus they should take a very active part in remaining aware of the dangers surrounding them just walking down the street, they will absolutely have a heightened sense of that risk.\n\nResponse B Author: themcos\n\nResponse B: \nCould you elaborate on the intuition you're referring to here? Because as stated, there's no logical connection or implication between the first and second clause of each statement. The first clause of each statement is uncontroversial (I hope), so you're basically comparing the statement \"all white people live in fear of crime\" and \"all women live in fear of being raped\". And while I would quibble over the use of absolutes like \"all\" in either case, there's really nothing linking the accuracy of these two statements. Its *logically* plausible that either, neither or both could be true. Do white people live in fear of crime? I dunno, lets take a poll of white people. Do women live in fear of being raped? I dunno, lets take a poll of women. But there's no overarching principle here that requires someone who accepts/rejects one to have the same belief on the other.\n\n\nAnd I think this clears things up. Where in the statement \"not all man rape, but all women live in fear of being raped\" do you see men being \"held accountable\" or even blamed for anything? The only sense in which you're being \"labeled a potential rapist\" is that if you get on an elevator with a woman in a parking garage at night, she knows *literally* nothing about you, and may very well be wary of you. She's not looking at you with scorn because she suspects you of being a rapist. She's just being cautious.

Compared to Western nations, health and safety regulations are almost non-existent. On top of all of this, the government of China is an oppressive, fascist, Communist regime.\n\nIf Americans are going to casually perform the despicable, unpatriotic, anti-democratic act of supporting the economy of such a Communist state and the international corporations which are allowed to exploit the workers there, they should at least be constantly reminded that this is what they are doing. Obviously, companies selling Chinese-made goods will not volunteer to move to such accurate labeling on their own, so the government should mandate that they do so.\n\nChange my view!\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: coho18\n\nResponse A: If the U.S. had labelled South Korean-made goods as \"products of the exploited workers of a military dictatorship\", the country would not be enjoying its prosperity today. I would think that that label would cause a lot more economic and social damage than the provision of factory jobs at market prices.\n\nAll countries in the Asia-Pacific region went through a period where times were tough; South Korea was a sweatshop state that benefited from an export-oriented economy, until they were able to develop their infrastructure and become a powerhouse in technology. \n\nSo if you're concerned that the U.S. is exploited poor workers, remember that the West is also developing the nation's physical, intellectual, and human capital as well via foreign direct investment (e.g. Korea, Japan, Singapore, etc.). As proof, China's wages have been growing by double digits.\n\nAnd FYI China hasn't been communist since Mao as the nation has private property rights, labour mobility, and income diversity. There are pockets of China that are more capitalist than the U.S.\n\nResponse B Author: LostThineGame\n\nResponse B: Would you also stamp every US army uniform with \"Made by the Exploited Prison Workers (Slaves?) of the United States\" rather than simply \"Made in the USA\"?  Prisoners regularly make under $1/h, receive no health and safety protection, no vacation days or overtime pay, and receive no union protection. \n\nAddressing your main point, I think it's a bit unfair to criticise China too much regarding their factory workers. All the western nations went through the same phase of development with equally poor conditions. It comes across as a bit high and mighty to chastise an economy transitioning through this economic phase when you yourself exploited your own workers to get through it. Heck, the West is pretty much built on the exploitation of other countries workers and slaves. I don't think there's much of a moral high ground for us to take.

He has one concept guiding his entire morality: If you are poor or a criminal, you are always wrong, in every situation and can never redeem yourself. Throughout the entire book/play/movie, he continually bases his decisions on this idea despite plenty of evidence to the contrary. There is no character growth, no development. He is so rigid that when he cannot bear the cognitive dissonance any longer, seeing that Valjean is actually a good man, he kills himself! And this from a guy who himself was born in a prison and raised himself up to become a man of law- his own story seemingly dismantling his own morality. The. Most. Static. Character. Ever.\n\nCMV!\n\n\nResponse A Author: intangiblemango\n\nResponse A: *This is a day-old post, but I hope you still read my response. Caveat: I have not read the original, so I am speaking within the context of the musical version of Les Mis.* \n\nI think Javert's relatively static nature makes him more compelling, not less. If he was wobbly on his convictions from the start, his ultimate change would be comparatively meaningless. One of the lines that has consistently stuck with me is upon Fantine's arrest: \"I have heard such protestations every day for twenty years; Let's have no more explanations. Save your breath and save your tears.\" The reason I like it so much is because he HAS heard such protestations every day for 20 years. Every day. Literally every day he hears some variation of, \"Well, it's not my fault *because*\u2026\" or \"Oh, I have it so hard in life *and so*\u2026\"\n\nWhen you hear so many excuses and lies to justify truly atrocious behavior, it becomes so difficult to pull apart the genuine problems. \n\nWe follow Fantine and Valjean, so we know that they are good people who were in a shitty position. Javert does not know that. He does not have the benefit of the knowledge that the audience has. \n\nI work with CPS on a regular basis and I see the same phenomenon in the investigators there. If you regularly work with people who are the absolute scum of the earth; who beat their children until all their ribs are broken or go on meth binges and forget to feed a toddler for days\u2026 it becomes increasingly difficult to identify the people who have been dealt a bad hand and have made bad decisions but who have the potential to do well if given the right resources. That's hard as hell to do, and it's natural to harden your heart at some point in the process because that's the only way to get by... Otherwise you are in a perpetual state of heartbreak. \n\nThis is where Javert is at the beginning of the play: inoculated. We know, as an audience, that his philosophy is flawed because we have these hard-working people in front of us who we see are just trying to survive. If Javert assumes that of everyone, he will get steamrolled. \n\nRemember, to Javert, Valjean is someone who breaks into houses, refuses to cooperate, and repeatedly runs away from his societal obligation by attempting to escape from prison and then by breaking parole. To Javert, Fantine is a prostitute who brutally attacked someone. *We* know that there was valid reason for their behavior, even if they were bad choices. All Javert has is the evidence. He sees someone who has just been savagely attacked and says, \"Oh, this prostitute did it\" and she says, \"Yeah, I did it, but you shouldn't arrest me because I have a child.\" Both of these protagonists really did commit crimes. If Javert allowed everyone to justify their criminal behavior the way Valjean and Fantine did, and if he automatically believed them, justice would not be served for some really nasty people. \n\nJavert is compelling because his refusal to give benefit of the doubt is both clearly flawed and impossible to function without. \n\nAt the end of the musical, Javert's suicide isn't just \"I can't handle being told I am wrong\". It's that there is no alternative. \"And must I now begin to doubt? Who never doubted all these years? My heart is stone and still it trembles. The world I have known is lost in shadow.\" He recognizes that his heart has hardened due to his job, but Valjean's kindness is so powerful to him that it completely changes him. Just as he commits suicide, he says, \"As I stare into the void of a world that cannot hold\u2026 There is nowhere I can turn. There is no way to go on!\" \n\nHe's not committing suicide because he doesn't like being shown to be wrong. Javert's suicide is the realization that, despite dedicating his life to it (\"I am the law\"), he is fundamentally unable to serve justice. There is no option that allows him to do so. He must either err on the side of allowing awful people to go free (and his many years of experience makes this unbearable) or he must err on the side of being a destructive force for people who are fundamentally good. But no matter what, *he will err*. That is what is unbearable to Javert and what leads him to commit suicide. \"There is no way to go on\" when faced with this moral ambiguity. He no longer knows what is right.\n\nIt's not only character development at its most fundamental, it's a challenge that many people struggle with constantly. How do I protect my own emotions and hold people accountable for their actions, but still allow myself to pick out those Valjeans who are good people despite the actions I am seeing? No one can do it right all the time, and Javert is no different from any of the rest of us on that. \n\nFor this reason, Javert is my favorite musical antagonist. (I actually have a pet named after him. [Meet my tiger oscar, Javert!](http://imgur.com/cHu7jBW))\n\nResponse B Author: leif827\n\nResponse B: But that's the entire point of his character. His character development shows the internal struggle of a man who has followed these rigid laws his whole life, and now once they are taken away he is a broken man. It's part of the beauty of the character. Most people are bendy but hard to break, but he's rigid - until he snaps.\n\nIt's entirely character development. Just an unusual one.\n\nA good Javert can be incredible. It's one of the most challenging roles to play simply because of above reasons, but if done right it adds SO much.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author intangiblemango's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

The size of a pizza is related to its area, which for regular pies is \\pi*r^2. Since the size grows as the square of the radius, a small increase in a pizza's radius can result in a large increase in the size of the pie. An 18\" pie is 20% larger then a 16\" pie. My point is that when places like Dominos and Pizza Hut sell you S, M, L pies, you have no way to know what you are getting. They should put their sizes in units that are convenient for determining the actual size of the pie. What would be so hard about that? \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: DDB-\n\nResponse A: \nThis actually isn't the case as all. When you order pizza through their website they tell you the size of their pizzas. Here is a screenshot of [Dominos Order Page](http://i.imgur.com/b1JiRj3.png) and here is a screenshot of [Pizza Hut's](http://i.imgur.com/yxvHDji.png).\n\nThey tell you the diameter of the pizza, so the only unknown is the thickness, which is consistent within each pizza place and fairly similar across many of them. Also, since you're not really arguing about the thickness I'll leave this as it is as there is much less ambiguity in how thick a style of pizza will be.\n\n\nThe reason for not having this information in the actual advertisement is you don't need to present the watcher with more information than they can digest in a short 15 or 30 second ad. People don't want to do math when watching a TV, even if it is a simple measurement like 12\" that they are all accustomed to. They aren't trying to hide it from you as the information is readily available when you go to order, and if you are behind the times and still use a phone to order pizza I am certain they would tell you if you ask. \n\nIf you're upset at ordering a \"large\" pizza for $5.99 and only got a 10\", the only one at fault is you for blindly assuming how big a large is when the information on how big a Pizza Hut or Dominos large is already available. There isn't a reason to standardize if they tell you what the sizes actually measure out to be already.\n\nResponse B Author: garnteller\n\nResponse B: It's not always a fair comparison- say a pan pizza, which is much thicker and denser with ingredients, and thus a medium regular and medium pan would both serve a comparable number of people, even with a different diameter.\n\nAnd if you are concerned, you can always call the shop and ask how large the pizza is - problem solved.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author DDB-'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Probably not even her biological heart, as everything we attribute to someone \"having heart\" is actually various bits of their brain (I think the prefrontal cortex? But I haven't taken biology in a long time); the essence of a person isn't in their organs; once a person is dead, they're gone... seeing the body is more to give a sense of closure than anything. But the thing to remember about death is that, whether or not the body has its kidneys, the body is no longer the person it used to be... just the vessel that that person's consciousness once inhabited, but no longer.\n\nI understand not wanting the body to look bruised and whatnot, but as I understand it, that's what a funeral parlor's staff is for, in part: applying makeup and the like to hide discoloration and other things for viewings.\n\nResponse B Author: Lokipi\n\nResponse B: \nWhy does it even matter if a person is not buried whole. An amputee is not any less of a person for \"not being whole\" its their personality and experiences that makes them a person which are stored in the brain.  if you believe your essence is in your brain, once the brain is gone, the body is no longer the person it once was.\n\nSecondly people live on after death in the memories of others and the actions and things they leave behind, wouldn't it carry and honor their memory further if part of them physically lived on in someone else and if their last worldly action was to save someone elses life.\n\nLastly on a moral standpoint, organ donation makes the world a better place.

Everything happens for a reason, after all. But the goal is unpredictability, which is easy for humans. Imagine if I asked you to provide \"random\" numbers to me, between one and 10. If you actually wanted to help me and provide numbers, you have plenty of ways to do this. \n\nMaybe you could just guess numbers in your head - you might start with 3 or 7, but after that I have no way to know what numbers you're predicting. You might think \"hmm, I used 3 a while ago so I don't want to use that one again just yet\", or \"I bet he's expecting a 5 here, gonna throw him for a loop!\"... I think most people would eventually produce a stream of numbers that look fairly diverse. Another idea is to get out a timer with millisecond resolution, start it and then stop whenever you feel like it, giving me the last digit. Since we aren't superhuman it's pretty hard to stop on exactly X.XX1 seconds.\n\nIf you really want to be special, you could take a reliable computer algorithm and simply perform its steps exactly. If we treat these as random and you're doing the same exact operations, then the numbers you're giving me are also random by definition.

Yes, there are times when it may be morally right to not try to convince people not to commit suicide, such as when they have a terminal condition and killing themselves would help ease the pain.  If a person has also thought long and hard in a rational and lucid state, then perhaps it may not be morally wrong to stop them either.  Unfortunately most suicides stem from panic and a sense of failure about a current situation, instead of absolute certainty or other solutions.  \n\nMany people that are talked out of suicide may not try again, mainly because they may have received help.  If we assume that many people having attempted suicide may not want to later, we can assume that their lives have improved, and thus the act of suicide will only give loss.  It is for this reason that most would think it a good idea to help talk people out of suicide.  This is an irreversible solution, and as such it should always be considered a last resort.  Methods of prevention are very important  due to how many people they save that may experience relief, rather than ending it and being no longer able to feel.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author scottevil110's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

It is very hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that women can be so selfish to give up a life, when there are families out there trying so hard to have children, but can\u2019t. In our society today, the amount of people looking to adopt is so large that almost any person who doesn't want to keep their child can find a suitable home for him/her. Growing up in a conservative, catholic, family has definitely altered my view about abortion, and going to catholic school has pushed it even farther. Abortion is against the catholic religion, and there are many different family planning options that anyone can use. I have learned for years that abortions can cause severe emotional trauma, and many people regret it afterwards, so why should it be allowed in the first place. I have also heard many times that it is the women\u2019s body and she should decide what to do with it. Yes, I do believe that to be true in some sense, but once you have another life inside of you, it isn't just your body, its their body too. Abortion was illegal in the United States for some time, but eventually was ruled constitutional by some means. With all of that being said, I do agree that there needs to be better sources of education for troubled women who don\u2019t have anyone to turn to for guidance. I also know the dangers if the woman\u2019s life is at risk, but in modern society there are many different approaches that can deal with these situations. \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: NormBethune\n\nResponse A: I think there's an obvious philosophical argument to be had about the rights of women. It has been done better by other people. I'm going to make a point about public health. People want to control when they have kids. The primary reason why people have sex isn't to have kids. And if that comes up as a surprise it can be a terrifying shock. The choice to have an abortion often doesn't really feel like a choice in someone's panic. That's why when abortion was illegal people went great distances to get them. Doctor's would tell women to rinse with lye and soap vigorously. People used copper coat hangers. And women died. You do not want people doing complicated procedures like this at home with no supervision and training. So from a practical public health viewpoint, it has to be legal.\n\nLegally, it is even more complicated. Do you want women who receive abortions to receive life in prison? When abortion was illegal in Canada, a few doctors began doing the procedure and courts didn't know how to prosecute. It becomes even harder when you talk about spontaneous or life-saving abortions. Legal questions about abortions can result in women dying from pregnancy complications because abortion laws are not clear. That's unacceptable.\n\nThere's also the question of what life is. I really don't think a zygote is a human life any more than a sperm cell is. You may see this differently because of your background. But the legal and public health concerns are the practical reality that means abortion has to be legal. If this upsets you, I'd suggest not going to route of making abortion illegal. I would rather suggest that you support improving foster care, access to contraception, sexual education, and maternal support systems. If people are educated and supported, fewer abortions will happen and the quality of life for everyone will increase.\n\nResponse B Author: DrIblis\n\nResponse B: Do you think that women *want* to get abortions?\n\nThe real question to ask is what is the primary cause of abortions. If women don't get pregnant when they do not want children, then there would be no (or very few) abortions. Would you agree?\n\nI think it is safe to say that the primary cause of abortions is unwanted pregnancies. Since this is the case, then what can be done about preventing unwanted pregnancies? (hint, it's birth control and safe sex practices).\n\nBut what about in the case of rape or circumstances where the life of the mother is in danger? In these instances, I think most people would agree that abortion should be legal.\n\nPersonally, I hold the view that \"Abortion should be legal, but unnecessary\"\n\nSimply making abortions illegal will not stop abortions- just like making murders illegal doesn't stop murders from occuring. For one to actually stop an event from happening, one must analyze *why* it occurs and *what* can be done about it. Increasing exposure to contraceptives and lowering the cost of elective surgeries such thas the reversible polymer gel that shreds sperm that is injected into males or even more permanent options are excellent ways of curbing the amount of unwanted pregnancies. \n\nBecause in the end, if a woman needs an abortion to save her life, and it is illegal, then there will be significant complications that I leave up to your imagination.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author NormBethune's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I believe that certain scenes/sequences can't possibly be filmed without the use of CGI, and can't see why it's such a bad thing - For example, I think that the CGI based Hulk from the MCU is much more 'Comicbook'y and and was quite enjoyable, compared to the old Hulk TV series that featured Lou Ferrigno in body paint (It definitely was an  entertaining show, but I feel that having something similar in the MCU would probably be weird to the viewer than what they have currently).So, Reddit, CMV.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: IIIBlackhartIII\n\nResponse A: I think the general stigma against CGI is that it is often used as a means of substituting practical effects in ways that are less visually pleasing. Good CGI takes expertise and time and a ton of money, and a lot of film companies are getting very lazy and using CGI where it's unneeded. For example, the CGI in the original Lord of the Rings trilogy was absolutely ground-breaking and amazing, and yet the new ones looked like much less time and care went into it and ended up ruining a lot of the aesthetics. The practical effects in the original Star Wars trilogy were ground-breaking and amazing, and yet the new trilogy ones looked like much less time and care went in and ended up ruining a lot of the aesthetics. \n\nThe big problem is the CG can often be a cop out and many directors don't understand the rigour needed to make CG look good. The best CG is a blend of practical and computer effects, stuff like District 9 and Elysium where they spent a lot of time actually setting off dust explosions and working to make things in camera working with and interact with what would be happening in computer later. The best CGI is done with a team of people dedicated to making it look good, spending a lot of painstaking months working on it... most modern films get pumped out and there's some lazy directors saying \"screw it, fix it in post, we'll let our whiz kids do it!\". \n\n\nResponse B Author: EZobel42\n\nResponse B: I don't think that anyone really hates CGI in general, but its overuse. Yes, there are many sequences in modern blockbusters that need CGI, and look incredible because of them. But other sequences and affects, be they blood splatters in action movies, or monster make up and animetronics, don't need CGI to work well. Many movie enthusists have grown tired of the use of nothing but CGI to get the job done. \n\nBack when CG was first being used in movies in the 90's, they would use a variety of effects for the same thing, to keep the illusion going. Movies like Jurassic Park hold up so well because the dinosaurs are only CG for the distant shots, or the big moments. But in close ups, the dinos are animatronics. \n\nA similar thing happened in Lord of the Rings. Yeah, the CGI battles look incredible, but when they could, the team just used extras in classic prosthetics to do the orcs.\n\nThis changing between illusions makes the effect harder to pin down, and more immerse. You use CGI for the things that physically cannot exist, but, when the shot, through angle or perspective, lets you use something practical, you take the chance. If the moviegoer sees the characters interacting with a practical effect, it makes it seem like the whole sequence was made with practical effects.

That's a common psychological automatism to reduce [cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) and may even prevent traumates that could result from that cognitive dissonance.

Abusing the up- and downvoting system is just a symptom of that__, it's not some evil plot to discriminate minorities or whatever.\n\nPeople believing that one shouldn't abuse the up- and downvote system are ironically in the majority, but still they might be doing that themselves unconciously.\n\n_By making clear that the own opinion might contradict with what most people believe to be right, down- and upvotes now becomes the focus of attention for the reader._ That leads to a situation where many people might be inclined to hold high their own illusive morality of _not_ abusing the vote system, so they are less prone to do it unconciously this time.\n\nThat is at least my thesis why it works...\n\nNow people want to not be excluded from groups for the same reason (to prevent cognitive dissonance, or psychological integrity in general). Since to say that their own opinion would probably be unpopular seems to make it more popular, one is going to decide to do this in the same unconcious way another person would downvote an opinion he doesn't like.\n\n_With that in mind, I don't have a problem anymore with people trying to protect their own psychological health._ Maybe this insight can \"set you free\" the same way.\n\nPS: This could be a reddit meta topic instead of being limited to a CMV topic.\n\nResponse B Author: yes_thats_right\n\nResponse B: It is very common in English to proceed statements which we know will be unpopular with acknowledgment that what we say may not be a popular idea or may make some people uncomfortable etc.\n\nDoing this in a reddit comment is just an extension of how we talk in person.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author cyrusol's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Liberals keep getting called socialists, and it makes socialism seem a lot more palatable to the average person, emboldening actual socialists and legitimizing them in the eyes of society. People are going to look at that and think \"OK, if supporting affordable health care makes me a socialist, then I guess I'm a socialist.\"\n\nSimilarly when SRS types accuse anyone vaguely critical of far-left orthodoxies of being a racist or sexist, it turns these positions from the fringe to the mainstream. Moderate conservatives and libertarians are constantly being baselessly attacked as being racist or sexist, what are they going to think? \"OK, so wanting tax reform makes me a racist, then I guess I'm a racist.\" \"OK, so believing in due process rights makes me a sexist, then I guess I'm a sexist.\" This again breaks down sensitivities, and makes non-imaginary instances of racism and sexism seem less abhorrent.\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: objection_403\n\nResponse A: Hyperbolic words is a form of [heuristics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) (especially when political).\n\n\nUnfortunately this doesn't seem to have worked in practice.  The left has become so afraid of hyperbole that they've slowly shifted to the right over the decades.  In the recent Congressional elections they were terrified to be associated with Obamacare and \"socialism.\"  That's because, unfortunately, heuristic thinking is effective on a wide-scale.\n\n\n\nI'm not so sure about that.  There's always an extremist on every side, and I find that generally if you accuse a moderate of being extreme, the first thing they do is point to the extreme saying \"this is dumb, I'm clearly not like them.\"  \n\nI think **not** being a member of that extreme is why they end up holding the same position.  They're able to completely disregard the opinion of the person making the accusations because the accusation seems to extreme itself.  It's a way of insulating yourself from the criticism rather than associating yourself with the criticism's comparison. \n\nResponse B Author: Pilebsa\n\nResponse B: Hyperbole is a very effective tool to seize control of a debate or issue when you don't have more substantive evidence to stand on.  Calling someone a \"socialist\" or comparing them to \"nazis\" is called a \"Strawman argument\" - it's used to *attack the messenger, ignore the message* and dismiss his argument without due consideration.   The right very effectively use this technique to push through various issue-positions that do not have the real-world references to back them up.\n\nFurthermore, many people who hold positions on certain issues, do so not because they've rationally arrived at a thoughtful conclusion based on available evidence.  It's an emotional position.  And hyperbole is targeted at peoples' emotions.   Likewise, when trying to \"reason\" with a person who holds an unreasonable position, logic and thoughtful argument doesn't often work.  Mockery and shame is a time-tested tactic.\n\nI don't approve of it,  not at all.  But there is no doubt that using these techniques is very effective in manipulating people, especially those who are averse to doing their own homework and coming up with their own conclusions.\n\nHyperbole is used very effectively in a number of scenarios:\n\n* Religion - most religions use *shame* as a tactic to impose order, obedience and conformity.  It's the basis of the Judeo-Christian sects for sure.  Mankind is \"cursed\" and must \"atone\".  That's an emotional appeal.  \n\n* Talk radio and right wingers use strawman arguments, false dichotomies (suggesting issues are one-extreme or the other, i.e. \"If you don't support invading xxxx then you hate America.\"), false equivalences (both sides of an issue are equally at fault, etc.) -- all of these techniques are methods of misdirecting debate in favor of personal attacks.\n\n* Liberals use these techniques as well, recently evidenced by the current \"anti-vaxxer\" arguments online - anyone who expresses concern over vaccinations is often personally attacked and publicly humiliated.  \n\nDo these things tend to polarize and exclude people from thoughtful debate and compromise?   I think yes, in some cases, but I think in other cases there is also evidence that trying to reason with an unreasonable person is an exercise in futility -- and in those cases, more hyperbolic engagement does make a difference.  \n\nI think if you cite extreme examples on each side of this issue, they play into the scenario you have adopted and I wouldn't disagree with you, but this is also a false dichotomy.   There are many in-between shades of gray, where sometimes it *can* be effective to mix rational debate with a bit of hyperbole and emotional appeal.\n\nI think the biggest misconception in all, is the notion that anybody's point of view will be immediately, dramatically changed as a result of *any* argument.  This just isn't the way these things work.  Usually \"seeds of dissenting ideas\" are planted by opposing forces, and those seeds take time to germinate and grow within the other person.  Those seeds can be planted by both rational, respectful discourse, or through hyperbole and emotional appeals.   Usually, the more difficult ideas to undermine require a lot of time, and a lot of emotional appeals.

So really, if you live in a philosophy that there is no objective \"good,\" then you don't believe in an objective \"evil.\"\n\n*However,* that is not the question at hand. The question at hand is whether or not evil *exists,* which is independent of whatever we choose to believe. This is not really possible to prove 100%, but if you have any sort of definition of \"Good,\" then you are also, by extension, defining what \"evil\" is, therefore stating that it exists.\n\nSo if it is your belief that evil does not exist, then by extension, you also don't believe in an objective good. However,\n\n\nCommon connotation of the word \"toxic\" usually lines up with \"bad.\" In your case, I think you more mean it to mean \"unproductive,\" but the implication is that it is still an undesirable concept. \n\nMeaning, you're implying that it would be objectively *good,* in all situations, to not use the word \"evil.\" Here you're implicitly defining the use of \"evil\" as evil, which is somewhat of a contradiction to your main point of evil not existing at all.\n\nAttempt 2: Child abuse exists.\n\nResponse B Author: MorganaLeFaye\n\nResponse B: Evil is a word we use to describe the absence of good and/or intentional harm done unto others. \n\nSo, although it is possible to review situations labeled as \"evil\" under a critical eye and gain understanding about motivations and intentions, there is still a time when there is more intentional harm/bad done to people than good in any given situation. \n\nLooking at the Holocaust is a good example of this (because, it's the internet and of course it was going to come up). You may be able to look at it from Hitler's point of view and, through some warped justification, argue that he was trying to do what he thought was best. That may be true, but that is only one half of the argument to consider. How many people were harmed during his quest to do what was best? And how many people's lives were made better? \n\nBecause the situation is so clearly unbalanced, with far more people suffering because of Hitler's actions than benefiting from them, it is safe to say that the Holocaust/Hitler was evil. \n\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Tapeleg91's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I have always received poor grades in math classes throughout school even when I got a tutor and came in before class to get extra help from the teacher. The only time I got great grades in math was when I had a teacher that I later learned graded work and tests upon completion not accuracy\n\nI hold my view because I feel like after looking at math compared to other subjects, it seems like math is the only true subject. Science, technology and engineering (the rest of STEM) are all highly based in math and one could not succeed in either of those subjects without a high skill in math.\n\nI look at history and other social studies and see only memorizing facts, dates and concepts. This distresses me because  those courses were some of the ones that I was the best at, but feel unsure of how much use I could get out of them in the \"real world\"\n\nEven the subjects I feel that are my best (English and literature) seems to show little measure of intelligence. When I look at all the English and lit classes that I have taken (all of them honors and A.P) at school I feel like the classes boil down to ones opinion of a text so there is no right or wrong answer as long as you can justify your answer. I can not think of any other subject that works this way and feel that even though I am good in this subject it seems rather useless unless you want to be a teacher, which I would only do if I had no other employment options. \n\nWhen I look at mathematics I see a genuine skill, not memorization or justifying your opinion. There is only a single correct answer in math (I know there are a few exceptions but that is besides the point). At my school at least (I just graduated from a relatively small high school, graduating class of about 120) high level math classes are a strong indicator of intelligence. People at my school were shocked to learn that I was not in calculus (the highest level of math at my school) or even the level before it. My classmates often assumed me to be intelligent, due to the fact that I took several non math AP classes but I do not feel intelligent. \n\nMy low math scores on the SAT as well as my gpa made mine significantly lower than most of my friends. I feel that me not being good at math shows that I am less intelligent and that math is single best way to measure a persons intelligence. \n\nI am very nervous about what to major in since I feel I could try to struggle through a STEM major, or study what interests me (the notion of doing what you love over what will make money has always bother me. Every non STEM major I am interested are considered to be some of the most useless majors around. I am afraid that if I major in a liberal  arts subject that my job prospects will be horrendous\n\nI feel that math is the best way to measure a persons intelligence, even if it means that I am not intelligent. Please change my view!\n\n \n\nOn a side note, does anyone have any career related stories, as I have always been afraid that because I am bad at math, my career prospects are minimal compared to those who are good at math\n\nResponse A Author: Amarkov\n\nResponse A: \nLiterally every other subject works this way. \n\nUnfortunately, we don't always teach very well at the high school level, so we sometimes get people thinking that history is about memorizing dates and math is about using the One Right Method to get the One Right Answer. But in every academic field, being able to clearly and concisely argue in favor of a point is a necessary skill. If you're just memorizing dates or just crunching numbers, you're not really doing history or math.\n\nResponse B Author: logblobo\n\nResponse B: I was in a very similar situation as yours. \n\nI've been in AP classes throughout high-school, but I took a \"transitional math\" class my freshman year due to my deficiencies in the subject. I have a cumulative 4.0 GPA, but my math scores in the ACT are less than pretty. \n\nPerhaps understanding concepts and thinking in an abstract, non-linear form is the most important thing a human being can do. Math often comes down to memorizing formulas, remembering basic math skills, and intuitively linking what you're doing now with what you've done in the past to solve similar equations. Understanding the concepts and the stories of history through cause and effect, critically evaluating it, takes skill that not every individual holds. A critical and logical mind can find beautiful connections that prove they understand humanity and cause and effect.\n\nThe problem with viewing math as the best indicator of intelligence is that it's not an objective ability - something not even literature or history can be considered. The truth is, it's arbitrary to measure somebody's intelligence based on their success in any subject. \n\nNon-linear, free-form thinking is likely the only way to objectively measure ones intelligence. [Marcus Hutter] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Hutter#Universal_artificial_intelligence_.28AIXI.29) would have you use mathematics as a way to gauge a third party's intelligence, a very novel idea. He uses it similar to how a thermometer gauges the temperature of its'  surroundings. \n\nHere's my only problem with this: Just as a thermometer gauges the current temperature of its' surroundings, any current method evaluates ones current understanding of a variety of concepts. Water's temperature will be altered by an incredibly vast array of external influences. Our \"intelligence\" will be altered by a huge archive of things, including mathematics. **Neither the temperature of altered water nor the intelligence of an educated human being are intrinsic, so both will change.** Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Amarkov's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Yet I have always vehemently(perhaps fallaciously) argued with people who claim that consciousness cannot possibly be a result of biology, and greater metaphysical notion of the soul must explain its existence.\nI maintain that our consciousness is simply an expression of biology, and that there will come a point in time at which our understanding of the brain will catch up with our understanding of the rest of our body. At this stage, we would be capable of creating consciousness similar to our own. I believe that our current inability to explain the nature of our self-awareness is rooted in ignorance of our biology. I have no concrete scientific knowledge on which I rest my argument besides the fact I cannot see a reason to believe that a metaphysical explanation is necessary. This ignorance about the brain is comparable to people in bygone era's being unaware of how our bodies functioned. As developments in anatomy allowed us to map each blood vessel in our bodies so to will neuroscience map each neuron in our brain.\nThis is a difficult existential idea to tackle, and is an uncomfortable position to hold as it indicates a lack of true free will and the existence of determinism, which in turn has implications on our ideas of morality. I look forward to some enlightenment on my perhaps ignorant ideas reddit!\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: KitAndKat\n\nResponse A: Firstly, consciousness is the primary source of your knowledge of the world. To construct a mental model of the world and then claim there is no room/need for consciousness is like building a table, then kicking all the legs away.\n\nIf consciousness is an artifact or side-effect of complexity, then you must concede that computers, now or at some later stage, will acquire consciousness, over and above AI or neural nets, where we simply code them to emulate human behavior.\n\nAn alternate view of consciousness is that the brain is a receiver of consciousness, in the same way that a TV receives signals. You can look in the TV and see how signals turn into pictures; you can show that breaking a component removes the picture, but none of that shows that the picture is created by the TV.\n\nNow some arguments for that case.\n\nMany mystics have come to the same conclusion. Sure, you can call them deluded, but they all came to this conclusion by studying consciousness itself directly.\n\nThe Western view of the self is as an autonomous independent individual. This is clearly incomplete or wrong when we look at the evidence. We are whole, yes, but we are also part of a hierarchy. Koestler coined the term *holon* for this, see \"*Janus*\". When you answer \"who am I?\", the answers are Jim; an American; one of the Smith family; a Dodgers fan; a human; and many others. At times our consciousness can transcend our solitary self and identify with the larger group: go to a football match; watch a sunset; partake in a riot; make love; save your child from drowning. Yet the current paradigm of individual consciousness is so pervasive that we do not even see these other states, or we dismiss them as hallucinatory.\n\nNone of this is conclusive proof, but a case can be made that consciousness is not just a brain attribute, and the fact that we have not found it in the brain so far is a clue that we are looking in the wrong place. Even when we find clues, they may only represent signals in the TV set.\n\nResponse B Author: Jaeil\n\nResponse B: \nIt is okay to believe as a personal suspicion that consciousness is material rather than immaterial.  However, if you have no scientific evidence to support this claim, you should not - you *ought* not* - go around claiming it as fact.\n\nIf the evidence was all finally compiled and seemed to indicate that an immaterial brain *was* necessary, would you be stubborn or would you cede to the evidence?  If you wouldn't, you are not open to changing your view.  If you would, then you must admit that, in lieu of having the full picture, you should not preemptively make claims about what it is.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author KitAndKat's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: This could be stemmed from my poor social experiences or from what i learnt in my psychology diploma, and soon recently came to the conclusion that there is no true kindness/altruism whatever you call it. \n\nFor a behavior to happen, there needs to be some sort of motivation. Intrinsic or extrinsic, there is a need for people to behave a certain way. Extrinsic motivation is plain and simple. The most common is money. People work for money, people steal for money, people who do charity gain acceptance of society, which in turn lets them earn more from their enterprises since the company they represent is more accepted. That's what i believe. \n\nEven if there is an intrinsic motivation, the person definitely have to do it for his or her own cause. For example, a generous person who makes self-sacrifices for others could gain satisfaction in his own mind that he's done something \"good\" and the social acceptance which he gets would motivate him to do more kind deeds, since society as a whole promotes pro-social behaviors. \n\nOr someone sees an injustice and steps in for the victim. The person seeing the injustice could just be annoyed at the situation and in order to resolve the annoyance he steps in to help the weak. I would also think that that's just a method for the person to deal with some internal unsolved issues to make himself/herself feel better. For example, a man who was a bully victim steps in to fight off some bullies because he did not have the courage to stand up to them when he was younger. Because of that, he may feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction in himself. Thus, since there is a personal gain, I do not see pure kindness. \n\nSo basically even when someone does something good or kind, i would attribute it to his or her need to be socially accepted or the self-satisfaction, and when there's personal gain from displaying pro-social behaviors, I do not believe that people can have pure kindness. But hey, that's just my opinion man.\n\n\n\nNo matter how I looked at things, I can always attribute acts if kindness with some form of personal gains. \n\nI may not have phrased it correctly saying that everyone is selfish. I just tend to be quite avoidant at times and think the worst of people. Lol\n\n\nResponse A Author: convoces\n\nResponse A: What is \"pure\" kindness? There seems to be an assumption that there is some unattainable kindness that is completely free of any selfishness.\n\nThis kind of reasoning has a flaw. First, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is a psychological theory, which is well and good, but it has not been rigorously proven or verified with *direct* evidence. This is not necessarily the fault of psychologists, but rather because of the fact that it is incredibly difficult to say for sure what is going on in the human brain.\n\nGiven that it is virtually impossible at this point in time to determine for sure what motivated an individual, at best, intrinsic/extrinsic motivation is a useful simplification of *unobservable* complex processes. \n\nThe fact that we cannot observe *exactly* what is going on will always give someone room to say \"well, I'm guessing that they risked their life to save that child from the building fire because they wanted to be socially accepted.\" And it will be impossible to convincingly prove that they did not. The best we can do is say that for many altruistic actions, the risk/effort involved is so high that really, the vast majority of other people wouldn't go to such lengths for such *little* reward or such *unlikely* reward. \n\nA soldier who dives on a grenade for his buddies in the foxhole, you could always accuse him of some ulterior motive because the psychological theory of motivation is unable to observe his *actual* feelings. But the fact that he did something with such a high cost to benefit ratio, we can reasonably label that as *altruism* in comparison to the vast majority of things, and it would be a *useful* label/word to use, even if no one can *prove* that the reason it was done was some impossible to observe and pedantic \"pure\" or \"selfish\" motive.\n\nResponse B Author: marlow41\n\nResponse B: For there to be any meaningful discussion here, you have to define \"true kindness/altruism.\" \n\n\nThat's pretty much it (excluding the end of that sentence on purpose). That's why I do good things. Generally speaking I do not get any satisfaction from having other people approve of my doing good things. To be honest, when other people notice me doing something good and laud me for it, I tend to be annoyed by it and less likely to do whatever that thing is. \n\nWhat I think you're failing to realize is that your view is more optimistic than the fairy tale. The fairy tale view is that people are basically good or bad naturally. Your view seems to be that if someone thought they could get away completely with doing something bad that would benefit them, then they would basically do it, but that social forces keep everyone in line. To be honest with you I'd rather have everyone being nice because they're afraid of being shunned than some random subset of people who are automatically going to try to shaft me for no reason no matter what. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is I agree with your worldview, but I disagree that it constitutes selfishness on the part of people practicing kind acts. Doing nice, generous things because you want to be seen as a good person, or because you actually are a good person: it doesn't really matter you're still doing nice things and that's unselfish.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author convoces's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: This isn't to say that I don't find any inherent purpose with these gimmicky devices. They've become a symbol of status in our culture, what with the expectation that you own a smartphone if you're anywhere in a professional setting. I remember an anecdote my father shared, where he was openly teased by his colleagues because he was still holding out on a dumbphone. It seems if you want to be taken seriously and mean business in the workforce, you need to own the latest pocketable supercomputers that are exponentially advancing in processing power faster than need be. What's the point of cramming all this powerful hardware into a device meant to be portable, only for all that processing power to never be fully and thoughtfully utilized by the majority of gadget users, and inversely drain battery life to the point of hindering users' potential volume of productivity?\n\nLet's face it: how many smartphone and tablet users actually demand that level of computing power? What tasks are they running that needs to utilize that power to the greatest extent possible? More important, will their tasks generate useful or meaningful output? If not, then why is one of the selling points of these gadgets their proclaimed facilitation of work productivity?\n\nThe reality of gadget usage should come as no surprise to anyone. They're used for trivial, privileging first-world tasks that prove to just be spoiling amenities. Don't deny it: we're not getting any useful work done with them. Take selfies and post to Facebook in less than 15 seconds? Send one another inappropriate faces on Snapchat? Browse the web (Reddit), text, and watch Netflix on the toilet? All these actions are possible in just a pocket away if you ever need to suppress the monotone boredom of visiting family, car trips, intellectual downtime, and, yes, going to the restroom.\n\nWhat people use their gadgets for can *certainly* be done on a laptop, a desktop, or the dreaded dumbphones! Even more usefully and productively! But we've all grown impatiently spoiled and we want that common functionality in any given instant in just a pocket away. Traditional computers and phones are old-fashioned and pedestrian; they aren't impressive when the same light functionalities can be done on a flashy touchscreen only inches long and millimeters thin!\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I'm not hating on gadgets. I'm rocking an LG Optimus V bought used on eBay for $32. But I don't use it as a *smartphone* so much as a dumbphone. All I need out of a phone is calling, texting, maybe the occasional picture taking. Used in conjunction with Google Voice, I basically have free service over WiFi. (Take that, monthly contract providers.) I'm probably getting greater battery life on this thing than on any dumbphone, because my tasks are so light on a relatively large battery. Couldn't have done all this without an Android running phone.\n\nMy gripe with the whole gadget deal is that we're whetting our appetites over inflating spec sheets when we don't even *require* such computing power nor can we be *truly* productive with them in the same way we can with traditional computers. And we're all willingly throwing our money at these big manufacturers, for gadgets that follow an inverse performance-productivity relationship. Tasks that can be done on a computer, should be done on a computer. Otherwise, it just looks like flashy pseudo high-tech when you're sending an email or browsing via phone when there's a more appropriate platform in front of you. \n\nTL;DR Gadgets aren't useful.\n\nI'm open to alternate views! CMV.\n\nResponse A Author: OlderThanGif\n\nResponse A: A lot of your comments seem to focus around productivity and useful output and what's *absolutely crucial*.\n\nMaybe I'm doing something wrong, but I can't fathom why anybody would buy something that improves their productivity. Is it a crime that I bought my smartphone because it improves my *life* rather than my productivity? In terms of the number of (great) friends I can see and the frequency I see them with, owning a smartphone has probably increased that a full order of magnitude as compared to just a few years ago when I didn't have a smart phone.\n\nIf someone cancels plans, I can create new plans immediately, meeting at a restaurant none of us has ever tried before (but we can verify it gets good reviews while en route), share pictures and music. Someone else mentioned finding directions and you said you could do the same with a simple GPS. Nope. A simple GPS doesn't know when the next bus is coming. A simple GPS doesn't know when the last subway is running. A simple GPS doesn't know what the traffic conditions are like on one freeway as compared to the next. Even if it *did* do all of these things, why would I want to pay more money to carry around multiple devices to do half of what a smartphone does? None of it makes any sense to me. I use my smartphone to find the nearest car (with the car-sharing service I'm subscribed to) to me and reserve it. I'm a dancer and can look up videos of dance moves and performances while I'm at rehearsal.\n\nI don't care about productivity but I do care about connecting with people and exploring hobbies and the world around me, and for most things I care about, smartphones make my life better.\n\nResponse B Author: howbigis1gb\n\nResponse B: I believe Google Voice on the phone DOESN'T call over wifi.

Maybe it is different now.\n\nMaybe you're referring to the new hangouts?\n\nI know Skype does call over WiFi though.\n\n\nI don't see what your problem with gadgets is. Are you claiming people ought not to be able to do certain things with phones?\n\nAre you claiming people cannot be judicious and responsible in their use?\n\n\nFor example - Vines are entertaining. Am I to fault people for using their phones to make them?\n\nTwitter is a great source for news.\n\nI use the Android for development.\n\nIt's great for playing music on a roadtrip and also as a GPS (which incidentally is very expensive, along with subscription fees)\n\nI like to take pictures. I don't currently have a DSLR, and don't take my point and shoot everywhere - so the phone does great for candid shots.\n\n \nI use it to keep in touch with my friends from across the world - something a dumbphone won't let me do.\n\nI can access internet on my laptop on the go.\n\nLets take the cost of ownership. \n\nIf you have a basic contract - chances are you are subscribing for data. By not using a smartphone - you aren't getting a bang for your buck.\n\nA smartphone; very simply put - is NOT a luxury device anymore. \n\nThe entry price point for a smartphone is much lower than it used to be.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author OlderThanGif's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

For example: Living in close proximity to nature encourages environmental conservation and facilitates communal life.\n\nI'd like to hear the opposite view as I may be moving to an urban neighbourhood soon enough and would love to have mine changed. I just can't see it. *Is* an urban setting better for fostering social and environmental values? If so, how?\n\n\nResponse A Author: sheep74\n\nResponse A: I think the countryside can end up harboring some pretty nasty views. Because they tend to be quit tight-knit communities they can become very hostile to outsiders, very racist for example. So while they may have a stronger sense of community within themselves, the social values end there. \n\nI think, around me certainly, they actually give less fucks about the environment. Farming is king, if that means they have to spray that pesticide that may get into the food chain and water, fuck it, they need their crops. Cull the badgers, and the foxes etc etc. \n\nI think in a way the increased space allows for that sort of thinking. In cities there's so little green space that any negative thing is quite clear, that's why small parks can end up looking awful really quickly. But it also motivates people more because that's all they have. Whereas in the countryside, who cares if there's a load of trash in that bit of the forest, there's loads more. I'm only spraying this on one field, look around at all the others etc. \n\nI think, like another commenter said, you get more variety in people in cities. The social values are also more subtle. It's the 'not running the brown family out of town' value rather than the 'come on in neighbour, I just made cookies' value. And the environmental values are often more nebulous (since in a city you can't alter farming practices, you can't put solar panels in an apartment etc) and micro (riding a bike, cleaning the nearby park, having a window garden). Whereas if a farmer is going to go green, that's obviously huge. \n\nSo while i think both settings can push people either way, in my personal experience I've seen worse from people in the countryside. \n\n\nResponse B Author: EstoAm\n\nResponse B: In my experience countryside vs. urban has little to no effect on fostering social or environmental values. Far greater in this is education and exposure to a variety of cultures and environments.\n\nNo matter where you live respecting people and nature is something that is learned likewise disrespect for people or nature are also learned. \n\nIt is also my experience that in rural communities that I have experience interacting with both in the US and Europe tend to be less culturally diverse and also tend to have less access to education on topics that do not relate directly to some trade or profession.\n\nSo to summarize. I think that no matter where you live your education and role models are going to form your values on society and the environment. I also think that because Rural communities tend to on average be poorer and less likely to go to college which in my opinion makes it less likely for you to have the type of education and role models to give people the kind of progressive values that I think you are talking about.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author sheep74's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I'm not really viewing this from the outside in, though perhaps that perspective is what I need.\n\nI'm nineteen years old now, coming to realization with my sexuality when I had just turned thirteen years old. I was a loner who read, wrote, and gamed in my spare time rather than hang out with friends. People instantly expected me to talk with a lisp, walk with a strut, and love shopping. People equated me to being a 'gay best friend' on merit of that. It caused me to feel like this was the only way it was socially acceptable.\n\nI feel like endorsing this behavior, through the media, and equating it with being gay is harmful. For one, it's feeding the anti-gay fire. Covering yourself in penises, being out-of-the-norm for the sake of being out of the norm, and basically acting as freakish as possible could give otherwise on-the-fence people a bad impression. Instead of this exposure giving light to a serious issue (Recognizing that people who have an attraction to the same gender as equal, as the same as you), it just draws an association that being gay = being this annoying, immature stereotype. I've been in more than one situation where, for example, someone's watching television, a fast-talking, lispy, effeminate man comes on and is met with \"Damn faggots.\"\n\nI recognize that there are bigots who will hate/dislike/not accept homosexuality no matter what. But acting in this manner simplifies the issue, and allows people to assign x to y, taking a lot of gravity and maturity away from any moving forward.\n\nOn another note, if this is legitimately your personality, I don't think you should have to conform. But associating it with your sexuality on such a consistent basis (Talking like a gay guy, walking like a gay guy, dressing like a gay guy) isn't a good thing to do. This should instead be quantified as \"That's just how John acts\".\n\nI feel the best way to make progress is to... act like normal, productive members of society, or rather act like yourself, instead of a freak of nature. Protest in manners that aren't disgusting to people of a weaker disposition.\n\nTL;DR The typical gay stereotype makes gay people look like 'pets', or second-class, and destroys progress towards equality.\n\n\nResponse A Author: Bagodonuts10\n\nResponse A: A lot of straight people are equally as annoying. It also happens that they are often the loudest ones.  The thing is that when a straight person is annoying they are seen as an annoying person not as an annoying straight person.  \nThat's the nature of discrimination that people only associate a group with the most perceived negative attributes of that group.  This slowly begins to die as more and more people are coming out and more and more people are realizing that someone they respect and or love is gay.  It even happened with dick Cheney because of his lesbian daughter,  so I am optimistic it will continue to happen for other people.  \n\nSo yes, some people aren't the best examples to show your bigoted grandparents to change their view, but fuck it, that's not their job.  Work around the problem because telling people to act more straight to appease the masses is like telling a black person to act more white to appease the whites.  No, people shouldn't discriminate no matter how bad particular members of a group happen to be.  \n\nAlso my own personal opinion as a straight guy is that sometimes flamboyant people are annoying and sometimes they are awesome people.  The awesome ones shouldn't have to change just because some people have preconceived notions of what a man should be.  Like I said, it isn't their job to convert people to some kind of fake tolerance where it is only tolerance of people very similar to yourself.

Why?\n\nBecause in our culture we've built such strong views about the female physique, even legal views.  I do *not* believe that we, as a culture, should stifle change (this is, after all, natural evolution of society)...the problem with it, to me, is that we have such strong liability legislation and social statutes which create a disparity between how we're **told** we should now be treating breasts vs. how we **do** treat breasts.  For example;\n\nAs a male, any number of people could stare at my chest (shirtless or not), touch my chest, etc...without repercussion.  A bouncer at a bar could hold me at a distance by placing his hand there, for instance.  A person at my workplace could move me to the side at the chest level, also.  \n\nNone of those actions would be deemed appropriate if I were a woman.  Yet the most common argument I hear for equal sex shirtless legislation is **men can do it, women should be able to, as well. They're just breasts, get over it**, said by people who try to dismiss breasts flippantly as if it's \"just another body part\".  Which it is, however, clearly people *dont* feel that it's just another everyday body part...because I could get in severe trouble for touching them, or even looking too long.\n\nIt just seems to be like an awful double-standard...and until the same people who say \"they're just breasts\" *actually* believe that statement, then there's no point in trying to pretend that a spade is just a spade.\n\nCMV?\n\n\n\nFrom what I understand, it's more of a pseudo-hot button topic?

It would still be illegal to grope women in public, but just looking at someone is not a crime, and being undesirable to look at is not a crime either.\n\nI am from a city that allows women to be topless, and there are a few events that come to mind where it is common for women to take advantage of this law. When you see lots of average looking women walking around topless, you don't really think of them sexually, you just take a quick glance, think, \"Oh, look, boobs.  Neat\" and then go about your business.  I've never heard of anything negative coming about because of this.\n\nAnd in general, why should laws be made based on what is socially acceptable?  This seems similar to arguments for \"traditional marriage\" to me.\n\nResponse B Author: Dolphin_sandwhich\n\nResponse B: People used to believe it was not right for colored people to use the same facilities as the white folk, but with equality laws and over time people started getting over it. Maybe right now it's odd to see breasts as just a female chest because we continue to associate them with sex. With time and an open mind, maybe 3 generations from now it will be okay.

The direction of that grief or rage may often be molded by a director, but is he/she not still expressing that emotion?\n\nLikewise, musicians can still feel and be expressive about the music they are creating even if the direction of those emotions is determined by a conductor.\n\nWhat's more, creativity in playing can come from a number of factors, especially technically. The best musicians find incredibly technically difficult and creative ways to create the same sounds.\n\nSo while I do agree that individuals must concede degrees of their own creativity and expression to form a whole, I would disagree with the assertion that there is no creativity or expressiveness at all. \n\nResponse B Author: Raintee97\n\nResponse B: I like the example of the direct that u/bodoblock made, so I will try to expand on that. As the directors job is to pull the most from his or her actors the conductors role is to pull the most from his orchestra. Think  of it as  rise to potential. \n\nThe musician will make an interpretation of the director's wishes. The musician will have a role in the end effect music wise. They aren't just robots making music. They do have a major role as they empart their emotion into the music. \n\nThis vid is an odd example, but I place a significant amount of the net effect of the music on the people playing the music. The conductor is just helping to draw it out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-qKlCy0T-gWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Bodoblock's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Not the popular *Matrix* one, because it does not have complete control. I mean 100% control over the persons mental state. Typically, the experience machine is set to produce the greatest happiness possible, or the happiest mental state possible. That is the definition I am using here.\n\nAn act is morally justified if it creates the maximum pleasure for the maximum number. If the pleasure resulting from an act is more than the pain, then it is justified. (Consequentialism)\n\nIn my scenario, I forcibly connect a person into the experience machine. I force him to experience the greatest possible happiness imaginable, for the longest time possible. The sheer magnitude of pleasure far outweighs any pain/violation of rights I can cause in the kidnapping and so on, since the value of the pleasure here is infinite.\n\nThus, when such an experience machine is invented, it would always be justified to plug as many people into the machine as possible, no matter what pain is involved in the process. It would be immoral to deny the greatest possible happiness to someone.\n\nCMV!\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: swearrengen\n\nResponse A: But \"pleasure\" isn't the objective standard of \"good\" - the mind's mental integrity and rationality is the proper objective standard - which is only possible if that mind is living in reality!\n\nWhy? Because mental \"pleasure\" and \"pain\" are merely effects of mental health while Rationality is the cause, and rationality requires that what one experiences be real and not an illusion, even if it's painful.\n\nBoth pleasure and pain are only valuable if they inform us of the truth of our physical and mental state - that our body and/or mind is experiencing a gain or loss of *real* value. Ultimately this allows us to determine whether we should move forward or retreat, pursue goods or evade harm - the whole point of pleasure and pain is simply so our physical and mental form can persist being alive. \n\nIf that gain or loss is not real, then the pleasure or pain is false, misinforming, an illusion. \n\nPleasure is no good as an \"end in itself\" for the rational creature - but his own integrity and knowing what is real and not real *is*. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse B Author: Mobackson\n\nResponse B: This scenario is on the fundamental level an argument for \"the ends justify the means\" viewpoint. There is no point arguing your prerequisites on your machine so assuming that everything in your scenario is true, the situation is that of cost/reward and ends/means. Your claim states that because the end state of \"infinite happiness\" is the best possible state ever, the means where suffering first exists is negated since the end state provides greater happiness. \n\nThe greatest issue in this argument is that by accepting that \"the ends justify the means\" so long as the net gain of happiness (average amount of happiness times all the happy people subtract average amount of sadness times all the sad people) is positive, you must also apply the same logic to all other areas where this occurs (since we're talking pure logic). Following the logical progression, anything that sacrifices the individual to make the masses happy would be acceptable, following this moral code. Such as gladiators fighting to the death, extermination of minority ethnic groups for the gain of the majority, or having a whole class of students bully one kid to boost the self esteem of the group at the cost of the self esteem of the individual.\n\nAs many others have already said, another issue that crops up is the issue of personal value. Personally, I don't value happiness that high. To me, the greatest imperative is to think. Thinking doesn't make me happy, in fact, on occasion it can be exhausting or overall detrimental according to your value system. However, given the choice, I would choose to remain outside the machine (as your hypothetical kidnapped subject wants). \n\nAnother related point: its theorized that originally we evolved happiness as a value system to motivate us to reproduce and survive. I assume for a great many people (think mothers), to whom the greatest happiness is bringing new life into the world. The illusion the machine creates may feel like childbirth, but is a false illusion. In this scenario the person has not achieved maximal value, only maximal happiness (which therefore has not benefit the person the most, and therefore morally wrong). In this case the person has in fact come to a net loss of value since your kidnapping deprives them of the chance for childbirth, which in this assumption is their greatest goal.\n\nThe last point is that given that your assumption is that the machine is 100% controlling, it appears we are discussing basically an alternate universe where everyone is maximally happy, and that no one can tell that they are within the machine. As far as we know, as our marginal happiness increases, our tolerance for happiness also increases (downward-sticky, if you will). What I mean by this is that for a person living in the first world, something like three meals a day does not cause happiness, whereas for a person living in the third world it would. However, as the person in the third world becomes accustomed to having three meals a day, their happiness tolerance is increased, and they no longer feel happiness from this event. In fact, the increase of tolerance appears to be exponential, thus the machine would have to stimulate infinite happiness (which is your claim). However, once you get into infinities, it becomes much more of a math issue and also becomes much harder to quantify and discuss. The result this causes is that your argument stands on shaky assumptions and thus very hard to discuss.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author swearrengen's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

There are serious parallels between the Great Gatsby, and Hip-Hop culture. Both portray their main characters as being born from poverty, and progressing to riches only through disregard of their morals, chasing money. Illmatic, a hiphop classic, is full of references to this part of hiphop culture. \"Is like a maze full of black rats trapped\" says Nas, in the famous NY state of mind. The next track, \"Life's a bitch\" goes further into this mentality -\"Visualising the realism of life in actuality fuck who's the baddest a persons status depends on salary\". Another classic hiphop song C.R.E.A.M. resigns to this fact as Gatsby does - \"Cash rules everything around me.\"\n\nThe racism aspect is also clear - \"Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon, and at the airport they check all through my bags and tell me it's random **but we stay winning** \" This is also where the stereotypical hate for the police comes from. Nas, in a song about the crushing poverty where he grew up - Memory Lane - says \"No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace\". Even worse than the fellow black people trying to get out - like Gatsby, are the police, trying to keep the \" Black rats\" in the trap. \"Judges hanging niggas, incorrect bails, for direct sales, my intellect prevails, from a hanging cross, with nails.\"\n\nThe mentality of being born into a racist system, trying to keep you down, combined with the constant drumming into you what the American dream is, motivates people to do terrible things. But I think that Hiphop deserves more attention, and credit, for being a modern day retelling of the flawed American Dream, and Racist System, and what happens when they meet.\n\n\"He see it as another felony drug arrest, any day could be the day he picks the wrong thug to test, slug through the vest, shot in the street **for pulling heat on a father whose baby gotta eat**\"\n\nResponse A Author: Scarlett_ptista\n\nResponse A: You're saying that Hip Hop isn't \"getting credit\", but what does that really mean to you, OP? \nBecause I would argue that Hip Hop has been critically applauded in many, many ways, and, you can't get much more credit than archives being created to keep Hip Hop recordings and article clippings in [Adler Archive with its rare books and manuscripts in a secure vault 150 feet underground, at Cornell University.](http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/12/10/369841627/cornell-to-digitize-a-rich-hip-hop-archive). Cornell University recognizes Hip Hop works as something worth studying, and being available to scholars and the public. Additionally, Harvard University began to take it seriously over 10 years ago, in 2002 when it started its Hip-Hop Archive and Research Institute. \n\nThink about that, Harvard, a school synonymous with WASP's and privilege, the first thing you may think of when it comes to an \"Ivy League\" school, values Hip Hop so much they have a Research Institute and archive.\n\nA lot of other commenters are talking about the comparison you're making to the the glorification that Rock \"legends\" like Hendrix and The Stones have gotten. However, consider that their heyday was the 60's and 70's, whereas hip hop didn't really hit it's stride until the early 90's. \n\nI'd make a side point here that many early 90's genres are only just now getting major criticism recognition, and that's often for artists/styles that are effectively dead and gone (re: nirvana). Hip Hop, however, is still evolving, changing, and being mass produced, by artists both good and bad. Still, though, Hip Hop today is still a very valid genre, and there's a huge difference between Classic Hip Hop and *much* of the mainstream ilk out there. \n\nThere have been **classic** Hip Hop and Rap artists awarded that kind of recognition for example [Run DMC being inducted into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame in 2009](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run%E2%80%93D.M.C.) And, you have brought up Kayne's awards and critical fame [he's been featured on the Rolling Stone cover twice, and Jay-Z five times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_on_the_cover_of_Rolling_Stone), which I think essentially negates your own point --- Hip Hip is getting credit, just maybe not in the way you think it deserves. \n\nEnd point, scholars and musical critics alike note the influence and vastness of hip hop, and it's overall worth. That said, not every artist out there today is amazing, or worthy of drawing comparisons to classic literature, just like many other genres that put out popular music. \n\nCritical recognition is very different from public recognition, and Hip Hop has had a tough road in that respect, with a lot of negative publicity due to past gang violence, and now celebrity antics. No one, though, is arguing the worth of Hip Hop being less than any other musical genre out there, though. \n\nResponse B Author: jay520\n\nResponse B: Your view is WAY too vague. What does \"deserve more credit\" mean? What is it that you really want to see happen? For example, if hip-hop \"got\" the credit it deserved, then what would that look like, and how does it differ from what we see today? I'm not really sure what you're tangibly advocating for.\n\nI'm going to assume your post is a response to those who criticize most modern hip-hop/rap for it's materialism, misogyny, glorification of drugs/criminal culture, etc. To that, I would respond by acknowledging that the people who make these criticisms are not necessarily criticizing the entire genre. It's more like their criticizing the mainstream rap/hip-hop, which I believe deserves the criticisms. \n\nFurthermore, we can definitely criticize specific songs and/or artists who *happen* to be rappers. I see nothing wrong with that. If your music promotes bad ideas, then you deserve to be criticized. Simply being a hip-hop artists should not shield you from otherwise justified criticism.

CMV\n\nOp: Let me start by saying that I think a social safety net is a beautiful and noble idea. If it were used properly, it would assist people who have fallen on hard times until they can get back on their feet. Unfortunately, in the US, that idea doesn't seem to be working very well.\n\nI believe that government support simply creates a culture of laziness and a mentality of entitlement. I believe it makes people weaker and is just another tool used by those in power to control and suppress the stupid masses. When someone has to fend for themselves, they become stronger. When someone else feeds them, they lose the ability to feed themselves. But people do enjoy handouts (everyone does, even the wealthiest) and by throwing them a bite, it's easy to get their votes. It makes people complacent and less likely to push themselves to learn new skills and persevere.\n\n***I know anecdotal evidence isn't proof of anything, but neither are statistics so don't get on that \"anecdotal evidence train\" because it's still evidence.***\n\nI know an immigrant who came here and started working at a pizza place. He had no real skills, but he knew he wasn't going to get  government assistance so he got himself a job and did it well. Later he started doing tile and flooring work with no previous experience. He worked hard because he knew there was no safety net for him. He supported a family of three with an income of 28K and now they live better than some Americans who earn twice that. Why? Because his family has their priorities straight and knows how to manage money. I believe that is because they know that there is no one to take care of them.\n\nI also have a friend who owns a small business. She offers health insurance, retirement account benefits, and even tuition assistance for her employees. Very few take those offers, especially the last one. I would argue that the last one is the one most likely to help them get a better job, but people are lazy because of the entitlement culture here in the US. They truly believe that they deserve something for nothing. They think the world owes them something. I believe that this mentality is caused by welfare programs.\n\nOn a somewhat different note, I also believe that corporate welfare is just as terrible, if not worse. It props up businesses that should fail. It allows major corporations to make destructive decisions that can harm the whole economy. If any welfare were the end, this should be the first to go.\n\n\nResponse A Author: lobax\n\nResponse A: I have no real knowledge about the American public welfare system, so please pardon any eventual ignorance from my part. I'll try to argue from my experience as someone that was born in Brazil, spent my childhood in Guatemala, and then moved to Sweden at the age of ten, where I reside today. I have gone from living in a privileged position in a country with virtually **zero** public welfare, to a low-middle class on in the country that probably has the most extensive public welfare system in the world. \n\n\nIn a sense, you are right. It does make people feel entitled to what they consider to be fundamental rights, as virtue of being human. It makes people believe that no children should have a lesser opportunity in life based on the fact that they where born in the wrong family. It makes people outraged if a child should be denied a qualitative education, healthcare, or decent living conditions based on where they are born and what monetary means their parents happen to have. \n\nAnd in a sense, it also makes them lazy. Whilst I was attending school, peers of my same age with poorer families (often of mayan decent) in Guatemala would go from street light to street light doing circus tricks for money (a very common and vivid memory from my childhood) or helping their parents out in the field. In order for their families to survive, they had to work hard from the moment they where able to. One of the cleaning ladies at my mothers office, who later became a close friend of the family, only passed third grade. And she is not some isolated incident: as late is 2011, only [30%](http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/guatemala.htm) of those attending the primary level of education graduate from it. That's the drop-out rate for the high school level of education in Sweden. An education they are not only given for free (in Guatemala, this stops at year 6) - they are also given meals, books and transportation. \n\nIf society has a good, well functioning safety net, people don't have to only focus on surviving. They can send their kids to school, knowing that they will be fed a meal. If they get laid off, or have a bad year in the fields, they don't have to pull the kids from school in order to work. If there is guaranteed standard of living, children can realize their full potential, regardless of background. \n\nSo I believe that you are right - in a society without welfare, people are carved into rigid, strong individuals fending for themselves at young age in order to survive that harsh, dog eat dog world they live in. While we citizens of the nany state do not know how it is to work at young age, come to expect certain standards and become \"weaker\". \n\nThing is, I would much rather live in the later society. \n\n\nThis I must disagree with. According to this [study](http://martinprosperity.org/media/GCI%20Report%20Sep%202011.pdf), all four Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland) are consistently ranked among the top 10 nations in the world when it comes to Innovation, Technology, Talent, Research and \"Creative class share\" (whatever that is). Other countries with consistent top-10 placements in that list are the USA and Canada. That's no fluke. \n\n\nOr they simply like their current job. \n\nAlso, all forms of higher education are free in Scandinavia, and you are actually given handouts for studying. This does not mean that everyone will become a physicist at CERN, it only means that everyone has an equal opportunity to it. And isn't that what the American dream is supposed to be about? \n\n\nThey are paying it with their taxes, taxes they themselves have paid. It's not something for nothing - it's their hard work that lays the foundation for their social security.\n\nResponse B Author: daelyte\n\nResponse B: \"The problem isn\u2019t giving people money when they don\u2019t work ... it\u2019s taking it away when they do\" - Andrew Coyne\n\nThe wealthy get far more handouts than the poor. They support the system because it benefits them, not just out of the goodness of their hearts.\n\nPeople who are on welfare are there for a reason. When someone has to fend for themselves and can't, they don't \"become stronger\", they become homeless.\n\n\nGood for him, but some people also win the lottery. If he got hit by a car and couldn't work for 10 years, what would have happened to him and his family?\n\n\nIs it possible that there's other reasons they don't take it? Maybe they can't afford to stop working, for example? (a common reason why people don't study for a better job)\n\n\nI believe it's caused by the American Dream, the great expectations of becoming successful just for being in america. It attracts entitled people who think just because they were lucky enough to have a career or start a business without meeting any obstacles, that they got there through *hard work* and everyone else is just *lazy and entitled*.\n\n\nSometimes bailouts are necessary to prevent massive harm to the economy in the short term, IMO the error is when they turn into long-term \"solutions\" instead of getting phased out.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author lobax's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

That's a little over a hundred years ago. That seems like a while, but keep in mind that Native Americans were only considered US citizens in [1924](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Citizenship_Act_of_1924). If you read this article, you'll see that many states refused to give Native Americans rights even after this federal law was passed.

For people that would argue that, I would submit the argument that such scholarships do not exist just because slavery happened, but they exist because what happened during slavery and in the century following slavery hold significance even today. Like how because my grandparents were denied rights enjoyed by the grandparents of some white guy, they had fewer opportunities. And this lack of opportunity in black people back then has shaped the dynamic of today, and scholarships that are only for black people aim to help balance out any inequities caused by this shaping.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author rigoding90's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

It might even be an infinite number of assumptions.\n\nWhen that's the alternative, I will take *any* other explanation, even if it involves parallel universes.\n\nYET MORE EDIT: /u/sm0cc convinced me that this just depends on whether you're concerned with practical prediction-making, or the philosophical nature of reality.  At this point, I think my disagreements with modern physics have been resolved. :)\n\n----------------------------------------------\nOriginal post:\n\nAs I understand it, modern quantum physics claims that when a wavefunction is observed, it \"collapses\" into a single state.\n\nI believe that, if wavefunctions did *not* collapse, we would expect to make exactly the same observations.  Thus, the idea of \"wavefunction collapse\" is unnecessary, and violates Occam's razor.\n\nFor example, let's consider the Schrodinger's Cat experiment, but with one change:  The scientist has three switches in front of them.  They flip switch #1 if they see a live cat, #2 if they see a dead cat, and #3 if they see a half-live, half-dead cat, or a zombie cat, or two cats, or anything else that's out of the ordinary.\n\n**These three switches give us a way to tell what the scientist experiences.**  We don't have to try and interpret the wavefunction of their brain, because they will *tell* us what they experienced, using the switches.\n\nIf wavefunctions **do** collapse, we all know what happens:  They open the box, the cat collapses into either alive or dead, and the scientist flips either switch 1 or switch 2.\n\nIf the scientist repeats the experiment and tallies the results, they will (probably) end up with about half the tallies in column 1, half in column 2, and none in column 3.\n\nNow let's consider what happens if wavefunctions **don't** collapse.\n\nThe scientist opens the box and observes the superimposed cat.  Now we have a superimposed scientist:  The wavefunction is a superimposed version of a scientist observing a live cat, who flips switch #1, and a scientist observing a dead cat, who flips switch #2.\n\nBut here's the thing:  **Switch #3 remains unflipped**.  It is not superimposed, it is simply *off*, because no part of the wavefunction corresponded to a scientist flipping it.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the scientist did not experience anything out of the ordinary - remember, if they did, they would have flipped switch #3.\n\nWe can even imagine repeating the experiment, and the wavefunction will become many superimposed versions of the scientist, observing every possible outcome.  Most of these outcomes have roughly half the tallies in column 1 and half in column 2, but none have any tallies in column 3.\n\nSo, if we are the scientist, and wavefunctions don't collapse, we should expect to observe a live cat about half the time, and a dead one the other half.  \n\nWhich is exactly what we expected if wavefunctions **do** collapse.\n\nSo why should we postulate that wavefunctions collapse?  It wouldn't change what we expect to observe, so there is no possible way to gather evidence for it.\n\n\nResponse A Author: sm0cc\n\nResponse A: \n\n\n\nLet me see if I understand your problem. You want \"the laws of physics\" to give you a small set of rules to predict the result of any observation given sufficient initial conditions. This is reasonable. Your concern is that the Copenhagen interpretation requires assigning a non-deterministic mechanism to the deterministic evolution of the wave-function. The introduction of non-determinism precludes a finite set of rules for predicting the results of all observations.\n\nBut Many-Worlds really doesn't do you any better! You say you've done away with the mechanism that introduces non-determinism, but as a scientist I still have no deterministic set of rules for determining what I will measure in any given experiment. The 'branching' mechanism is fine philosophically, but how does this mechanism occur? Is there a deterministic rule for predicting which branch my experience will take in a given situation? How does MW explain that I only ever experience one branch?\n\nAs long as MW doesn't explain these things it's no better than Copenhagen, prediction-power-wise. I prefer Copenhagen, not because I'm more certain it's right, but because it's more upfront about it's shortcomings. We don't know what the connection between consciousness/experience and measurement is. Copenhagen says \"this is what seems to happen, let's treat it as a rule for now.\"\n\nResponse B Author: grapple25\n\nResponse B: How do you explain that we can observe the effects of superposition on quantum events but not macroscopic events? If the wave function does not collapse then it would just keep building up until it occurs at macroscopic levels. However, we can clearly see that quantum and macroscopic events are different. The double slit experiment would have different results if done with baseballs instead of electrons.

It forces people to associate with one of two extremes that are not clearly defined universally or objectively. Through traditional stereotypes of masculinity and femininity, gender creates a categorization of behaviors, qualities, and images as belonging either to men or women. Any man who aligns with the female gender or any woman who aligns with the male gender, then, is an an exception to the definition of a man or woman, as defined by society. \n\nSex and sexual orientation are the only concepts of importance. Although there are some rare exceptions, a person is classified biologically as either male or female. A man who assumes a feminine gendered identity is still a man and a woman who assumes a masculine gendered identity is still a woman regardless of their character or orientation.

A man has masculine properties as well as feminine ones, as does a woman. The concept of gender is to give a rough idea of the proportion of the two, which is why many people view gender as a spectrum rather than a binary thing.\n\nThis is even backed up by biology, with testosterone being the cause of most traits viewed as masculine, and estrogen being the cause of most traits viewed as feminine. Both chemicals exist in every person, and while men and women usually have more testosterone and estrogen respectively than the other chemical, that isn't always the case, and the exact ratio varies from person to person.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author BlueApple4's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Now note specifically I am talking about the non-violent kind of rape where neither member is injured physically, but express verbal consent still wasn't given or statutory rape where one member is too young to give consent.\n\nIt seems to me that in today's society, men are expected to want sex all the time. It's most obvious in cases where female teachers have sex with younger boys and peoples reaction to it (mostly) is 'NOICCE' or 'I wish this happened to me, my teacher was hot'. Then when it happens with the sexes reversed the reaction is mostly, 'That disgusting pedo deserves to get anally raped in jail' and 'Oh that poor girl, a terrible thing has been done to her'.\n\nAs a result of this, you come across a lot of men who have been technically raped but who simply get over it extremely quickly despite feeling dirty, violated etc as other guys around them just say stuff like 'You got laid dude quit complaining'. Essentially, society acts to minimise those bad feelings, allowing the man to move on quickly.\n\nHowever, when a woman gets raped, society's reaction amplifies these bad feelings to make the woman feel even worse. Society makes women feel they are now damaged, and a mark has been burned on them forever. This kind of thing is obvious in cases where a woman who initially thought a sexual encounter was just uncomfortable is now told she was raped. Society's general reaction to rape would only make the woman feel even worse about it, and not let her move on for a much longer time than for a man.\n\nI am not saying if I think either reaction is right or wrong, but it seems to be that way. So CMV, does society make female rape victims feel worse about it then they would otherwise?\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: bubi09\n\nResponse A: Just to make sure, you're saying that men get over rape more quickly than women because of the fact men are shamed with the whole \"man up\" thing?\n\nYou forgot about the other side of the coin when it comes to women - slut shaming and the whole \"what was she wearing, why did she go there alone, why did she drink\" deal. So the society also \"punishes\" female rape victims, just in a different way. \n\n\n I would disagree here. They hide it, which doesn't mean they're over it. I would go as far as to say that feeling shame makes the trauma worse (and this goes for women as well because they experience the same). So I would say the society makes it hard for men to be truthful and open which in turn makes them close down, not look for help and prolongs their misery. It's just that that misery happens in silence. \n\nAnd I think it's also important to say that this attitude is wrong and damaging, both when it comes to men and women. Victim blaming/shaming carries a lot of consequences and makes life harder, not easier. It doesn't mean the victim will just get over it; they will end up being even more traumatized. \n\n\nResponse B Author: gazork_chumble_spuzz\n\nResponse B: \nThis is where you are wrong. These men don't \"get over it extremely quickly\"...they just learn to STFU about it because it's evident that nobody believes them and nobody gives a shit. Rape is still seen in society as something that men do to women, or as something that happens in prisons. Rather than this being a *good* thing that helps men move on with their lives, it actually does the opposite. The fact that men are expected to always want sex is a *huge* detriment to male sexual assault/harassment/rape victims, because it leaves no room for consent - consent is irrelevant and unnecessary if men are merely mindless sex robots...but *they aren't*. This hurts men. They are far less likely to seek prosecution because nobody will believe them. They are far less likely to seek any kind of counseling/therapy to deal with what happened, because again, they assume that they will be met with more derision.\n\n\nThat feeling of being damaged is not a result of people trying to be supportive and saying how terrible the woman's experience was. It is a result of all the *other* people who ask her what she was wearing, or how much she had to drink, or whether she'd been \"leading him on\", or otherwise want to know how she could have prevented it and protected herself better. All that crap makes the victim feel worse because it all implies that the rape was somehow a natural result of something they did rather than being all the fault of the rapist. Also, when people go on and on about how huge of a problem false rape reports are - yes, that happens, but from what I understand false reports do not make up the bulk of all rape reports.\n\n\nThat, I will give you - I've seen women come onto forums and describe a sexual encounter, share that they are confused and feel weird about it, and be assured that \"if you even have to ask 'was I raped?' then it was rape!\" even though it really does not read like a rape account. I do think some people are too eager to label encounters \"rape\", and that can definitely make people feel worse than they need to. That's one of the reasons why I have already started teaching my kids the basic principle behind consent - it is your body, and you get to say NO. A lot of these situations seem like they're complicated because one person *felt* like they weren't into it and wanted to stop, but did not make that obvious to the other person, so things did not stop, and the next day they feel crappy about it...wouldn't that be solved easily if the person who wanted to stop just *said so* and made it clear? I think it is incredibly important for people to understand consent, *because* of situations like that. They need to understand that if you *feel* no, SAY NO.\n\nAnyway, so while there are things society definitely does to make rape victims feel worse, you have totally misunderstood what those things are.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author bubi09's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Yes, the types that get blitzed out of their minds are the easiest to spot around campus, and certain parties tend to be like that. But many, many other people like to go to more moderate parties where it's friends (and friends of friends) talking and having a few drinks. And maybe some dancing or singing to 80's songs. This can be a lot of fun, and does not result in \"Losing the ability of rational thinking, depending on it as a social lubricant, having lesser-than-average consensual sex, breaking things, hurting people physically\" like you are concerned about. I suggest trying this! I, too, was always turned off by the people who just drank crazy amounts and acted like idiots, but had some very good times at smaller parties with friends and a few drinks.\n\nModerate alcohol consumption (being mildly drunk) has been a part of many cultures for thousands of years. It would be a shame to write all that off without trying it a few times. Maybe it's for you, maybe it isn't, but trying it a few times is not dangerous.\n\nI knew a few people in middle/high school who were kind of grossed out about making out with the opposite sex. They were thinking about visually or clinically and it didn't make sense. But when they met the right person and it just kind of happened... oh, that's why people do this, it feels really good! My point is, some things just need to be experienced, you can't fairly evaluate them from the outside. Obviously I don't condone trying crack or heroin just to see what it's like, but having a few drinks with friends is pretty safe and worth a try.\n\nResponse B Author: Mavericgamer\n\nResponse B: I've seen this a few times, and it's always people who have only seen high school or college parties. Alcohol isn't what makes people at high school or college parties rowdy and raucous: what makes them rowdy is partly that they're in their teens and twenties, and that they are making it a point to get pretty freaking drunk.\n\nI didn't do much party drinking in HS or college; however, when I got my first \"adult\" job, I realized that office Christmas parties were a thing. There, it's less about getting drunk and more socializing with people you don't necessarily see all the time (I worked in IT and didn't associate with many people outside of IT unless I was fixing their computer) and some moderate drinking acted as a social lubricant to ease the anxieties associated with chatting with a room full of strangers.\n\nI don't want to encourage you to drink at HS parties, or even go to them if they make you uncomfortable, but I do think that you shouldn't write off drinking entirely until you've tried an office party environment. The people typically aren't snobbish a-la the high class parties (granted I'm American so I can't vouch for how different this is in Europe), and there is a moderation that is kept in check by the fact that you have to go work with these people the next day.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author justaguy394's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Currently we should be thankful that we live in a age that women can get safe and effective abortions with minimal damage. \n\nI think that if tomorrow an abortion ban were affected, that by the end of the day there will be just as many abortion clinics, but they will all move undergound.

So it really depends upon the type of penalty that would be associated with receiving an illegal abortion.\n\nIf you treat it like marijuana possession and levy a $50 fine for an illegal abortion, then you're right - it won't reduce the number of abortions much (if at all).\n\nBut if you consider abortion to be murder, and prosecute both the mother and the doctor (or other person) performing the abortion as murderers, then you're going to cut the number of abortions quite significantly.  Mothers would be looking at 20+ years in jail for an illegal abortion.  Doctors, who would likely be prosecuted like serial killers since no doctor performs just one abortion, would be facing life in prison or death.  You seriously think they aren't going to reconsider their decision to perform abortions with penalties like that?\n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: \nBanning abortion would reduce irresponsible pregnancy (not using protection), because of the fear of either having a child or getting harmed in an \"under-ground clinic\". \n\nMany people today are not very afraid of getting pregnant because \"they can always get an abortion\". This would not be the case if abortion was illegal. \n\nTherefore, overall abortion rates would go down. \n\n\n\nI believe that had to do with importing alcohol. You can't \"import\" an abortion clinic, or just create an abortion clinic like you could create alcohol. \n\nI'm sure there would be some, but making something illegal always drives down availability. \n\n\nIt won't stop abortions but it will certainly lower the number of abortions.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Russian_Surrender's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Many prefer the system the way it is. Many would like a more European system where server base wages are higher and tipping is rare and the amount insignificant, not realizing that this will simply increase the cost of the meal as a whole. Some just refuse to tip at all in an misguided attempt to *change the system* without realizing that they are doing nothing but penalizing the server.\n\nNow, a couple of advantages of my system: the first one being tax fraud. Having all gratuities on the bill would keep servers more honest about declaring their income.\n\nSecond, having gratuity on a separate line rather than absorbed in the cost of the meal would allow for negotiations on the tip in the event of abhorrent service. I suggest that the customer reserves the right to dispute the gratuity in extreme instances (the way it is done now with automatic gratuity for large parties, etc.)\n\nThird, it takes care of the folks that are simply cheap and want service without paying for it.

For instance, 25% is extremely high. If I'm going out for a casual lunch a 25% tip could make it quite an expensive meal. I'll usually tip 20, sometimes 15-18 if it wasn't good service. Also, how do you handle some of those in between restaurants where you don't exactly have a server but there is a wait staff?

You also suggest that this will make servers more honest, as the implication is that they routinely lie to the IRS in order to supplement their meagre wage.\n\nI think, as a European, that the whole gratuity argument is wrapped up in a somewhat American obsession with 'being served.' Although Americans seem to portray their culture as the ultimate in classless societies, there is a clear delineation between those who have and those who serve, and this is manifested in this fetish to be able to reward good service and penalise bad service as if you are employing your waiter as your own employee. To my eye, a fairer way to proceed if you have a problem with your service would be to withhold an optional gratuity and complain to the waiter's employer, as you would in any other walk of life. If the employer's response is not satisfactory, then do not patronise their establishment with your business. But I don't think you should unilaterally garnish the wages of those at the bottom of society in order to substantiate your delusion that you yourself are the master of this 'server' (again I think it's telling that the American 'server' is preferred to a more European 'waiter')Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author awesomeness0232's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

A tattoo will last you, on average, 60 to 80 years. Tattoos that are based in the current important state of affairs in your life will *not* be as applicable fifty years later, no matter how much you protest that the meaning is important, *you* will change, the circumstances of your life will change.

I mean that things that suit your body and underlying style will *always* suit you. Therefore, choosing to get tattooed with a design that is visually appealing to you, over and above the meaning of it, is a better bet for longevity of the artwork.\n\nMost people who \"decide the want a dolphin and pick it off the wall\" are doing it that way because a dolphin has some \"deep meaning\" to them; people who care more about the subject than the artwork tend to choose ready-made pieces. I have never seen someone come in looking \"just for something pretty\" and choose a pre-drawn piece of flash. Those people are ALWAYS the people who have some kind of spirit animal, deep meaning, symbolic reason for choosing that *subject matter* over the style and appearance of the art.\n\nAlso, *every tattoo has some personal meaning*. Even a purely abstract shape writ large, *means something* to that person- whether it's a simple adornment given to themselves as a gift or celebration, or a marker that they are owning their body- every tattoo has some meaning.\n\nIt's usually the small, unimaginative, ugly tattoos that people claim have the most important meaning for. And many people will try to cram as much meaning as possible into the smallest space- which is ridiculous really.\n\ntl:dr, ? People who get small, ugly tattoos are usually the ones who pretend to have \"meaning\" for them, and those people usually tire of looking at a reminder of their discarded past fifty years later; people who get beautiful, well-executed custom work often ascribe a different meaning to it as the years pass, and stay happy about their decision.\n\nResponse B Author: psychicsword\n\nResponse B: To me Tattoos is like the artwork hanging on the wall of your home.

My parent's walls are covered in paintings and photographs of sailboats simply because my dad likes sailboats but that doesn't mean he lives his life exclusively thinking about sailboats or he lacks creativity. It just means that he doesn't see the need to put messages in the artwork that he has placed his surroundings. A tattoo is no different except that it last longer and is with you all the time. \n\nI don't think a lack of meaning in someone's home art choices really can show a lack of creativity when it is only a single part of who they are. So yes maybe they got that butterfly because they thought it was pretty but they could be musicians or artists as well. There is nothing that says that we have to be serious about 100% of the things we do all the time.

I was chubby/fat for pretty much entire life until university, when I met a friend who happened to be your typical gym douche and... turned it all around.\n\nHe was very much into fat shaming and had no mercy towards people who say \"I can't lose weight.\" And I told him on quite a few occasions that it's honestly hard for people to lose weight and all sorts of crap about metabolic rate and how some people's bodies \"want\" to be a certain size.\n\nWell since he's also an amateur bodybuilder, he was bulking at the time. And one day, he lamented his abs disappearing and hitting almost 80kg. I had no abs, and I was almost 80kg, I actually had a very similar shape to him at that stage.\n\nAnd of course, he went on to talk about how it doesn't matter since after he cut down to 70kg, it'll all be worth it. And I thought, well fuck, I might as well give it a shot no? If I just copied him, how badly can it go wrong?\n\nLo and behold, I dropped 10kg in time for summer, I felt better than I ever had before, for the first time I felt like I was truly fulfilling my body's potential. I've even been hit on a number of times after that, damn!\n\nAnd here's where everything went downhill.\n\nI more or less hopped on the fate shaming bandwagon. I think the problem was that losing weight once I had the right tools and mindset was ridiculously easy. And it's easy to turn around say \"look at these pathetic people complaining about it being hard, hah!\"\n\nI see fat people trying to wear nice clothes and laugh silently at how futile it is. I see them in the gym and feel queasy about how weak they are. i see fat people talk about food/exercise/healthy living and I want to shoot myself.\n\nI almost always catch myself though and remind myself of where I had been, and not to be an asshole because there are lots of people who are where I was. But it gets harder and harder with time.\n\nThe more I hear fat people talk about \"but my genetics....\", \"my metabolism....\", \"I have a thyroid condition....\", \"I ate salad for two months but...\", or such excuses, it makes me mad with rage. And then there's the times when I hear \"But I don't want to look so bulky and disgusting with muscles\" or \"Running makes my ankles/calves hurt!\" I honestly want to punch these people in the face. Just bringing it up makes my blood boil so I think I'll stop myself here.\n\nI don't want to turn into a completely apathetic asshole and completely demonise fat people, but the more time that pass, the more I seem to be OK with that. The more time that pass, the more I see fat people who talk about their health as abominations akin to corrupt politicians talk about idealisms, the less I see them as people, the more I wish they would just give up going outside.\n\nThis is definitely not a healthy train of thought and it terrifies me that I can think this way, I need to change but I can't help being disgusted/disenchanted/disturbed by fat.\n\n**tldr:** Please convince me to not hate fat people.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: cicerothedog\n\nResponse A: As others have already mentioned, it does seem very much as if you're projecting.\n\nYou most likely have some rage and self-loathing still left over from being fat. You probably suffered defeat and humiliation while being fat. Even worse, you were overweight as a child and young person, the formative years of your life - that's bound to leave scars.\n\nSelf-loathing is the occupational disease of the obese. All our lives, we are being bombarded with beauty and health standards that most of us can never live up to. When we fail, we take the blame onto ourselves, and the downward spiral begins.\n\nThanks to a friend, you had the opportunity to reverse the spiral and change your life, but the little fat boy is still inside, and you hate his helplessness and insecurity, and what it's probably still doing to you in your daily life. But hating yourself with such fervor is very unproductive, even dangerous, so you project your hatred onto those who haven't had your good fortune and a friend to help and inspire them. He's probably also inspired your style of hate.\n\nWhat it all comes down to is that a person at peace with themselves does not hate. They don't have the need. Hate is always a defensive mechanism, born from defeat and fear.\n\nForgive the fat boy who used to be you. Allow yourself to feel sorry for him during his worst moments. Tell him it's not his fault. Because it actually isn't - he was only a child.\n\nI congratulate you with starting on the process of turning your life around. But the turn isn't really complete until you can look at someone who's where you used to be, and be supporting of them, instead of hating.\n\nFinally, I recommend a trip to YouTube. Watch the 3-part BBC series \"The Men Who Made Us Fat\". It's very enlightening when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind body-image and fat-hating.\n\nResponse B Author: BobHogan\n\nResponse B: The fat acceptance movement is harmful to people. It encourages them to accept their body and not try overly hard to change it, at the risk of their health (and even their lives in some extreme cases). But your post ignores that completely. You just hate fat people because you used to be one yet you found a way to lose weight. \n\nYes, physically it isn't hard to lose weight. But mentally is a different game. Once a person accepts that they can't, they can lose all motivation to even try. This is what makes it so difficult. A person will try to lose weight. Working out is hard, it can hurt (especially if you don't know what you are doing), and you don't see results right away. It is possible that all this amounts to discouraging people from even trying, and telling them to hate themselves for being fat does *not* help. \n\nShould fat people just accept their lot and not try to lose weight? No. Should you be allowed to hate them for this? No.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author cicerothedog's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

You've just arrived at the pearly gates of Biblical heaven. Everything is awesome. FUCKING awesome. As doctrinally promised, you retain more or less the physical form that you had on Earth, but obviously in its absolute peak, devoid of previous imperfections. Your mind, too, is better than it was before - much better. You can do whatever you want, in total bliss and comfort, surrounded by the creme de la creme, the best people who ever lived - not to mention your main man JC and The Big Man Upstairs. You're stoked. Eternity is going to be SWEET. \n\nFast-forward a thousand Earth years. You've been in Heaven a pretty long time now, but you're still having an awesome time. You've met a lot of people, but there's plenty more to meet. After all, on Earth there were around 3 billion Christians. Not all of them would have been good Christians, but even if only 1% of them did a good enough job to get into Heaven, that's still 30 million people, and surely the proportion of good Christians is more than 1%! Furthermore, since you all would have followed the Bible pretty closely, you're all going to have quite a lot in common, so you just know you're going to get on well with them. It's not just the people, of course. There's so much to enjoy in Heaven too! Anything you can imagine can be achieved, and as you're at your complete best ALL THE TIME, your imagination is working on overdrive! This is SWEET!\n\nNow fast-forward ten billion Earth years. Even operating at your absolute peak imagination, you ran out of original ideas for shit to do about (let's be generous here) 500,000 years after you arrived at the gates. That was 9 and a half billion years ago. You're really bored of your own mind, now. (Remember, the Bible promised you that YOU - that is, a semblance of the limited being that lived on earth and earned its way to heaven - would get to Heaven, so even in your Heavenly form, you must also be in some way limited). You get to share in the ideas of lots of other people too, though. Let's be SUPER generous here, and pretend that (even though you're all Christians, and therefore - at least to some degree - think in similar ways) each individual person has another 500,000 years worth of original material in their minds. After TEN BILLION YEARS, the thought of doing new stuff all the time isn't quite as fun as it used to be. You never get physically tired, or mentally 'drained' in the way a limited human being would on Earth. Even so, you are experiencing things similarly to how your Earthly self would have - that is, through your five senses and through your emotions (that's how the promise of Heaven is explained in the Bible, remember - as an extension of Earthly pleasures). The possible positive combinations that you can experience in these ways are starting to be exhausted. It's not quite so sweet anymore.\n\nNow fast forward a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion years. \n\nYou're still in a semblance of your Earthly form, still experiencing Heaven through a semblance of your Earthly mind. Nothing and nobody is new. Not only is it not new, but you've experienced everything so many trillions of times that pleasure, joy, and other positive emotions - no matter how Biblically epic - no longer have any meaning for you. Time means nothing. Other beings mean nothing (even God, who - according to the Bible - is so unknowable and infinite that He could never mean anything much to a human-ish mind to begin with). Again, you never physically or mentally tire in Heaven - those are clear Earthly limitations - so there is no sleep for you in a human sense. Which is a pity, because sleep would be a refuge from the only emotion you could possibly be experiencing at this time: boredom. Endless, unimaginable boredom. If only there was some way you could close your eyes and sleep forever, fade into nothingness. If only death were really real. The closest you can get to the comfort of nothingness - of death - is to float in an empty space, eyes closed, thinking of nothing. You especially try to avoid the one thought that claws at the back of your mind: the thought that, even after a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion years, you are not even 0.000000001% through your time in Heaven. You will literally be here for eternity. \n\nThis is the reality of the Christian afterlife as I understand it. In my view death - an infinite nothingness - would be way, way better. Change my view. \n\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: FreeBroccoli\n\nResponse A: I'm reminded of something I read from *Orthodoxy* by G. K. Chesterton:\n\n\nWhat I get out of this is that the ideas of being bored in immortality is a result of our mortality. When we're made new and no longer suffer fatigue or frailty, there's nothing to stop us from enjoying things every time we do them.\n\nAnother thing I'll add is that boredom is the brain's reaction to not learning; those activities we identify as \"fun\" are associated with learning new things. With an infinite amount of knowledge to be gained and no physical frailties to stop us, there's no reason we couldn't find new things to discover for eternity.\n\nResponse B Author: mak484\n\nResponse B: Is there any reason to believe time in heaven passes at the same rate as time on earth, if at all? Or that eternity is necessarily defined as an infinite amount of time?

My SO watches it and I've tried to watch the first two episodes but for one I couldn't \nget past watching Peter Dinklage. I have a pretty intense phobia of little people (aka Achondroplasiaphobia) and it gave me a lot of anxiety watching it.\n\nI thought maybe I could read the books first and perhaps I would enjoy the story line a lot and that way I would see past my fear and perhaps it could even be a step towards moving through it so I wouldn't be so debilitated from it. But then I see summaries of it and it just looks like a bunch of gore and sex. That really doesn't interest me. I like shows like AHS, United States of Tara, Buffy, and others (I can give more examples if needed). \n\nGore seems like a huge plot point of the show and that's another thing that doesn't catch me.

Don't read any summaries, don't watch the show, and avoid any discussions about anything other than what you have already finished.  Then just start reading the first book simply as a book.  It is extremely well written and engaging.  When things start to heat up it is truly thrilling.  TV will bombard you with the major tv selling points I am sure.

The big point of Martin's writing is the realism. It seems an odd thing to say for a fantasy series, but the people react as people *would* react in that circumstance. There's no legendary hero. They're just people. Little girls act like little girls, ambitious men as ambitious men, and soldiers do as soldiers do. The characters in the novel do more than just advance the plot. It's not Luke Skywalker being a hero, or Spiderman stepping up *again.* Westeros is a place, filled with fleshed out people. They panic, they crap themselves, they have sex, they cheat on their wives, they defend their ideals, they forsake their oaths, they *live.* I've read a lot of novels, of a variety of genre, and it's rare that the characters feel like people living lives instead of just characters in a story.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author cornball1111's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I however am mostly interested in learning about human beings. I want to understand what makes us tick, why we act the way we do, how can we figure out how to improve our lot. To pursue these kind of questions I find myself turning to the social sciences: Anthropology, Sociology, History, Psychology, and Economics. However I keep finding myself doubting their scientific rigour. I keep hearing about how unempirical these subjects are and how they are no better than wild guesses. I want to study things that are true, that are scientific! But at the same time I want to study human nature. I don\u2019t know what to believe. Sometimes I see brilliant people (Steven Pinker in particular) trying to apply good science to human kind. And other times I see less than credible claims about human nature about \u201cmen are from Mars and women are from Venus\u201d stuff.

Doing a psych experiment requires that you use humans, and there are no two who have had identical experiences.  But with good tests, and good controls, and repeatability and all that sort of good stuff, you can draw conclusions.\n\nNow, the scale of the topic can make things harder.  It's pretty easy to do the marshmallow test - will a toddler refrain from eating a marshmallow now based on the promise of two marshmallows later.  But to determine whether cutting taxes results in growth for low income workers is a hell of a lot more difficult.  You can't run a controlled experiment where the price of gas, and global market demand and regional conflicts and everything else stays the same so you can just see what happens because of taxes.  \n\nBut that doesn't mean you can't analyze the statistics and find trends that hold true in similar circumstances.\n\nBy all means, be skeptical of ALL research, whether in physical or social sciences.  Be aware of potential flaws.  But there is no doubt that we understand social sciences better now through research than we did years ago.\n\nResponse B Author: Madplato\n\nResponse B: The difference is that \"physical sciences\" study a static subject, while sciences preoccupied by social matters and human behaviors need to deal with ever changing variables. Humans change, the way we interact informs following interaction. We're kinda late to the party and we have a huge mess to untangle. \n\nThis does lead to a lot of \"hit and miss\", true, but it also provides valuable knowledge.

I really don't get why Monsanto is seen as such a danger, especially by farmers. I mean, yes, they are evil and shitty, but why do people work with them?\n\nI am a software developper, and an actor such as Microsoft is seen as a Big Bad Meanie in my industry. I'm not particularly fond of them, so i don't use any of their products, instead i go with open source software such as LibreOffice to get the job done. If i were to crack Microsoft Office and get caught, would i go to the media and blame Microsoft for being the bad guy when i actually stole their property to increase my productivity?\n\nTo me, it's the same with agriculture. If you feel branded closed-source seeds are a danger to biodiversity, then you have a large panel of endemic varieties that you can plant, re-plant, and modify as you wish. Why shackle yourself with seeds you have to buy every year, to only one producer who has absolute control over the pricing?\n\nMaybe it's because Monsanto seeds are more productive. Like, so much more productive that it covers the high cost of seed aquisition. In this case, why are people complaining? Again, in every industry, if you want to use closed tech to increase your productivity, then you have to pay for a license and you are not allowed to redistribute the tech because it is patented. Where in this case is Monsanto the bad guy? Do they somehow force agricultors to buy their shit?\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: Monsanto is very good at what they do and they are taking advantage of a flawed system, exacerbating the problem (and people lack of understanding... but ill get to this in a little). \n\nIntro: The problem lies in large scale monoculture, it is inherently unsustainable for soil health and, will quickly enough deplete the soil of N, P, or K (and tons of phytonutrients) as the soil depletes, the plants to be sustained by artificial means, fertilizer to grow, and pesticides to prevent them from being eaten. Monsanto, through round up and BT ready crops, allow this cycle to continue, further destroying the earth soil.\n\nSO: Monsanto allows large amounts of genetically modified food to be grown for cheap (because labor drops to nothing ,when it comes to grains especially). this has allowed GM food take on the vast majority of the food market with limited testing. It is worth noting here how difficult a long term food study would be, consider 60+  years on a population w/a controlled diet. the difficulty of doing this is incredible. \n\nto ansewr than the Q: \n\n\"Do they somehow force agricultors to buy their shit?\" the aswer is no BUT, the soil is so depleted, and would take a few (even if its 1-5) years to build up its health. in which time a famr can easily go into the red. and so the farmers have become DEPENDENT on their seeds and fertilizer which perpetuates the problem of needing Monsanto\n\nso to begin with, what I have stated above is unknown to most people, and food is grown for everyone. Furthermore, most people don't have a damn idea about how the food has ended up on their table, and Monsanto preys upon this. or rather other large food companies do, partner with Monsanto. Unilever etc wants large amounts of cheep modifiable grain (mind this grain &amp; corn is govt subsidized), this allows for big profit margins, and creates the impression that organic (non-Monsanto) food is unfairly expensive, when really non-organics are subsidized. anyway, back to the point, the majority of people are supporting, indirectly, Monsanto, and while farmer bob can choose a different set of seeds, that's only a tiny percentage . keep in mind farms are now BIG and require less labor, so peoples anger at Monsanto is that they are cornering the seed market and unless people wise up to it they will be in control of way to much of the food supply. \n\nwhich brings me to the next point,especially when Monsanto is playing with seeds that are unable to give functional offspring, these have, once again unknown consequences for the future (ie cross breeding with unmodified seeds).\n\nand that is why \"fuck monsanto.\"\n\nResponse B Author: Expl0sionDay\n\nResponse B: In my mind this is biotech companies is trying to enforce a new system that is not normal in farming. When you buy livestock and raise it, the person they purchased from does not get royalties for the calves. With patent law though you cannot do anything with those calves without paying licensing. Although if that is part of their contracts, then i see nothing wrong.\n\n The other aspect is how hard breeding is to control in. If Monsanto crops are planted near to a non Monsanto field, cross contamination can and inevitably will happen. It makes it harder than for farmers to plant non-gmo plants if that is there desire, and Mansanto has sued farmers for replanting fields found to have their genes even by accident.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_SchmeiserWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author [deleted]'s response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

As part of the agreement to use a company's highway, you agree to the rules of the road, and to follow the driving laws.

They've become a symbol of status in our culture, what with the expectation that you own a smartphone if you're anywhere in a professional setting. I remember an anecdote my father shared, where he was openly teased by his colleagues because he was still holding out on a dumbphone. It seems if you want to be taken seriously and mean business in the workforce, you need to own the latest pocketable supercomputers that are exponentially advancing in processing power faster than need be. What's the point of cramming all this powerful hardware into a device meant to be portable, only for all that processing power to never be fully and thoughtfully utilized by the majority of gadget users, and inversely drain battery life to the point of hindering users' potential volume of productivity?\n\nLet's face it: how many smartphone and tablet users actually demand that level of computing power? What tasks are they running that needs to utilize that power to the greatest extent possible? More important, will their tasks generate useful or meaningful output? If not, then why is one of the selling points of these gadgets their proclaimed facilitation of work productivity?\n\nThe reality of gadget usage should come as no surprise to anyone. They're used for trivial, privileging first-world tasks that prove to just be spoiling amenities. Don't deny it: we're not getting any useful work done with them. Take selfies and post to Facebook in less than 15 seconds? Send one another inappropriate faces on Snapchat? Browse the web (Reddit), text, and watch Netflix on the toilet? All these actions are possible in just a pocket away if you ever need to suppress the monotone boredom of visiting family, car trips, intellectual downtime, and, yes, going to the restroom.\n\nWhat people use their gadgets for can *certainly* be done on a laptop, a desktop, or the dreaded dumbphones! Even more usefully and productively! But we've all grown impatiently spoiled and we want that common functionality in any given instant in just a pocket away. Traditional computers and phones are old-fashioned and pedestrian; they aren't impressive when the same light functionalities can be done on a flashy touchscreen only inches long and millimeters thin!\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I'm not hating on gadgets. I'm rocking an LG Optimus V bought used on eBay for $32. But I don't use it as a *smartphone* so much as a dumbphone. All I need out of a phone is calling, texting, maybe the occasional picture taking. Used in conjunction with Google Voice, I basically have free service over WiFi. (Take that, monthly contract providers.) I'm probably getting greater battery life on this thing than on any dumbphone, because my tasks are so light on a relatively large battery. Couldn't have done all this without an Android running phone.\n\nMy gripe with the whole gadget deal is that we're whetting our appetites over inflating spec sheets when we don't even *require* such computing power nor can we be *truly* productive with them in the same way we can with traditional computers. And we're all willingly throwing our money at these big manufacturers, for gadgets that follow an inverse performance-productivity relationship. Tasks that can be done on a computer, should be done on a computer. Otherwise, it just looks like flashy pseudo high-tech when you're sending an email or browsing via phone when there's a more appropriate platform in front of you. \n\nTL;DR Gadgets aren't useful.\n\nI'm open to alternate views! CMV.\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: I'll preface this with my set up: I spent $600 on a Galaxy S4, 5$ on a good TPU case, $45 on a 64GB microSD card, $9 on a spare Anker battery, and I have a $70 month unlimited text, data, and calling plan with T-Mobile. I'll demonstrate not only why this is all justifiable, but necessary, particularly for me.\n\nI work landscaping and home renovation. It's not a typical white collar job one may think a smartphone is suited for, but I'll explain just how helpful it is, and perhaps that will give you some perspective:\n\n-I make texts and calls all day long. Supply runs, talking to customers, talking to my boss, talking to my co-workers, and generally keeping tabs on everything so that there are no missteps that cost more time, more money, or even put people in danger.\n\n-I use many landscaping and construction oriented apps. A smartphone for construction, the hell you say? Yup. Here's a few examples:\n\n[Planimeter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vistechprojects.planimeter): This app allows me to use GPS and trace the outline of a property and get an almost exact measurement of the square foot/meter space I'm dealing with. I'm sure you can get an idea of how useful this is; Ordering material for a fence? I know how much I'll need. Setting up an irrigation system? I know my limits and thus how much piping and materials will be required. It also helps keep property disputes from arising early on in a project, since I can have a customer look at the same mapping I am.\n\n[Handy Construction calculators](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sidetop.constructioncalc): I'm not really green in my line of work, but I'm no Michael Angelo either. This app allows me, at a glance to calculate materials, costs, and spacing I'll need for almost every aspect in Construction. It's more than a simple calculator, it replaces the usual pen and paper detailing that needs to be done to say the same thing.\n\n[Smart Tools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kr.aboy.tools&amp;feature=more_from_developer): I can leave the balancing meter, ruler, stud detector, and measuring tape behind. These apps replicate the results almost perfectly, and that means less crap to carry around and less items to worry will get lost or stolen.\n\n[Tiny Flashlight+LED](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devuni.flashlight&amp;feature=related_apps#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEwOSwiY29tLmRldnVuaS5mbGFzaGxpZ2h0Il0.): Why carry a flashlight anymore? Unless I need a powerful highbeam light, the LED on my phone works perfectly fine otherwise. Also has some cool effects like police lights/slow down lights (which I've used to signal co-workers at night), and text to morse code input.\n\n-Documents, Documents; paperwork out the ass. You know what cuts down paper and saves on cut down trees? A [PDF maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intsig.camscanner&amp;feature=top-free). Combine with some built-in office tools and document scanning apps I have on my S4, I've saved a lot of actual paper work and time and money. The best part is the multitude of ways to instantly share any of it and keep track of things with uploads to Dropbox or Google Drive ('ll elaborate more on that next).\n\n-Mobile cloud storage. Receipts that need to be saved and reimbursed for later? Why fill my car or a notebook full of hundred's of little papers, when I can simply take a picture and upload it to the cloud where my boss can see it instantly. I can also upload pictures/video of the property, the aforementioned documents, checks (that some Credit Unions will actually cash; dead serious), and backup any files that are kept in storage.\n\n-Mobile browsing and internet. This is a no brainer, naturally. Look up local listings, check certificates and corporate information, buy stuff instantly online, get in touch via e-mail and skype, check out the news, and generally enjoy having the collective knowledge of mankind at my fingertips. Not a bored moment, at work or in leisure. \n\n-Shopping! Smartphones are bringing the future and replacing our wallets. Thanks to the IR features on my S4, I can use an app called [Omnibeam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobeam.wallet&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd) that uses the IR proximity sensor on the phone to communicate with common retail store handheld/countertop scanners. I can beam loyalty/membership/gift cards instantly, as well as coupons. I have the Amazon shopping app as well since I have Amazon Prime and get free 2 day shipping on a lot of stuff, which is essential to my work. \n\nThere's also Google shopper, RetailMeNot, Groupon, and many other apps to instantly find out prices and product information, check out reviews, buy stuff, and save money. More phones are also coming with NFC built in, which is gradually replacing credit cards for fast payments.\n\n-GPS navigation. Turn-by-turn directions is handy for me since I'm always driving to new places and I can't realistically remember every new street or road I take. Additionally I can download maps for offline use, get my bearings even with no data connection or obvious landmarks, and track my phone if it gets lost or stolen.\n\n-Weather. It can make or break a day of work, it can slow a project down, and it can endanger people, especially on the coast and in Tornado Alley during Tornado season. There's a suite of weather apps and widgets you can add and get everything from radar to information on pressure. If your phone has a barometer like mine, you can even contribute to weather forecasting and get warnings about dramatic changes in pressure via [pressureNET](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.cumulonimbus.barometernetwork&amp;hl=en).\n\n-Note taking: Most modern flagship devices come stock with some great means of taking and sharing notes. My S4 has S-Memo for instance, but there's also 3rd party apps like Evernote and Voice recorder. Need to jot down some information, remember something for later, make a list, or just record some thoughts? It's all right there for you, and you can easily share it with others. Again, essential in my line of work, and in general.\n\n-Camera/Video. I have a Nikon D90 that I use for the \"WOW!\" shots I want. No question about it, it's a good investment when you work in landscaping. However with that said, it's a heavy beast, and it's very unwieldy. That's where my S4 comes in handy. It takes great pictures and video that are perfect for sharing and preserving 99% of what I do, and I get great software features like dual-shot/sports mode, as well as endless amounts of filters and touch-ups I can apply instantly. Also, anything I capture can be instantly uploaded to Dropbox or social media. If there's no internet connection, no problem. I have a 64GB SD card that will hold any pictures or video I take.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHonestly, mentioning all this stuff isn't even scratching the surface of everything I can do and do do with my smartphone. Watch media like Netflix/Hulu Plus, pump music at the gym, use the IR blaster on my phone to remotely control my camera, television, cable box, and projector, listen to police/firefighter/EMT scanners, watch my Blu-ray movies on the go, set up a dash cam/spy cam to record while I drive or record my property while I'm away, and so much more.\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nYou bring up things like laptops, dumbphones, regular cameras, handheld GPS units, etc. Let's face facts, a smartphone isn't the best at any one particular task. But that it performs thousands of tasks, any of which you can sync with other tasks for greater efficiency and results, and it does all of that while fitting in your hand and weighing so very little, is why people get smartphones.\n\nOn average, my phone plan costs me a little over $2 a day. Do I get more than $2 a day of value from my phone? Hell yes. In fact, my phone allows me to save easily more than $2 a day, thanks to time and money savings that I wouldn't have were it not for having a smartphone. The convenience added alone is worthwhile, and that includes the initital cost of the phone itself.\n\nThe best part is that you don't even need the latest and greatest device or the most souped up carrier service. You can buy an android device for $80-100 that is still a miracle of modern invention and a phone plan for $30 a month that will more than satisfy your needs. There's tons of content you can download and use even with no internet connection, and wifi is starting to take over for voice and texting.\n\nAnyways, I hope you get the point. I was like you; a bit cynical and generally dismissive of smartphones. I had a killer desktop computer and a laptop and a flip phone, who needs anything else? Dude, I was wrong. I was super wrong, and my only regret is that I didn't do my research sooner.\n\nResponse B Author: imightbealive\n\nResponse B: TLDR: Yeah, we could buy a small netbook, but why, when we already own computers (laptops, even), and the tablet or smartphone is so much more convenient?\n\nSmartphones aren't just for work, they're also for people who like power hungry apps like netflix and youtube. So even though they could make less powerful ones for work only, they still have to be powerful for those other users anyway. You get to use your little smartphone for work and home life, it's awesome! \n\n\nPersonally, I use a simple Net10 phone, all it does is text, call, and accept a minute refill card number. Yeah, real fancy. But if I could afford a smartphone, I'd buy one, if I didn't already have a tablet (it was a gift). \n\nMy mother barely knows how to use a TV or VCR (yeah, VCR), a programmable house phone except for using it like any old fashioned phone, hell, I mean, even on her cellphone, she inputs the numbers every time instead of using the contacts, even though my sister input every contact for her! :) \n\n\nI gave my mom my old laptop and it was sufficient for her needs, she learned it really, really quickly too, however a tablet is still much better for her. She likes her laptop a lot, she says she prefers it to the tablet, but she still uses the tablet more as it's more convenient. \n\nComputers are always getting problems. For this reason I installed linux for her and really locked it down. It worked great, and she loved it! But when she went back to our home country (splits her year between america and our home country because she has young grand children there), my brother didn't know how to use linux so  he replaced it with windows for her. So the computer became a fucking mess even though all she does is read and watch news! Not to mention she hates windows because it's so difficult to use, and she misses linux :P \n\n\nAnyway, the computer becoming a mess is not a problem with an android/iphone, anyone who's used them once can use it anytime again in any other device. Non techies can use it a lot more safely than computers without screwing it up. \n\n\n\nAnd she can bring the tablet to the kitchen when she's cooking, she can give the tablet to her grandchildren (toddlers) without worrying they'll break it. But she'd have to keep them away from the computer. She can bring the tablet upstairs to read news before bed without having to lug a laptop, mouse and power cord. She can push a button and it puts her on skype to talk to her family. And she loves facebook on it too, on the computer, she's always forgetting what she's supposed to click to see what the wants to see, but on the tablet it's a lot more intuitive to her.  With family so spread out nowadays, it's awesome for her to have skype and facebook on the tablet so she can stay in touch. The laptop was a pain to lug around so she rarely used went online to talk with family.\n\n\nIf you travel a lot  like my mom does, it's awesome not to have to bring something heavy and cumbersome like a laptop, and before you say it, if you're going to buy a tiny netbook you might as well use a tablet. And the tablet battery life lasts forever on her long flights. Oh, and laptops overheat and the parts gets older because of that, it's annoying and freaks her out (she says the laptop must be tired so she turns it off so it can cool down, pretty sensible for a computer illiterate person). For it not to overheat, she'd also have to bring a cooler! And she's older now, it's difficult for her to carry the luggage and all those things, a tablet doesn't really add more luggage, it just slips into her handbag. \n\n\n\nInstead of my husband bringing his laptop and cooler and every damn little peripheral everytime  he's out of town for work, he takes my tablet with him (he already has so many things to pack, his SUV is like a mobile home filled to the brim!). Specially when traveling overseas, bringing the tablet helped a lot as it was difficult for him in a different country without knowing the language. \n\n\nHe doesn't bring his laptop everywhere, but with a smarphone, if he needs directions, he can use google maps on the smartphone. A tablet and smartphone (free with calling plan) is a lot cheaper than buying a whole new laptop. And with laptops it's more cumbersome to sync data. \n\nIf he's out and about and someone from work calls to have him meet at a restaurant he hasn't heard of before, he can look it up on the browser. If he wants to find out the local fedex hours, he can look up the number on google, or look it up on the website. He can go on a retailer website and see if a product he needs right now is in stock, without calling or having to drive there to find out. If he's stuck somewhere because of bad weather, he has his phone to entertain himself, be it tv, game news, or whatever. And he can still check work emails and attachments so he can catch up by the time he gets to his laptop. I can email him a huge shopping list (we generally shop once per month) and he can buy the stuff before he gets home. He can look at a company information before he meets them.\n\nIf he had to do this stuff on a laptop... he just wouldn't get around to do it, ever. He'd just wait until he got home. \n\nI don't need a smart phone as I'm not really in social networks (hey, neither is he), and my work wouldn't really need it. And neither does his, but it helps him a lot. \n\n\nSpeaking of 17 inch screen, our apartment is small so I hate having a bulky desktop computer. So I bought a high spec gaming laptop as I need the power. That laptop is so heavy, and then there's the mouse, the external keyboard I use (nearly all the middle row keys on the laptop itself are busted because I type so hard and fast), the cooler, the headphones, holy shit, it's a mess and I nearly trip on all the cords if I try to move it around the house everytime I go outside in the backyard, to the living room, the bedroom, the kitchen, etc. \n\nSo if I'm not in the den, I take my tablet instead. I mean, I even put my tablet on the kitchen windowsill to watch movies or TV shows when I'm doing dishes (we don't have a dishwasher and don't have TV service, just a old CRT tv for the console games in the living room). I don't have to turn my head to look at the laptop or TV, the tablet stays put over the sink :) And it's easy to clean if I get grease or food bits on it when I'm cooking (I prop it up on the stove), I just wipe it off, but with a netbook I'd have to clean every little opening, gross!\n\nWhen a friend said they'd buy me a tablet, I thought the same as you and tried to convince him how stupid tablets are and that I don't want him to waste his money on one for me! Specially as I'm a linux tweaking freak who customizes everything little detail for her needs, and with a tablet I have very little choice on customization. But it's been really great to have the tablet! And I don't need two laptops, I just need one, a tablet is just for convenience, and you can still sync work documents and your personal media if you want.  I mean, you can even connect to your car speakers and listen to your podast or favorite song without bothering with CDs or a mp3 player. \n\nAnd with smartphones, you can just put the smartphone in your pocket and it will go to sleep. You'd have to turn off the laptop so it doesn't over heat in the carrier bag, and you'd have to bring a carrier bag ;) hell nooooo! \n\nYou can't just powerup your laptop when you go to a gas station to refill gas, or at the drive-thru to  buy a coffee and a donut. But a smartphone, you just touch the screen and check what you need to check, quick and easy. \n\nI'm generally a pretty big skeptic when it comes to fancy new convenience technology, but I can't deny how useful smartphones and tablets have been. \n\nI'm a person who never (ever) gets bored, I love not doing anything because I can use my own brain to entertain myself.  I could be locked up in a empty room for years and I'd still have a really fun time.  I still find the tablet very useful, so it's not just for people who get bored if they don't get spoonfed entertainment every 5 seconds, and as I said, I'm not on any social networks, and neither is my husband.

It's only a matter of time. Sorry for the text wall.** \n\nWell, let me add a caveat to my original statement. What I was trying to say was that it would be a much bigger deal if they were using this on a large scale to effectively entrap an average citizen.\n\n\nJust from the information in this article, it appears that they are using this for pretty serious crimes like very large smuggling operations of guns and drugs. And, while I personally still don't find this to be entirely kosher, its also not a surprise. If they were, for example, using this to profile an average person like you or me and then trying to entice us to commit crimes that we wouldn't normally commit I would have a much bigger problem with it. That would be entrapment. But, here, we're talking about people who are KNOWN to be committing serious and sometimes violent crimes on a regular basis and they're using the information to help catch them in the act.\n\n\nI tend to agree with this sentiment and I am fully aware that this is the start of a very slippery slope which could EASILY turn towards using it against people who haven't actually committed a crime yet (in a sort of Minority Report, pre-cognitive way). And, even more conspiratorial, I can imagine this becoming a tool in societal engineering in the sense that it could be used to stop political movements before they start. But, I am not convinced that this is actually happening... YET.\n\nSo, back to the original post concerning why people don't already massively protest this... it's because this is a very grey area that many people wouldn't have a problem with even if they knew for a fact that it was happening. As I said in another comment, this system still requires them to find traditionally admissible evidence with a warrant, they still have to do the grunt work after this guides them to the honey jar.\n\nI see some possible futures when it comes to the whole topic of secret surveillance in general.\n\n1. they get greedy, use this on lesser and lesser crimes and it eventually becomes so widely known that people become scared that its not 'just' drug dealers and gun runners anymore. This sparks more widespread outcries and activism and the public finally denounces it forcing it's power to be restricted or revoked.\n\n2. Law enforcement attempts to make this sort of evidence admissible in court publicly, a national debate ensues, and again the power of warrantless information is legally neutered due to public pressure.\n\nEither of these paths could end in two ways, peacefully or violently (as in not-so peaceful protests) BUT, I simply do not believe that the citizens of the United States or any other country will somehow continue to allow this to progress out of complacency or some crap like that. Take the civil rights movement, for example. The things that instigated the massive protests to end racial segregation were not small events, they were events that affected thousands of black people. People could SEE everyday that there were two bathrooms for blacks and whites, that they weren't allowed to get an education, that they were physically beaten and killed by police and even civilians, and that they were loudly and unsympathetically abused verbally all occurring over the course of years and years. It wasn't like one day everyone just said, 'ok enough, today we're gonna end racism'... it was a slow buildup of events and the voicing of opinions by MLK and hundreds of other social leaders that created an eloquent, logical, AND emotional foundation which opposed the discrimination that was occurring. They provided the guidance of why it was wrong, why the general public was REQUIRED to force a change, and gave them the belief that they COULD change it. \n\nNow, look at the surveillance issue. There has really only been one major event that was on par with something like a mass hanging or seeing someone beat to death and dragged behind a truck and that was the revelation of all the documents from Wikileaks/Snowden. That was the point at which the public at large became initially AWARE at all that this was even occurring while, previously, it would have sounded like every other conspiracy theory. At that point we had ground to stand on because we had hard evidence of this illegal and morally objectionable practice. Sure, it's been going on for a long time and many people have KNOWN that... but there was really no evidence to back it up previously. No one had been illegally detained (referring to Manning), no one had been forced to flee the country for being a whistle-blower (Julian Assange/Ed Snowden). Now, these things have been harped on by media outlets for YEARS. People have been forced now to put thought into it and we are starting to build a community of LEADERS who serve to maintain awareness and build confidence that something can be done about it.\n\nI know that this is long winded but I think it's important to contextualize what is going on by comparing it to previous issues that are somewhat similar. \n\n\nThree MAJOR societal leaders who were respected and outspoken were ASSASSINATED and this was after about 15 years of the unrest building and building. Unfortunately, this is what will most likely have to happen (or something on this scale) before real change occurs. I would love if massive political upheaval were quicker and easier to effect, but... its just not how it works.\n\nIt WILL happen eventually and many terrible things will likely be perpetrated when it comes to the surveillance state but we are really at the whim of inciting incidents to help motivate the citizenry. Without something to point at and a powerful, relatable leader like JFK or MLK to push the issue into the collective consciousness of the people, we will not see the major changes we are hoping for.\n\nAssange, Snowden and Manning started this thing but they, with all due respect, are not in a position to do what needs to be done beyond what they've already accomplished. They can't tour the country giving powerful speeches, they are not generally viewed as charismatic people, and they aren't even in the country anyway. **Occupy wall street failed because they didn't have strong leaders going for them.** JFK was the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MLK was a reverend and a speaker on par with the very best. Both revered members of society in the eyes of the general public. I can't think of a single person who fits that bill in the present day. Obama is clearly not that person, in fact, no politicians at all could hope to fill those shoes. I don't know who COULD live up to that challenge but it will happen. Something reprehensible will inevitably occur perpetrated by the NSA/Law Enforcement and it will be the tipping point, leaders will emerge naturally and organically. More and more ordinary people will start to be NOTICEABLY affected by this surveillance and the wave will break as it always has and always will. I am not worried at all that this apocalyptic, Orwellian nightmare will ever even come to pass. If it does, it will be quite short lived and met with the wrath of millions of people who simply won't accept it.\n\nIf you read all that then I TRULY appreciate it, I am very passionate about this topic and I only want to serve to provide a bit of confidence to people who are afraid that this will simply become the norm and we'll all just have to grin and bear it. I strongly believe that that will not be the case.\n\n\nThanks to those of you who commented\n\n\nResponse A Author: KerSan\n\nResponse A: [Have you ever read this comment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fv4r6/i_believe_the_government_should_be_allowed_to/caeb3pl)\n\nThe objection basically comes down to this: when people finally stand up to the government, it may be too late.

If a driver's reactions cause them to jerk aside or otherwise evade in a haphazard manner, might not the added moment taken to consider whether or not they'll be sued by the government impede their ability to avert disaster?  Finally, should we make aggressive driving *illegal*, or simply fine people for instances of it?  If we shouldn't jail people for aggressive driving, then we are accepting that aggressive driving, while problematic, is not such a problem that we must remove citizens from the streets, and therefore, the government doesn't need to be \"all up ons.\"\n\n\nDashcams are cheap, but bureaucracy is not.  A government program to ensure the purchase, registration, and maintenance of dashcasms will need to have jobs created, which require salaries, which taxpayers will pay.  Can you justify making the good driver pay for the mistakes of drivers he or she has nothing to do with? \n\nResponse B Author: BangGoesTheSilence\n\nResponse B: First off some people have a problem feeding their families and putting gas in their car let alone buying a dash cam no matter how cheap.  Second I can see how this could be easily abused by the police making winning a traffic dispute impossible.   This second point could be refuted by the fact that you shouldn't be violating traffic laws anyway.   And I would like to draw the similarity between the argument of the government monitoring everything we do on the Internet.   I may not be doing  anything illegal but I still don't like the idea of them seeing  everything.  It should be a personal choice.   There are definitely benefits to having a dashcam which you have listed.  But in the end people should not be forced to have one if the don't want one.  Of course insurances could force it and that might be a good idea but it shouldn't be the government creating legislation to force you to own one.

This could be a stay at home dad, foster parent, etc. I just used the term mother because that is usually the default term. \n\nPeople always tend to say that being a mother is such a difficult job. Even worse is when people say it is the hardest job in the world. I strictly disagree. \n\nCertainly, being a parent of any type is difficult as you are responsible for raising a child to be a responsible citizen. Any decision you make ultimately has an impact on how they turn out as an adult. \n\nHowever, it seems that as long as you are able to provide certain basic needs, they will generally end up as functioning adults. Most children just need basic things such as love and stability. Once you are able to provide those things, most of the job is just tedious and time consuming. Eventually everything just falls into a routine. This is especially true for the pre-adolescent ages before they are capable of taking certain responsibilities into their own hands. As they get older, the role of the parent starts to become less mandatory for their development and can even become harmful to the development of the child if there is too much involvement (ex. helicopter parents).\n\nThe actual difficulty just comes from figuring out what kind of strategy you want to utilize to raise your kid. After you figure that out, everything falls into order. Running the household while watching the kid turns into menial tasks such as cleaning up after them, picking up groceries, making sure they go to bed on time, controlling how much TV they watch, etc. None of these are particularly difficult, just time consuming. Thus, it is no more difficult than most other jobs that are just as time consuming and menial. \n\nTo say that this job is more difficult than say a brain surgeon would be unfair. A brain surgeon runs the risk of permanently screwing up a person for life with one wrong move of their scalpel. On top of that, in order to perform such surgery you need to train for years before you are anywhere close to being ready to operate. Where as being a mother just kind of happens and you are able to figure it out along the way. \n\nIn the event of children with extra needs, such as those with mental/physical handicaps, this certainly makes the role of being a parent more difficult in the day to day type of life. However, in the end everything comes down to routine once you figure out a strategy. In my view, I think one of the hardest parenting scenarios is having a child with extreme depression where there is a risk of suicide or self-harm. In this scenario there is not always much a parent can do because of the child's biological predisposition to their condition, and it can be even harder because their child could end up dead. While this may be emotionally straining on the parental figure, it still can not justify being a parent as the hardest job in the world, especially since most parents do not have to deal with this scenario. \n\nGo ahead, CMV. I'll make sure to award deltas to anyone who successfully does so. \n\n\nResponse A Author: hacksoncode\n\nResponse A: I think you're attacking a straw man.\n\nSome things no one means by this statement:\n\n1. It's the most complicated job.\n2. It's the most difficult job.\n3. It's the most physically exhausting job.\n4. It's the job requiring the most education.\n5. It's the most time-consuming job (though there's an argument there).\n\nWhat they mean is that the combined mental, emotional, physical, and time on-call toll that it takes on someone is the greatest, and that we're physiologically wired to make it the top priority in our lives (oxytocin is a bitch of a chemical, let me tell you). \n\nIt's pretty hard to argue about this if you haven't been a parent (which is not indicated in your post as far as I can tell). \n\nIt's exactly because no one is trained for it, and because it is so varied, and challenges come up at the craziest times, and it's a constant, constant, unremitting, never-any-time-off grind of a job that you can't just quit or take a break from if you get tired of it that makes it \"the hardest job\" to many people.\n\nSure, some people might find it a breeze. Others might just do a poor job at it and end up with crappy adults, and who cares? Well, not them, obviously. \n\nBut if you *do* care, it's very hard to find a job that completely takes over your life and changes it permanently the way that being a parent does. \n\nResponse B Author: Kishkyrie\n\nResponse B: Unpaid. Can't easily quit. Bodily fluids spew on you all the time. You're often isolated with illogical little people who want to watch the same movie twelve times in a row, ruin the walls if left alone for five minutes, and scream at the store because they don't understand why they can't have every toy in the aisle. And everyone in the store is staring at and judging you no matter what you do.\n\nThere's a reason parenthood (especially stay-at-home parenthood) is the last job in the world I'd ever take. I would *by far* prefer to be a neurosurgeon because at least I'd be surrounded by rational adults and people would generally respect me and my profession. People wouldn't offer so many unfounded and unsolicited opinions on my work. My spouse wouldn't make comments about how easy my job was and then expect me to cook a meal while they relaxed because they'd finished their 9-5 workday.\n\nI'm saying all this as a full-time childless worker who shudders at the idea of parenthood.\n\nThat said, I think the people who ordinarily make this claim (\"Being a parent is the hardest job in the world!\") aren't the ones making a heroic effort at parenting. They're the ones who thought parenting would be super-easy and they're annoyed because now they can only post on facebook fifty times a day.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author hacksoncode's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

In particular:\n\n- The months are uneven. It's confusing to have irregular fluctuations in the length of months. Only one month having 28 or 29 days? Alternating between =31 and &lt;31 days, only to reverse at August? There's no reason to have a complicated calendar just because some ancient emperors had oversized egos. 365 has few factors, so a perfect division is not practical, but we can at least do better than what we have: months 1-5 have 31 days, and months 6-12 have 30, for example (month 6 would get Leap Day).\n\n- Months do not line up with seasons. The equinoxes and solstices that define the seasons. Why have the season start 2/3 of the way through the month when they could just happen on the first or second, making that entire month in one season (or close enough)? It would also keep the months as part of division hierarchy: four seasons to a year, three months to a season. As a consequence of this change, the year also wouldn't start in the middle of winter. New Year's Day can be the first day of spring. *Edit* Based on some of the responses I've been getting, it seems like a lot of places use the term 'season' more colloquially, with summer just meaning 'when the days are longer and warmer' rather than 'the space between the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox. To clarify, this latter meaning is the one I've going by. Harvest, hunting, basketball, and tourist seasons are all regional, but the ones that relate to axial tilt are universal, as far as I can tell.\n\n~~- School and financial years are misaligned with calendar years. Why have the 2014-15 school year when one could make the entire year line up with the calendar?~~ This one has been answered; Financial years have no set times, and school years vary too much by region to try to align them with a universal calendar. View changed, in this respect.\n\nThese are the three particular objections I have. To change my view, explain why these problems are necessary, or at least why fixing them would cause other problems (apart from the practicality of adopting a new system to begin with).\n\nI am well aware that actually getting the world to adopt a new calendar is highly impractical, but such practical concerns are beside my point, so I don't intend to argue about that. I'm also not going to bother with appeals to tradition.\n\nSo change my view.\n\nThere's been some confusion regarding my intentions here. I am well aware that the costs of switching calendars would be huge, and not worthwhile for the relatively small benefits of having a more consistent system. However, if I allowed for that consideration when constructing my post, I wouldn't have bothered to post it because my view would have already been changed.\n\nThe basic question I'm interested in is this: are there good reasons to have any of the inconsistencies that the Gregorian calendar currently has? If we were to make a calendar from scratch, is there any reason to have irregular months rather than regular ones? Is there any reason to have the year start in the middle of winter rather than changing at the same time as a new season? These are the parts of this that I want to hear about, not whether it can be implemented.\n\nIf it helps you focus on the matter at hand, here's a rephrase: I have a button that, once pressed, will retroactively switch the current calendar to one with the \"fixes\" I describe above. This change is instant, seamless, and will carry no cost apart from the effort to press the button. Convince me not to press it.\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: klw\n\nResponse A: \nThe year is not actually 365 days long. It's 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 48 seconds long. Your \"perfect\" redivision would have to account for this. This is why leap years exist currently. An astrophysicist developed a new calendar with a pattern of 30 - 30 - 31 that repeats and then accounts for the \"extra time\" with a leap *week* in December every five or six years. This calendar is called the Hanke-Henry permanent calendar. Every single year would be identical. Christmas would always fall on a Sunday, for example. Your birthday would always be on the same day of the week in perpetuity. The pattern of 30-30-31 is pretty much a requirement (or some alternating pattern, at any rate) due to the way the solar year works.\n\n\nThe developer of the Hanke-Henry calendar states that the main reason to avoid changing the calendar is a psychological one. Many people would be very sad that their birthday would never fall on a nice, lazy Saturday, for example. His calendar contains four Friday the 13ths every year. The main reason to make the change is purely financial. Even the developer of the Hanke-Henry calendar claims that the Gregorian calendar is extremely accurate, and the only thing he truly dislikes about it is day-drift, meaning that April 1st isn't always a Tuesday or what-have-you. You can read more [here](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-it-time-to-overhaul/).\n\nResponse B Author: pretzelzetzel\n\nResponse B: \nAnd so you would change *the calendar*? Not, say, the timetable for the school year? School years are only weird like that in some places. In many others, a single school year actually *does* line up with a calendar year. In Korea, for example, the year starts in March and ends in December. They didn't need to change the fundamental way everybody had gotten used to reckoning the passage of time, though, in order to achieve this end.\n\nThat brings me to my main point: everybody is used to the Gregorian calendar. A more sensible calendar might be, like, a little better, but how much? Most people don't spend a lot of time doing the kind of calendar arithmetic that would be alleviated by moving to a slightly more intuitive calendar - which, as you admit yourself, still wouldn't be perfect since a full year is 365.24998798765 days long, or whatever the number is. If a calendar must be imperfect due to the very nature of the thing it's measuring, why would we want to change to a new one? How many yearly man-hours of productivity would be saved by the change? How many years would it take for that benefit to offset the enormous confusion that would surely accompany changing something as basic and common as the Gregorian calendar? Switching from Imperial to Metric, for example, made sense because 1. every number is base 10 so calculations are stupidly simply, and 2. it just makes goddamn sense. It's a perfectly rational system. The productivity benefits have long since overbalanced whatever productivity might have been lost to the initial confusion. Your calendar switch satisfies neither of those criteria.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author klw's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Stoners can't pay rent because they spend all their money on weed? You pay $10 to see a movie for 2 hours and a stoner pays $10 for a gram of weed to get high for 2 hours- I'm not sure I see much of a difference. What about spending money needlessly on alcohol?

With college level testing however; timing things like mathematics tests serve no purpose. College is supposed to train you for the real world and provide useful relative skills and a timed test is not one of them. If it takes you an hour to solve a single question but takes someone else 5 minutes that shouldn't matter because it translates very poorly into an actual work setting, where deadlines are more often than not several days off. \n\nI encourage you to change my view on the issue. \n \n\nResponse A Author: Indon_Dasani\n\nResponse A: The test timing isn't just for students - it's also supposed to be a guide for teachers, to dictate how much work should be put on a given test.\n\nIf students had 4 hours to take their tests, teachers would likely just give them work they expect to finish in 4 hours.

You don't want to see classes like that with the regulating element of time limits removed.\n\nClasses which have problems with most of their students finishing tests in a timely manner have a problem not in the timed-test system, but in the specific teacher who is failing to make a proper test.\n\nException, of course, for if the class covers a subject which is inherently difficult to do such tests for, like a speech class or something, and generally projects/presentations would be more appropriate for them than tests regardless of if they're timed or not.\n\nResponse B Author: inpowder45\n\nResponse B: \nI think multiple people have explained how that is just not true.

There is no other real use. They're impractical for any kind of hunting, for one. They aren't terribly accurate except at fairly close range. Their only real benefit is their portability and their easiness to conceal. This makes them perfectly designed specifically for killing human beings. In a pinch, maybe a 9mm can stun a bear for a few seconds, but if you're carrying a pistol, your intended target is definitely not an animal.

Someone who collects prohibition memorabilia has a reason to include a Colt Police .38 Special in their collection.

Change my view.\n\nOp: I was recently reading a reddit thread, and it inevitably spiraled into a discussion about gender politics (totally unrelated to the main topic of the thread). Assertions of \"Feminists hate all men\" and \"You don't understand Feminism\" abound, and it was basically par for the course, however, one post caught my attention: in attempt to show what radical feminism was capable of, a poster quoted from Robin Morgan's essay \"Lesbianism and Feminism: Synonyms or Contradictions?\" (April 4th, 1973) where she states, \"I feel that 'man-hating' is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.\"\n\nLet's forget about the first half of that sentence. Let's forget about feminism, racism, and discrimination as it pertains to our modern world. I'm not looking for you to change my view about what groups are oppressed or not. That being said, after thinking about it for a long time, I find \"that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them\" to be a perfectly reasonable statement.\n\nMy thought experiment was this: Let's say that everything that happened during the Nazi regime's rise to power happened except for the actual extermination of Jews in concentration camps. Let's say that Jews were used as scapegoats for social ills, deemed genetically inferior, forced to identify themselves publicly or face prosecution, excluded from business and politics and forced to live in ghettos. As a Jew in this scenario, would I not have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing me? If not, why? Is this an extreme example? Getting rid of the actually being mass-murdered thing makes me think it isn't so extreme, and more in line with the sentiment of this quote.\n\nWhat about African-Americans? I am not black, but the more I think about it, if I were, I think I would hate white people. Not individual white people, necessarily, but as a class that had actively oppressed my class for so long and (in some views) still continues to do so.\nAgain, I am not asking you to change my view about what classes are oppressed.

It is therefore natural to hate your oppressors for hating you but it is not healthy nor wise. Forgiveness is the only way to heal. The US civil rights movement achieved more in a shorter period of time than any other cause I've heard of. It wasn't accomplished through rioting or calls to treat the whites like the blacks had been treated. Those things happened but the focus was firmly situated on a peaceful movement. The wins came because nonviolent people made. A stand for rights while respecting the rights of others. They didn't try to enslave white people but free black people of that makes sense. \n\nOr the gay rights movement.  It isn't succeeding by attacking straight people and trying to take away their marriage and other rights.  It's about being honest and open about your sexual preferences and asking for acceptance. It is a campaign about love and understanding. \n\nIt's the twentieth anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. It is marked by forgiveness and attempts to heal the wounds of that brutal time. There was a story on npr about victims and their perpetrators in photos together as part of an exhibit where they are forgiving. Do these people have a right to hate? Probably. Is it Norma that they should hate? Of course. But if that hatred is allowed to seep in the fighting would never stop. Instead they learn to forgive and move on. It is a far more noble endeavor and far more effective at creating a better life for all. \n\nResponse B Author: SpydeTarrix\n\nResponse B: People have the right to hate whoever they darn well please for whatever reason they want. As long as they don't affect the other person with their hate. \n\nThe issue is if it helps anything. Sure, I bet it makes the oppressed group feel better, on some level.  But what good does that really do our society?  How is wallowing in the past going to help things in the present? If people are always down on themselves and other people for things that happened a long time ago, the present is only going to be made worse.  \n\nFixing current issues is important and that's what we should be focusing on.

You can't teach them a single thing about any chemicals, or biology when the child wouldn't know what bacteria is, microbiology (or the existence of it), or what a chemical is. *Maybe* physics wouldn't be so bad because of the math, but physics isn't really taught to kids until they are much older. \n\nResponse B Author: Raintee97\n\nResponse B: Upon further examination of your idea,\n\n Your first and second language idea is sound. Then again you need to figure out how you're doing your send language instruction. Are you going to go immersion? Then you will need to train and recruit the teachers that can do that. There are already some school experimenting with this. Some of my friends have their kids in Mandarin - English programs. Half the day is in English, the rest in Mandarin. You just need to make sure you would have the teachers to be able to do it. \n\n Math is sound as well. \n\n Philosophy is far too advanced, but history and basic information about science isn't. \n\nKids at that age tend to be a lot more concrete. They have a hard time grasping abstractions. they often learn about the world via what they can see and touch \n\n I would take out philosophy and include some type of art or science/ social science content. You don't want kids starting at grade five with no knowledge of those two areas. Arts are important, but of a lot of studies that support that arts help kids to develop parts of their brain.

I'm not sure if this view is common on reddit,  but I've heardit inreal life. I disagree. To me racism is when you see the color of someone's skin and immediately judge them, and classism is when you immediately judge people based on social class. When you see someone who is acting in a way to intentionally intimidate people or reject society, your judgement has nothing to do with the color of their skin or their social class, it has to do with their behavior, and there is nothing wrong with judging someone for their behavior. CMV.\n\nResponse A Author: GridReXX\n\nResponse A: I generally agree with you. I'm black. \n\nMy argument is that when you say things like that it makes people reconsider a few things about you. And one of those things is empathy or understanding. \n\nSomeone doesn't just ascribe to \"ghetto culture\". I mean sure some suburban kids imitate things they aren't. \n\nBut I'm discussing people actually born in impoverished urban environments that breed that culture. And what societal factors and institutional disenfranchisement helped to create that environment. More than likely they didn't ask to be born there. And more than likely their exposure is not yours. And what you're exposed to in your formative years shapes a hell of a lot about you. And in many cases you had no choice over that. \n\nAnd of course as you grow older and are exposed to different things you can change. But it takes a lot of effort to undue years and years of experience and values. \n\nAnyway that's what I can offer.

In reality, none of that is intended to \"intimidate people\" or to \"reject society\", it's simply cultural behavior that you're not used to, and that you've been trained by television to associate with a certain race and a certain lifestyle.   \n\nIn a lot of ways, it is very similar to the way that some British people traditionally looked at certain regional accents as \"lower class\" and assumed that people with those accents were less intelligent. That's simply not true, though; an accent or a dialect doesn't make you any more or less intelligent then anyone else, and to think that it does is classist and possibly racist, even if you don't realize it.  Same goes for style of music, style of clothing, ect.   You \"avoid it\" because you associate it with negative traits, when it actually has more to do with the culture and social class a person was brought up in.   Basically, you're associating negative traits with things that only correlate with a certain class, and don't actually correlate with \"rejection of society\" or whatever.

There was a time when this meant that conservatives were working in the interest of reducing government waste and lowering taxes for the sake of keeping people employed and the economy in motion. Today the republican party's fiscal policy is to increase the wealth of the richest Americans, under the presumption that this will grow the economy with \"trickle-down\" economics. This has never worked for the common people. It absolutely increases the total wealth of the US, but it shreds the income the working middle class.

The department of education is the most essential component of a functioning democracy, it creates informed voters and the future engines of the economy. Cutting the department of education is, in my opinion, the most near sighted and irresponsible economic decision which any ruling body could make, to deny the next generation the tools to succeed in their lives and run a functioning democracy. Democrats understand the responsibility of providing the next generation with the tools to achieve. I am not saying the democratic platform is perfect, I don't thing I even have the capacity to design a perfect platform, but it is worlds better than what republicans are proposing for our country. \n\nResponse B Author: SanityInAnarchy\n\nResponse B: Why are you one thing?\n\nI mean, you mentioned you're a fiscal conservative.

CMV\n\nOp: I'm somebody who normally orders Steaks done Medium, and even then I'll often have people telling me how wrong I am. Probably best that I don't tell them that I also like well done steak (if it's cooked right). And have you ever seen somebody on Reddit mention that they like Well-done Steak? Every time they will get torn to pieces by the \"Rare Master-Race\", without fail.\n\nIt just seems that people get way too wound up about steak more than almost any other foodstuff. Whatever happened to letting people eat their food the way they like it done? You don't have to approve of it, but it's not doing you any harm!\n\n\n**Not-so quick edit:** Some very good answers so far. Also some people I think might be members of the Rare Master-Race, but whatever. Just to clarify one thing; I do actually want my view changed. I'd like to be shown why Well Done steak is inherently worse than any other kind. That said, I'm still gonna eat Well-done steak because I like it.\n\n\n**Additional progress edit:** The points about the economical downsides of having your high quality steak well done are also quite good. Not as strong as the two aforementioned ones, but they've still given me something to think about.\n\nResponse A Author: maxpenny42\n\nResponse A: I'm gonna take a different tack and change your view about the uniqueness of steak as an evangelized food. Steak is not unique in having people so passionate about how or what you're eating. I don't eat seafood. I cannot tell you how often people have come to me and insisted I haven't had the right seafood. Try lobster or have you had crab? When I tell them I don't like fish and it all tastes like fish to me they insist I'm mistaken. People get downright offended that I don't eat seafood. \n\nHow about vegan ism. Certainly vegans are well know. For being preachy and obnoxious wen it comes to meat eaters food choices. But the opposite is also true. Tell someone you're vegan and omnivores will go out of their way to tell you your making a dietary mistake or grill you on how you get your protein and tell you you're doing it wrong. \n\nPick a food or a diet and someone has an opinion and if you make the mistake of saying no tomato on your sandwich you will get an earful of how wrong you are to not like raw tomato. That one happened just the other day. I picked tomatoes off a ore made sandwich I was eating and the lunch table devolved into the pro and anti tomato camps both sincerely insisting that the other was wrong. \n\nPeople are passionate about food and refuse to accept that tastes differ. If you want an example of food prep instead of just food stuffs generally consider eggs. I cannot tell you how often I've been called wrong for liking them scrambled and hating runny yoke. Like well done steak, scrambled is the ugly step child of eggs that every eg lover insists is incorrect and foolish waste of good eggs. \n\nResponse B Author: BricktopsTeeth\n\nResponse B: Eat what you want, but please don't order this at a restaurant. I've worked in food service since '98 and I've spent my time behind a grill. If you are eating with other people and you order a well-done steak, you have just delayed everyone's meal by at least 15 minutes. You've also caused the kitchen to break their rhythm, as a good chef will immediately begin cooking a well-done steak as soon as the ticket comes in, regardless if that ticket has 'fired' yet, likely causing a ripple effect of confusion and half-plated food in a busy kitchen. What you're essentially asking for in a properly cooked well-done steak is a single serving of roast made \"on the fly\". While this is perfectly doable, it's kind of like asking a heart-surgeon to change a tire during a bypass surgery. TL;DR: Eat well-done steaks every day if you like, but cook it at home.

It is nearly impossible to move a couch completely solo.\n\nThere are tasks that are larger than moving couches.

Sometimes, people can find ways off making money doing these things, and will form businesses.

When I walk down the street, the government stops (or tries to stop) anyone from shooting me and taking my stuff. I don't have to hire guards to protect my house 24/7 because breaking into it would be illegal.

Personal views on acting ability aside, I believe that the premise that the Matrix establishes is one that can only be rivaled by a few movies. The way the stories are told bring forth endless possibilities to the true nature of the film. I also believe that a lot of the hate towards the film comes from the inability to follow the overarching idea.\n\nI do not want to argue the execution of the film (i.e. cast, cgi quality, light use of cords). I only want to argue the structure and intent of the movie. Sequence of events and dialogue between characters are fair game, just not the actor's ability to show any emotion saying them. \n\nWhat I am asking is this, did the trilogy make philosophical or logical mistakes big enough that destroy the integrity of the film.\n_\n\n\nResponse A Author: subheight640\n\nResponse A: I really hated the pacing of the movies. I hated the actions sequences (which went on for way too long. I want more plot, less action damnit!)\n\nThe City of Zion's defense forces also left me shaking my head. Who the hell uses unarmored battle robots, with the obvious weakness of using some unarmored kids running about to reload them? Why the hell don't the evil robots have any sort of long ranged weaponry??? The weapons design is just awful in these movies!\n\n\nNot to mention, why the hell is the Matrix so complicated anyways? Why do they need a \"One\" to restart Zion again and again? Why don't they just kill the people that rejected the Matrix and let it be done with? \n\nSimilarly, on Neo's little mission to meet the Source, why the fuck didn't the robots just blow Neo out of the sky with a simple heat seeking missile that's not connected to the Matrix? Or if it was their intention to let Neo meet the \"Source\" all along, why waste a bunch of Sentinels?? I guess for the sake of pretty CGI? \n\n\nI dunno, I feel like the Matrix movies are just an overly complicated mess. The first was fine, because it was actually a pretty simple movie. But the 2nd and 3rd have too little time explaining why the hell things are going on, and too much time on weird sex parties, highway chases, and mediocre CGI. \n\nResponse B Author: nintynineninjas\n\nResponse B: Favorite set of movies, but I still think one great movie could be edited from the last two movies. \n\nI've seen the first matrix movie well over 200 times. I've lost count since going over 170. There are tons of great views and ideas in there that get just the right amount of \"handedness\". Beating someone over the head with a message is too much, lightly dusting will go unnoticed.\n\nThe core understanding was tied in with this philosophy in the first movie. The second two left it as a side dish, second to the action and plot line of a \"will they wont they\" survival story. Occasionally, we do get wonderful things like the Architect's well intended but... not poorly executed (lots of things you have to take into account that aren't spoken in a sequence able to be understood with a single viewing). \n\nThen again, slash out Trilogy and you've got a deal. The second, two part movie starts out wobbly, then you think it's got itself on track with the highway scene, and it all falls apart.

The Second Amendment was created with the intent to create a *well regulated* militia to defend from invasion and tyranny. The United States has come a long ways from the 1700's, and no nation could ever invade in this day and age due to the nuclear threat we pose and our massive army. I understand people keeping pistols for self defense, but why would any one need something like an AR-15, which is basically the same gun that the United States Military uses. why would anyone need a weapon like that in our day and age with advanced police forces and military. its not like you are going to be attacked by roving hoards of bandits. A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny, but I don't think that is possible in this day and age, as the modern US military would crush any resistance, as they have the best tanks in the world (try shooting an Abrams) and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America, as we have it far too good. in the end, i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment, as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability, as they have been used for horrible tragedies, such as Sandy Hook and Aurora \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Nixon_Cranium\n\nResponse A: No use for assault rifles you say? Tell that to the Korean Shop owners during the LA Riots The Riots were a prime example of why the Second Amendment is relevant in the modern world. The Police forces were unable to save people from murderous hordes who looted, burned, raped and savagely murdered random people. The Koreans banded together to protect their neighborhoods and stores from the hordes thereby forming militias I don't know about you, but defending my family, my livelihood and my neighbors from packs of bandits seems like a completely reasonable usage of a weapon made to kill humans, as frankly, we sometimes need to do that. if you have ethical prohibitions against killing, consider the following: the fact that the rifles used were primarily capable of holding high capacity magazines allowed the shop owners to fire warning shots, as the large ammo capacity gave them the privilege of being able to fire multiple rounds without reloading. if they had had bolt action rifles or say 5 round magazines, they would have made every shot be a kill, as you would not be able to waste any ammo. Incidents like the LA riots can be caused by natural disasters as well, see the looting that occurred in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina A good way to view an assault rifle is like a fire extinguisher. you might never have to use it, but wouldn't it be great to have it in the event that you really needed it? Also, \"Assault Rifles\" are far from a prolific murder [weapon](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table-20)  Have you ever heard of [Afghanistan?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan) The Soviets had a modern army and great numbers, and used absolutely brutal scorched earth tactics to try to kill off the resistance, but the Mujaheddin, tribal people who used small arms, homemade explosives and scavenged equipment staved off a brutal and vast army. It is true that the US government aided the resistance, but the Mujaheddin were able to hold their own against the might of a massive and powerful nation that scoffed at the idea of civilian casualties or [war crimes] (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSoviet_war_crimes&amp;ei=fmtgU8G-HYL4yQHO0YD4BQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFp3TV9cXuttOJ3IBFDlNafmp_sXA&amp;bvm=bv.65636070,d.aWc) if a revolt were to break out in the United States, I guarantee you it would not be a cut and dry game of blow- up-the-base.  The United States has been at war with Afghanistan for how many years now? In the event of civil war, defections would be areal thing, as many soldiers would not take kindly to the idea of killing civilians.\n\nResponse B Author: mc2222\n\nResponse B: The text in the 2nd amendment includes the words *shall not be infringed*.  This very clearly indicates it is *outside* the authority of the government to regulate how people keep and bear arms.\n\n\nTo be clear, are you proposing *nobody* is allowed weapons?  or just that *civilians* aren't allowed weapons.  The later poses quite the opportunity for tyranny - yes, even today.  We are not immune to it.\n\n\n\nan AR-15 could prove useful in situations like a riot (like the Rodney King riots, for example).  Additionally, the government should not be in the business of regulating things that are *not a necessity*.  It is not within the necessary powers of government to say \"that's not a necessity, so we won't allow you to own it'.\n\n\nThis is a very dangerous mindset, and having an unarmed populus would provide 'tyrants' with an upper hand (since it sounds like you're arguing that gov't officials and agents of the government would still have weapons).\n\n\nThey *can* be used to hurt others.  Or not.  They can sit on a shelf unused, or they can defend the safety of others.  It is tragically ironic that in situations like sandy hook and aurora, people immediately call the police, because the police...have...guns...  \n\nPolice stop crimes through show of force - forbidding civilians from doing this ensures criminals who *do* have guns, have a distinct advantage.  Any law that gives a survival advantage to people who break the law, is a *bad* law.  Or, put another way, a law that gives a survival *disadvantage* to those who follow it, is a bad law.\n\nThere must be a distinction between ownership of an object (no wrong has been committed), and actions *taken with* that object.  In my mind, ownership of something should not be illegal.  But, if you cause another person harm (with *any* object - a car, for example), *that's* when something illegal has been done, and that's when the law must intervene.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Nixon_Cranium's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Absolutely you should go vote even if you don't have a clue who's running. You should vote even if you hate everyone who is running. \n\nYou should do this for one simple reason. The people who are paid attention to in a democracy are the people who vote. In the US we can go and sign for a ballot and then not vote for any candidate. Do that if you really feel like you don't want to cast a clueless vote. Regardless make sure you go vote or else you are asking to be ignored by the system. \n\nVoting history is public record. Politicians keep their voting constituency in mind in everything they do. When they campaign, when they vote, hell even when deciding where to go for dinner. The one thing politicians care about more than power, money, or fame, are voters. Mostly because without their voters, they have no power. \n\nOne last thing that's a bit of a side note. Politicians target and spend most of their time on voters who they know will vote every time. 'Prime voter' is the term many campaigns use.  Of course a lot of people don't vote because like you said, they feel they don't know enough or haven't talked to a  candidate enough. Do you see where I'm going with this? It creates a catch 22 in where politicians never talk to people who don't vote and people don't vote because politicians never talk to them.

Even more to the point, you should make an informed decision, but for the moment I'll accept your premise. Other posters have done a good job outlining some practical reasons why you should still vote (things like making your demographic more influential). I want to perhaps address a fundamental reason, and that is that I believe it is your civil duty to vote.\n\nDuty is a word we don't see around very much anymore. It's not very popular in our modern age; we prefer to talk about our 'rights' and all the things we are owed, and not the things we ought to do. However, I personally find that in many cases it is helpful to re-cast all the rights we acknowledge as duties, or at least to realize that duties have a place along with rights in our conception of how people should behave. Now, why I prefer the duty-based ethic to a rights-based one is a long conversation and I don't really want to fully go into it here, mostly because here we are dealing less with an ethical issue and more a civic one. \n\nAs a citizen of your (democratic) country, you and basically a partner in a deal between you and your government. You are guaranteed certain rights and protections, and allowed to have a voice in the decision-making process. In return you agree not to break the laws that are created, and also you are expected to fulfill certain duties that are expected of you as a citizen. One of these, possibly the most important, is that you ought to vote. Only when people vote can the system really work. Otherwise politicians can get away with ignoring certain demographics, and all those other practical problems other posters have so clearly outlined. If you really feel you have no idea what's going on, or that none of the parties represent you, then you can always void your ballot. But it is your job as a citizen to get off your ass come election time and vote. No ifs, ands, or buts. I would also add to this that it is your job to stay informed, at least in broad terms, of the political process going on in your area/country.

He thinks that focusing solely on studying core classes such as mathematics, social sciences, and history is much more effective than wasting time with arts such as theater or music. He argues that the real world application of the core classes should be the only thing that is taught in schools as it is what gets you \"real jobs.\" Thanks in advance and CMV\n\nResponse A Author: jennerality\n\nResponse A: Well, while I would agree that arts programs do not prepare students for the \"real world\" in the way your colleague is implying (unless they are planning on being artists), this isn't a reason to cut arts from school. \n\nMuch of what we learn in high school does nothing to prepare us for the \"real world\" on the surface level unless you are specifically going to specialize in the subject. Most people don't use mathematics past the middle school or even elementary school level. History normally isn't that useful either in the future. A lot of careers do utilize English, but the large emphasis on literature is fairly unnecessary. Science might seem like it has a more concrete use, but not that many people pursue jobs that require the amount of science taught in high schools. Despite these reasons, you're not just allowed to take whatever you feel is relevant to you and graduate in a couple years.\n\nHigh school is not just about preparing yourself in a tangible way. It's about exploring your options and trying to do the things you like while you have no real obligations. It's about putting yourself in a mindset of learning and improvement. It's about developing your social skills to interact with peers and superiors. It's about absorbing and learning about culture. It's also about finding direction in life.\n\nStripping arts from high school would deprive students of a channel to fulfill some of these goals. Now, it's true that students can choose to pursue these activities outside of school, but many students are introduced to the arts through school or simply don't have the resources outside of public education. It's also true that other subjects have indirect positive effects (analyzing books improves critical thinking, history gives us context, we use both for cultural references, etc) but the same is true for arts (students who play music tend to do better on tests, arts are integral to our culture and many people would be quite miserable or even cannot live without them, etc).\n\nResponse B Author: Beloved_the_Fool\n\nResponse B: Real world application of the core subjects requires more than just the acquisition of knowledge, it requires the use of critical thinking, common sense and imagination, all traits of individuals. Study in the arts nurtures individualism i.e. self-expression and imagination, which are critical to developing new ideas from accumulated knowledge and experience as well as aiding in problem-solving, which is largely a creative skill. Furthermore participation in subjects such as music and theater help to develop cooperation and communication skills which cannot be learned nearly as well, if at all, in an academic class, and both skills are needed in abundance in order to make it in the real world.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author jennerality's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: To elaborate, I think the best way to pose this question is by looking at how it applies to video game culture. \n\nIf someone says, \"Yeah, you totally got raped,\" or \"Suck it, noobs,\" or even \"Get fucked, noobs,\" there certainly is the underlying literal meaning that someone is being defeated or humiliated via sexual assault of some kind. \n\nHowever, this is the literal meaning and not ever what actually happens in games. Nonetheless, these comments elicit a lot of anger and indignation from social justice advocates, in general, for contributing to rape culture or for trivializing rape. \n\nWhat I want to know is, if saying things like \"Suck my dick,\" to someone is considered violent, can we say the same for phrases that supposedly trivialize other kinds of violence and even death?\n\nFor example, someone might say after doing badly on an exam, \"Ugh, I'm gonna blow my brains out if I fail again,\" but they're not necessarily serious. There are quite a few people who do actually blow their brains out and commit suicide, leaving their friends and families devastated. I don't think that even people contemplating suicide, though, would necessarily find this phrase offensive or trivializing. We don't talk about \"suicide culture\" nearly as much as we lament rape culture. \n\nTherefore, I don't think we need to censor ourselves to such an extent. IF there is such a thing as rape culture, sexual trash talk is a symptom and ONLY a symptom of a bigger problem and cannot realistically be the cause of the perpetuation of rape culture (if it exists). \n\nI wish I could be more specific or cogent. I don't know if I would consider myself a feminist since the definition has become more and more ambiguous, lately. \n\nI truly am open to being proven wrong. I apologize if I've been insensitive but I figured ChangeMyView was one place I could ask these questions without feeling like a jerk. \n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts!\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Turtlegods\n\nResponse A: I think that something that does not come across clearly enough in your post is that you do not believe in the existence of rape culture. It is in your title and implied in your explanation of your position, however I think that addressing the topic of videogame culture and language is impossible unless we agree that rape culture does exist, and that it is a problem. To prove rape culture is a thing, I would like to link you to [/u/McLogan's post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i1kwj/i_dont_think_the_rape_culture_exists_cmv/cb02ml2)\n\nAssuming that rape culture does exist and is a problem (it shifts the blame of rape towards the victim and thus makes it harder to prevent future rapes), let's talk about your post.\n\nFirst, trash talk, jokes, and the use of language *in the examples you provided* are not the root cause of rape culture. They are, however, symptoms that exacerbate an already bad situation. More on that later.\n\nSecond, there is a fundamental difference between suicide and rape. The victim and the perpetrator for suicide are the same person, while for rape the perpetrator finds a victim/survivor.  In the latter case we have a relationship in which one party (the rapist) subjugates the other (the victim), making them powerless.  Because of this difference I think that suicide and rape, and their respective \"cultures\" are too good to be fruitfully compared. Let me know if you disagree or would like me to expand on this point more.\n\nThird, the problem with jokes and comments like \"I'm going to rape your ass\" or \"you totally got raped\" in the context of video games is that they trivialize the problem.  They make the act of reducing a human being to an object components of a game. It is no longer a serious topic, it is no longer a thing that happens to real people, but a figure of speech, a trivial happening. So by using this language we have a subtle association of the word \"rape\" with games, with when you're just having fun with your friends.  Of course you recognize, consciously, that rape is very different from the context of the words, but when it's used enough we become desensitized to the word and idea. Thus when see news article like the ones McLogan links to, we have more trouble seeing the problem. Instead we are more likely to fall back on jokes or dismiss it as \"another rape story\" instead of seeing the shameful victim blaming that creates the culture in the first place.  Trivialization doesn't create rape culture, but rather it allows it to flourish. \n3b. An interesting analogy here would be the phrase \"that's so gay\" in which \"gay\" becomes synonymous with \"bad\" or \"stupid.\"  Thus it becomes harder for an individual to come out as gay (and it becomes easier to see those individuals as \"lesser\") for fear of the connotation.  I would be interested to hear your thoughts on this comparison.  \n\nI can elaborate, and would love to, but I'd like to end by saying that I think that posts like this are exactly what CMV is for. You have a position that you think may be right but feel uncomfortable sharing, so you come here to talk to (hopefully) other smart people about it and see if we can learn from each other.  Also, if you're interested in femenism, I found [this great comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jt1u5/cmv_i_think_that_mens_rights_issues_are_the/cbi2m7a) on the topic earlier today. \n\nResponse B Author: jackalooz\n\nResponse B: A few points:\n\n1) Yes, misogynistic profanity is part of broader social misogyny.  But no, using this language still contributes to the collective issues.  You have to see it within the broader context of rape.  Around 85% of rapes are under reported in the U.S.  Using language of this type sends the message that rape isn't significant, and that it is okay to diminish it.\n\n2) Video game culture is already very misogynistic.  It's irresponsible to pretend that attitudes towards women in this growing subculture don't have a broader impact on society.  I understand that gamers tend to disconnect themselves while playing, after all they're just trying to enjoy a game.  But I think it undercuts the messaging that it sends to gamers, especially young ones, that women are sex objects and rape isn't a real problem.\n\n3) I understand your comparison to suicide jokes, but I don't think that's valid.  For one, suicides are far less common than rape.  One in six women in the U.S. have experienced rape (or an attempt).  Second, rape profanity is usually very aggressive and violent.  I think a more apt comparison is to profanity about homosexuality.  And if you think about it in this light, I think you'll see why it's viewed so negatively.  For the same reasons we shouldn't be calling people \"faggots\" anymore, we shouldn't be making jokes about rape.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Turtlegods's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I have had better sex and deeper connections; I am a more confident and honest person; I have much more respect and much less resentment of women. I have also made many women very happy and saved a lot of women a whole lot of trouble (by not getting too invested in them when they don't really want me.)\nThis morning, a former lover (who I am still very close friends with) sent me an article about how a \"seduction guide\" was removed from kickstarter, because it contained \"misogynistic material\" that promoted \"violence towards women.\" I think kickstarted and jezebel overreacted, but I would like to discuss.\nIn kickstarter's apology to the world, they cite this page from the reddit.

However, the people who subscribe to the seduction subreddit are \"nice guys,\" learning how to express themselves, so it's more complicated than just bad or good.\nThe fact of the matter is that sexual expression is complicated and confusing for young men like me, who have been taught deference and complete respect for their whole lives.

That being said, let me point out two things, I think, that (aside from the other examples given) are clearly misogynistic:\n\n* He clearly thinks that all the men who are reading this, no matter what their goals are, only view women as the means to a specific goal \u2013 that of being a person who is able to get around. In other words, relationships are important, but only important as an accessory. They are not in and of themselves actually important. The woman herself isn't important either. What the main goal for all the men reading, he assumes, is that they want to become this *kind* of person, and therefore the needs and wants of the woman are completely ignored.\n\n* This is a formula. The problem is that it assumes that ALL women are like this, as if all women are clone variants of each other, and that if you act in a certain way, there is no *logical* reason for women to reject your advances. That being put in the \"friend-zone\" is somehow a fault of yourself, as opposed to a girl saying, hey I'm not looking at you as dating material. In other words, it teaches that so long as you do x, y, and z, ALL women will fall for your advances.\n\nBoth of these points highlight how women, their needs, feelings, and in fact their very humanness is just not important. That's *the* cornerstone of misogyny \u2013 the idea that women are less or not human at all, that our wants, needs and desires are simply not important and/or irrational, and that we are all the same. I think this is what people have the most problems with.\n\nResponse B Author: Eh_Priori\n\nResponse B: So your argument is that misogynistic dating advice for men is okay in light of the fact that there is a major deficit in dating advice for men, and that \"nice guys\" can find help there?\n\nYes there is a deficit in dating advice for men and for now the seduction community is the only resource of decent size available (although there are other less misogynistic sources available), however, this does not justify nor atone for the misogynistic attitudes of the community. The advice is still misogynistic, even if it is helping people like you, because the possibility is always there that it could be non-misogynistic.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author piyochama's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

What changed my mind? Watching a real game (i.e. at a stadium, not on TV).\n\nIt helped that I was with a friend who was a supporter, and we had amazing seats right on the halfway line. And it also helped that the team we were watching (Arsenal) were on top form and had some great players (this was at the end of George Graham's reign).\n\nAs has been pointed out in other comments, it really helps to know what is going on in terms of tactics. What also may help is understanding the team, what role each player has and how certain formations work. For example, you will often see the players at the back, the defenders, forming a line across the pitch. When an opposing attacker is running towards them without the ball, they will move up as a line to try and trap him offside (i.e. if the ball is passed to him when he is beyond the last defender, he is then offside and play passes to the other team).\n\nAfter a while you start to notice how different teams play. Some will play a passing game, moving the ball between players until one sees an opening, where another player has made a run into space so that he is free to carry the ball forward. Other teams rely on tall players who are good in the air; they will hoof the ball towards these players in the hope they can win the ball and thus carry the play forward.\n\nA lot of this is much easier to see when you can view the entire pitch, unlike on TV where you have to follow what the camera is pointed at, with a much narrower field of view.  I hope this gives some insight into the intricacies of the game and the appeal it has for some people.\n\nResponse B Author: ryan_m\n\nResponse B: Clearly, you ARE missing something.  Part of the joy of watching sports is having an understanding of many of the strategies that are used in order to win games.

I honestly thought players just ran around doing whatever until someone passed the ball to them, at which point they'd shoot.  \n\nI finally decided to sit down and make an effort to learn about the game while watching it with a friend that understood it.  He explained to me the basic offensive plays (pick and roll, iso, etc.), and all of the sudden, it began to make sense.  Now that I could see the strategy at play, it became fun to watch.\n\nMy suggestion for you if you want to get into soccer is to do what I did: watch a few games with someone that has an understanding of it that is willing to walk you through it.

If you were to find a piece of media - whether it be a movie, game, piece of art, song - that perfectly appeals to you, it would necessarily not appeal as much to others. Hence the concept of cult phenomena. I'm sure there's plenty of evidence that fans of a cult hit are significantly more die-hard than fans of something widely popular.\n\nIf a piece of media appeals to everyone, then it must make compromises to each person's individual preferences in order to broaden the appeal. For example:\n\n- A movie being trimmed down to fit a PG-13 rating in order to include a younger audience usually means cutting back mature content which may have helped to enhance immersion and storytelling.\n\n- A piece of music that sits nicely into standard musical conventions will never appeal as much to you as a piece of music that violates those standards in a way that you personally find interesting.\n\n- A video game developer may focus their efforts on graphical power at the expense of gameplay in order to appeal to those who care more about graphics. This partially alienates their gameplay-focused audience.\n\nI feel like in general if something is ideal for you, it necessarily won't be ideal to everyone else. Each individual person can find large amounts of media that specifically caters to their needs, but it is impossible to universalize without compromising on these points.\n\nI genuinely feel as though people who listen to mainstream radio enjoy it, but not nearly as much as they would enjoy some artist that perfectly fits into their interests.\n\nObviously there are some people who's ideal media overlaps exactly with the mainstream, but these are few and far between. Everyone enjoying mainstream media would do better to search out lesser known content that appeals more specifically to their interests.\n\nI've had this debate with several people throughout the years but many people tend to disagree with me, however they have never brought up points that directly address my argument. I usually hear stuff like \"Well if everyone likes it, it must be the best\" etc.\n\nI have a very strange taste in media. I listen to really odd music, I enjoy strange films, basically things that are different and not traditionally popular. I don't like them *because* of this, but in spite of it. But this brings up this discussion time and time again and I felt like it was time to get reddit's input. \n\nI get accused of being a hipster due to this, but it's not as though I go out of my way to like things that are not widely known. However, I've learned over time that if something has been a smash hit the world over, it probably caters to too many different interests, and as a result is less interesting to me than it could have been. My main point here is that I feel this argument applies to everyone.\n\n**TL;DR:** If something appeals to everyone, it fails to completely satisfy each person's interests when lesser known, more esoteric content could.\n\nResponse A Author: sloggz\n\nResponse A: I agree in a very broad sense with your view, however I'd like to challenge something I think you've overlooked.\n\n\nWhen a peice of entertainment is extremly broad, to the point where everyone over the age of 12, of almost any language or culture can experience some sort of enjoyment in it, it can become a cultural phenomenon. For example, take the movies the Avengers, and Under the Skin. I enjoyed both of these films immensely, however, one is a deeply challenging artistic film that was hauntingly beautiful, and the other one featured the Hulk. \n\nNow, if I could only see one of those films over again, I would hands down choose the Avengers every time. Why? Because these days (and in all days) experiencing a piece of entertainment is more than just the two and a half hours of time I spent taking it in, it's experiencing everyone else taking it in as well. The reddit threads, the discussions in real life, the jokes, the interviews, the memes, the gifs. All of these are a part of that experience.\n\n\nEntertainment with widespread appeal leads to many more instances of sharing that experience with the world around me, which I greatly value.\n\nResponse B Author: gaviidae\n\nResponse B: I don't know that I agree that mass appeal means compromise but I don't want to argue that. Here's why I disagree with you:\n\nA movie that is geared towards you specifically is going to be something that only you see. You may enjoy it while you're watching it but when it's over it's over. You can't talk about it with others, you can't hear other's opinions about it, you don't get to enjoy memes, people look at you funny when you quote it. You lose out on the enjoyment of the shared experience.\n\nWhen a lot of people enjoy something they may enjoy the music a little less but it is more than made up for by the enjoyment they get out of sharing it with others. *Welcome to the Jungle* is a song I enjoy from my childhood. I loved listening to the song. But I enjoy it even more when it's me and 50,000 of my temporary best friends rocking out to it at a sporting event. If it was geared even more to me I would enjoy it more when I'm alone but I'd miss out on the enjoyment of it with a crowd.\n\nWe are social creatures and draw a great deal of enjoyment from sharing with other people. This more than compensates for any compromise we may make in order to have a larger audience.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author sloggz's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Rape has affected my the lives of those close to me multiple times, and I'm not looking to argue about anything besides the point in my title.**\n\nCalling someone a survivor of something implies that it is a potentially lethal thing.  For example, a plane crash survivor.  Everyone knows that plane crashes can and do kill people, so if you were in one and you didn't die, you are a survivor.  Rape doesn't kill people.  It is assumed you are a survivor of something that is nonlethal.  \"I got shot with a paintball gun, but I survived.  I'm a paintball survivor.\" This seems equally nonsensical. \n\nResponse A Author: cmv_throwaway1\n\nResponse A: I am a male, I was raped once by a teenage male when I was 8 years old.\n\nWhile I would normally call myself a victim, survivor is a good term to use too. Obviously it didn't outright kill me, but it is something I live with every day of my life. And if you are not careful, it is something that can take your life in a different way.\n\nIt scars you in a way that you can't get close to people anymore, I distrusted everyone, and the friendships and relationships I had with my family withered away and died for a while.\n\nThen I had to go through puberty, and I started having sexual desires and things of that nature. Having intimacy issues, trust issues, and sexuality issues really makes it difficult to start and maintain a loving relationship with a girlfriend.\n\nI think the core of person's life is love and relationships, love for your family, friends, and your SO, and to have good sex. Rape takes that all away from you, at least for me at did. And without that, life isn't much different from being dead.\n\nI survive it by ignoring that, going on with my life to love all the people I want to. Even if that burden is there to remind me every step of the way.\n\nResponse B Author: CrazyPlato\n\nResponse B: I think it may help to consider the definition of \"survivor\". Of course, it implies a form of death to be presented. A survivor gets close to death, and manages to recover.\n\nThat being said, maybe in this instance we can use a different form of death than literal, physical death. Rape is traumatic enough an action, that it leaves a substantial mark on victims. A scar like that will change you, on a very deep level. It may not come up often, maybe only as small things. Suddenly you get nervous about going outside after dark. You get distressed when you friends leave you alone, even for a moment. You can't bring yourself to confront people who offend you, out of an irrational fear that it may turn into a physical conflict. The point here is that an experience like that will reshape your very identity at times. In a way, the old \"you\" will die, replaced by this new, post-trauma \"you\".\n\nSo, then, you could consider a \"rape survivor\" someone who was a victim of rape, and by all reasonable judgement should carry that experience with them, should be a different person because of that burden they now have to endure, but is managing to recover, at least somewhat, and hold on to their identity from before it happened. Anyone who can find a way to be the same person after something like this is a survivor in my book.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author cmv_throwaway1's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

IMO it is natural for humans to be brutal and \"barbaric\". And that human kind as a total will probably never (or at least not in a long time) stray from the path of violence and brutality to a path of kindness and fairness because it is just a natural trait of humans to be brutal.\n\nGood examples to this are actually all the wars that have ever been fought.

History was my strongest class. I then studied social sciences and after graduating have been studying a lot of neuroscientific literature and studies. \n\nHumans are not brutal by nature, we are very complex beings. Our brains are incredibly adaptive to our surroundings and experiences and *most* of all to our culture. \nThe crimes commited in the concentration camps were commited under circumstances specifally designed to make them possible. Even the genocide in ruanda (which seems a lot more \"spontaneous\" on first glance) had very complex historical backgrounds and was incited very deliberately. \n\nI would argue the contrary: Humans are benevolent and social creatures, that are very capable of violence. \n\nThink about it. You are less likely to die of violence today, than ever before, why? Because we built our societies in ways that prevent violence more and more. Are we having setbacks? Of course! \n\nThousands of years ago, we had to use a lot more violence to survive. Hunt animals down and kill them, defend them against other humans (not brutal humans, *hungry* humans). But we always made our best efforts, to make everything safer and safer. We rebuilt and tried to make it better. And can you argue against the fact, that we have the most comfortable live (on average) today, than any generation before us? Why? Because we are brutal and uncivilzed? That does not make sense.\n\n\nResponse B Author: Mbututu\n\nResponse B: Of course the nazi's behaviour is a display of human natural behaviour as they were, in fact, human. Anything done by humans is human nature. \nWhich is to say, humanity's nature is to be extremely plastic. It can be capable of horrifying violence or extremely pacifistic. It can be capable of incredible destruction to a scale not seen by any other living organism in the same way it can choose to be protective of other beings that would have no chance of survival without it's presence. \nSaying that humans are by defintion brutal, just because of this, is quite shortsighted.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author ToggilSaram's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I understand that it's the most read book in world literature, and Christianity is the biggest religion. But a non-christian staying in a hotel can't really do much with it, aside from the aesthetic viewpoint (and although this is just my personal opinion, there are much better-written books than the Bible). I think the 'moral lessons' in the Bible can be found in tons of other great literature. Why not a Koran or a Tao Te Ching? Or why a religious book at all? I'd much prefer a greater variety of books, a Dracula in one room/hotel, a Ulysses, Crime and Punishment or Harry Potter in another.\n\nSo, try your best guys, convince me: why a bible over any other book?\n\n\nThank you, /u/GnosticGnome, /u/Cullpepper and /u/down42roads for informing me that it is not the hotel but a christian organization that provides these bibles. I had never heard of Gideons International. Someone should get a hundred million copies of The Hobbit together (thanks for the idea, /u/down42roads) so hotel goers can at least choose between two books to read :)\n\n\nResponse A Author: mobsem\n\nResponse A: My 2 cents besides the point of the Gideons which others have mentioned.\n\n\nYou've just said it. That there is reason enough to say that the decision is not arbitrary. It's simple numbers.\n\nAlso, you have to keep in mind that the relation people have with the bible is fundamentally different than most books (save the Qur'an, Adi Garanth, Book of Mormon, etc.). Even though many have read the Hobbit, I doubt they are likely to pick it up on a regular basis. I doubt that most bother to memorize specific passages. I doubt that when most are stressed that they run to read the Hobbit. Most importantly, I doubt many Hobbit fans would be grateful for the presence of the Hobbit in their hotel room regardless of their intent to read it.\n\nSo basically you have a book that means a ton to a lot of people (more than most people have for any secular book). As far as the other ones you listed, just look at the demographics of the US.\n\nMuslims: .8% of the population.\n\nTaoism: 56,000 adherents in the US.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States\n\nResponse B Author: Bynnar\n\nResponse B: Not sure if it's specifically US hotels or not, but the majority of the US is Christian. One book that you can guarantee would cause the least problems while simultaneously be readable/interesting for their customers would the Bible. Heck, Christianity even has a large chunk of the world population. As to why it is a religious book at all, again is probably because it's more practical since it's probably more likely to be read in general. People that are not bookworms would read it.\n\nBut my comment here is pretty arbitrary since as already pointed out, it is technically donated anyhow, so there is no reason to assume it was arbitrary to begin with.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author mobsem's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

For example, a XY who identifies as female is a MTF trans and vice versa. \n\n\nThat being said, sex is biologically deterministic and dependant on the appearance of the Y chromosome. Even if you have multiple chromosomes, such as XXY, or deficient, such as X0, the Y chromosome determines sex and therefore, anatomy. [To this date, there are no functioning uteri in MTF transexuals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_pregnancy) and FTM transexuals *can possibly* get pregnant. \n\nEspecially from a medical standpoint (and one striving for medical school), I don't want to (in the future) determine that the patient is possibly having a spontaneous abortion when all it turns out to be is a ruptured appendectomy (both emergencies, but diagnosis wise completely different).\n\nForms, especially medical ones, and other ID should have your biological sex on it, instead of gender to prevent such confusion.

I forgive you for not comprehending how significant the effects of hormone replacement therapy are, because the medical establishment has done a poor job researching this issue (not enough profit incentive). \n\nFor the majority of procedures and prescriptions that don't require removing my underwear, it is more appropriate that I receive the female specific treatment.  Again, this is because my hormonal sex is very important to my physiology.  \n\nLastly, I'll give you a social argument.  Most people see me as female and treat me as such, but if they somehow know that my birth sex is male that goes out the window.  They are likely to start misgendering me; medical professionals are especially grievous offenders, because you tend to think too highly of yourselves and your narrow educations.  Personally, I would rather waste a bit of your time talking to me about a pregnancy that I can't have, then to share with you private information unnecessarily that will cause you and your colleagues to view me as something I'm not.  \n\nResponse B Author: isleepinahammock\n\nResponse B: Things aren't so simple, even with regards to medical treatment. I'm trans female, at this point, my body is pretty much identical to a cisgender woman who's had a hysterectomy. \n\nDo I have a uterus? No, but my health needs are a lot different than males. People have mentioned medications on here, but many of these medications actually interact with hormone levels. I may have been born with a male sex, but I have been hormonally female for three and a half years. My cells have all adapted to female hormone levels and operate in an estrogen-dominated mode. If I have an \"M\" on my information, and you give me a medication that reacts badly to high estrogen levels, you're going to severely hurt me. \n\nAnd let's look at cancer risk. At this point I have zero chance of getting testicular or penile cancer. After years of bathing in female hormones, my chance of getting prostate cancer is and will remain almost zero. Now I can't get ovarian, uterine, or cervical cancer, my risk for breast cancer is similar to that of cisgender women.\n\nAnd finally, you mention that I won't be able to get pregnant, and this is true. However, when it comes time to have children, it is my hope that I'll be able to breastfeed. This is in many cases possible, and it is a connection I really hope to have with my children when the time comes.\n\nIn summary, the idea that trans people's sex is not so simple. In my case, my medical needs are actually much closer to women than they are to men.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author iyzie's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: First, I must say that the pursuit of better electric vehicles (henceforth denoted EV) is worthwhile.  As we find new and better ways to generate electricity, the EV will perhaps become the norm, so it makes sense to continue research and improvement on the cars, themselves. In this vein, some buyers may purchase EV's to deliberately give financial support to a budding technology, and that's great.  We will need nice, efficient vehicles to drive once everything else is worked out.  Those details that have not been worked out, however, create a dissonance in the idea of \"doing good\" by driving an EV.\n\nLet's take for granted all the energy that goes into creating an EV and maintaining its batteries.  I think there is probably a great argument that you'll never break even on the net energy poured into the production of a modern EV, but I want to ignore that aspect.   Let's say an EV just materializes, dropped off by aliens, perhaps.  With our current means of putting energy onto the electric grid, one may very well trade a gasoline powered vehicle for a coal powered one by choosing an EV, and that doesn't make much sense to me.  Alternative energies such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric need to comprise a much higher share of total energy production before running an EV can truly be considered a \"cleaner\" way to drive.  CMV--I am certainly willing to be informed otherwise.  (Edit=typo)\n\nResponse A Author: cwenham\n\nResponse A: Electric Cars can exploit an opportunity that's available right now, which is that we run so many fossil fuel generators for the grid not because they burn the cheapest sources of energy, but because those fuels are the only ones that can satisfy demands that are decoupled from the availability of alternate energy sources (such as wind and solar).\n\nI.E.: Fossil fuels can provide power even when the sun is down and the wind isn't blowing.\n\nIt's impractical to store grid power in a battery because it's too expensive: there's a 30-to-70% loss to heat for the charge/discharge cycle, and a battery that could store a night's worth of power for a medium city would be enormous (as big as a sports stadium) and expensive.\n\nFor the applications we use the grid for, it's more efficient to generate the electricity on-the-spot, as it's demanded, rather than pre-generate and store it. Some cities have the terrain to use [_Pumped Storage Hydroelectricity_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity) but it's still more expensive and is only used to bridge momentary supply shortfalls or demand spikes (such as when a popular TV show ends and everybody suddenly turns on the coffee maker. Or [tea kettle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTM2Ck6XWHg)).\n\nBut now we have these EVs, for which we've already justified the cost of those batteries. For a grid controller, it's like having your expensive, stadium-sized battery given to you for free. _Now_ you can let the solar and wind sources fill up those batteries whenever the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, and all the gasoline that would have gone into those cars is now available for the far more efficient turbines and generators of a power station.\n\nGasoline vehicles have a thermal efficiency of between [25-to-30%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_efficiency#Gasoline_.28petrol.29_engines), while fossil-fuel power stations typically get [33% efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil-fuel_power_station#Heat_into_mechanical_energy) or better. (Combined-cycle gas fired plants can get up to 60%)\n\nEvery person who trades their gasoline car for an EV today is effectively transferring the oil they would have burned at 25% efficiency to a power station that will burn it at 33%. Furthermore, if they live in an area that uses solar and wind, or they install their own photovoltaics, they become part of a system that gets progressively more efficient at utilizing intermittent sources of power.\n\n\n\n\nResponse B Author: disembodied_voice\n\nResponse B: \nQuantitative lifecycle analyses have been done into the lifecycle energy costs of EVs, and come out in favour of EVs.  The [UCLA](http://www.environment.ucla.edu/media_IOE/files/BatteryElectricVehicleLCA2012-rh-ptd.pdf), for example, found that a conventional car uses 858,154 megajoules of energy over its lifetime, while an electric car uses 506,988 MJ.  That's factoring in manufacturing of the car and battery, transportation, operation, and disposal, as well as replacement of 50% of the battery pack over the car's lifetime.  All things considered, electric cars come out to using 40% less energy over their lifetime.  This is because the electric motor is inherently more efficient than ICEs even after factoring in transmission losses, and there are a lot of hidden energy costs to turning petroleum into gasoline that are not immediately apparent to the driver.\n\nAs for emissions, they found that an electric car pollutes about 30% less over its lifetime based on the United States' aggregate power generation source mix, with that number changing to 50% for a relatively clean grid such as California's.  Even with coal accounting for about 40% of the US aggregate generation mix, the relatively low pollution of the other 60% mean that electric cars come out ahead.\n\nThe fact is, electric cars are already cleaner and use less energy over their lifetime, and will get even cleaner as the percentage of coal in the generation grid continues to decline.  More to the point, electric cars can draw on a wide variety of energy sources - no matter how hard you try, you'll never get a car to accept coal or nuclear power.  Our cheap oil has run out, and it's time to decouple oil from our transportation infrastructure.  Electric cars let us do just that, and by divorcing ourselves from an increasingly scarce commodity, it will ensure the continuity of automotive transportation, or at least mitigate the shock as we transition to a less transport-intensive society.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author cwenham's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

AS LONG AS we have freedom of speech and freedom of association, there is no need for a specified freedom of religion.\n\nThe only aspect of religion that is not covered by speech (belief and communications of that belief) or association (prayer meetings, etc) are things that are typically ruled against as being not allowed in modern society: polygamy, child abuse, stoning adulterers, preventing gay or interracial marriage, promotion of slavery, etc.\n\nI believe that a specified \"freedom of religion\" is antithetical to the idea of separation of church and state, and should be removed in favor of strong freedoms of speech and association.\n\n**As long as you are free to believe what you want, communicate that belief, and associate with like-minded believers, then why would you need a special addendum for religion?**\n\nIf you look at any historical case where freedom of religion was part of the trial, in every case that I've ever seen or read about, rulings in favor of the defendant were easily covered by freedom of speech and association.\n\nI don't have anything specific against religion in general, but I am concerned about things written into a constitution that appear to be there to circumvent freedom in the guise of protecting it.\n\nI'm open to my view being changed if you can show a situation worthy of protection in a free and democratic society where freedom of religion covers something that freedom of speech and association would not.

Examples would include vegan-ism, atheism, etc. This is the exact opposite direction in which I was originally headed, but my arguments to show religion wasn't all that important by comparing it to (for example) pacifism backfired and convinced me that just because a belief in God isn't involved doesn't mean the belief doesn't matter.

E.g. The US African embassy bombings, 9/11, Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, Chechnya, Kurdistan, Tamil insurgency in Sri Lanka, and yes, even the numerous deaths in Israel over the past 50 years can be faulted by the attackers on Israel's policies over the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nSo armed groups and terrorists will justify and believe their Israeli victims deserve it because of the same logic you have adopted.  That the victim is an accomplice of ongoing Israeli policies and are legitimate targets.\n\nResponse B Author: Badgerfest\n\nResponse B: The argument that a democratic country's population is a legitimate target because it is responsible for the actions of its government is flawed.  It was used to justify the bombing of centres of population in World War II, but more recently it has been used by terrorist organisations, especially Al Qaeda, to justify attacks on civilians including 9/11.\n\nIt has also been an argument used by Israel.  In 1982 Menachem Begin stated that Lebanese casualties of Israeli air raids were no different to those suffered by Denmark in Allied air raids in World War II.  As recently as 2006, Benjamin Netanyahu and Shimon Peres dismissed British criticism of air strikes in Lebanon by pointing out that Britain ought to understand Israel's actions as it mirrored the strategy used by Bomber Command in World War II.  He even specifically drew a link between ketyusha rockets launched at Israel and the German V2 programme.  There is a patent absurdity in this particular analogy, but there is no legal or ethical justification for the targeting of civilians.\n\nIsrael is party to all 4 Geneva Conventions, the fourth of which makes specific provision for the protection of civilians.  As well as requiring a country\u2019s actions to be proportionate, to discriminate between military and civilian facilities and to be humane, the fourth convention also states civilians are to be treated identically regardless of nationality, race, political opinion or religion.  So whilst there are questions to be asked about whether Israel\u2019s actions are proportionate, discriminate or humane, it is obvious that under international law a civilian cannot become a target based on their political choices.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Azarka's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: Let me start by saying I have not studied voluntarism theory but stumbled upon the concept while searching for an alternative to democracy that doesn't marginalize the losing voters. I will do my best to synthesize an explanation but this is not a highly researched opinion, so bear with me.\n\n1. **A democracy or republic, or any form of government that relies on elected officials to represent a populous, marginalizes the losers.** When you vote to elect your representative, you run the risk of being in the losing portion of the vote. When this happens your interests are not fairly represented as they should have been and you are effectively being taxed without representation. As an extension of this, even a perfect democracy fails the minority vote. It is nothing short of violence to impose the will of a larger body of individuals onto a smaller body. \n\n2. **A majority's ability to impose its will on a minority is virtually limitless.** \nIf all of \"The 99%\" wanted to impose a 99% tax rate on \"The 1%\" because they believe such a tax is justified, there would be little stopping them. This is probably the point most easily shown false, but the others stand without it.\n\n3. **Representatives are incapable of representing others, and cannot be trusted to make decisions on their behalf.** \nNobody represents a person's beliefs better than the individual himself. As an example, the Patriot Act is widely regarded as a failure to represent what is best for the people. This happens to be a failure that the vast majority of Americans agree on. How many would have voted in their senators knowing that this was the decision they would make? Democratic representation fails not only the losers, but the winners who were lied to on an official's campaign platform.\n\n4. **An individual can only be fairly represented by himself/herself.**\nBecause the smallest minority voter is the individual, decisions should be made on an individual, voluntary basis. Government has as much a responsibility to protect the minority as to do anything else we've come to rely on government for. Those who do not want to support, for example, universal health care (please note I am NOT referring to anything such as ACA Obamacare), or the invasion of a foreign country should have the ability to represent themselves on that stance and not be violently coerced into it.\n\n5. **Voluntarism is a peaceful solution to a violent practice.**\nSomeone who doesn't support involvement with Syria should not be forced to fund it. A government or people that uses force to exact their will on an individual a totalitarian government.\n\nPlease CMV. I've encountered a lot of people out there intent on doing so, but no good arguments.\n\n\nResponse A Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse A: Why can't we voluntarily consent to democratic government? I consent to the US government and to my elected representatives. Sometimes, I am in the minority on an issue or the politician I voted for loses. But I consented to that risk. I am not a victim because I voluntarily consent to this form of government.\n\nI realize there are practical problems of what to do when someone does not consent. But you are trying to force me to subscribe to voluntarism when I want the democratic republican government that we have now. I ought to be able to consent to that form of government even though it may be imperfect and sometimes I do not always get what I want. \n\nCan you explain further how voluntarism deals with a situation of someone who steals something and won't give it back or someone who constantly murders?\n\nResponse B Author: VitSasquatch\n\nResponse B: In regards to point #3/4, This is not an issue inherent with democracy. It is an issue inherent with representative government. A direct democracy, for instance, eliminates this issue entirely while being even more purely democratic than anything which currently exists on the planet. \n\nYour only real point against democracy itself is #1/2 (They may as well be the same thing), which can be true in some circumstances (such as religious zealots who will not allow their way of life to change, and therefore being oppressed when the minority and the will of the people does not agree with their own). But as most people will disagree with others on many issues, populations are seldom divided into 2 parts across a range of things to be voted on. The 'minority' you speak of will be composed of different people dependent on the issue. And thus people themselves will not be unequivocally marginalized, with very few exceptions.

All of history can be explained in terms of narrow self-interest. CMV.\n\nOp: Let me first clarify what I mean by \"self-interest\". I don't mean the tautologically true sense of \"Anything you want to do is in your self-interest because you gain pleasure by doing it.\" What I mean is:\n\n1. Maximizing one's material wealth and comfort\n2. Doing likewise for one's kin, according to [Hamilton's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection#Hamilton.27s_rule)\n\nMy claim is that the course of history can be explained entirely in terms of these two behaviors. Contrary behavior, such as altruistic concern for the well-being of others in general, is so rare as to be historically ineffective.\n\nLet me give a few examples of the types of explanations that I believe can be found for any historical phenomenon.\n\nQuestion: Why has the right to vote expanded to more and more people over the last few centuries?\n\n* Wrong answer: Enlightenment philosophies persuaded people that it didn't make sense to discriminate between people based on accidental characteristics. Over time, the sphere of humanity has expanded.\n* Right answer: Because wars are costly, whenever there's a dispute, it makes sense simply to count up the total number of potential soldiers on each side, and determine the larger side to be the victor. With the invention of guns, the military was no longer restricted to the elite; as technology advanced, more and more people could contribute to the hypothetical war effort, including poorer men and women.\n\nQuestion: Why did the American South retain slavery for longer than the North, until the Civil War forced them to abolish it?\n\n* Wrong answer: The North was more morally advanced than the South.\n* Right answer: Slavery was not profitable in the North's industrialized, skilled-labor-based economy, as it was in the South's agrarian economy.\n\nSo, to change my view: **Can you provide an example of a historical event or phenomenon that cannot be explained purely in terms of self-interest?**\n\nResponse A Author: Wild_Loose_Comma\n\nResponse A: The issue I have with this type of argument is that it is nigh un-disprovable. That doesn't necessarily mean its right, it just means that the intentions of people are so inherently subjective that to argue objectively about them is impossible. In the simplest terms you cannot ever prove someones true intentions. In a lot of ways, they may even not know their own intentions (ever done something and then immediately wondered why you did it?). \n\nI think the trap this kind of argument falls into is that, by definition, all actions *concern us*. As the perpetrators of the action we must have a reason for it and it will always effect us and the people around us. So it is incredibly easy to look at an action as an outsider and logic a way to argue \"self-interest\" when its more like \"self-concern\". \n\nDid Edward Snowden revealing the extent of online cyber watching provide him or his family with \"increased wealth or comfort\". Absolutely not. In fact they now have a target painted on them for the rest of their lives. You can argue ten different ways that it fits \"self-interest\" but I don't think any reasonable person would conclude that committing (in the eyes of) the largest government in the world would in any way maximize your comfort and wealth for you or anyone you've ever talked to.\n\nTL;DR: The solipscistic existence of man means it is impossible to ever truly understand other's true motives (if one can even understand their own) making this argument fundamentally impossible to prove. Because it is impossible to prove it boarders on meaningless to discuss.\n\nResponse B Author: ghotier\n\nResponse B: Do you have evidence that your view isn't a selection effect? Or maybe that's your point. It would seem that people whose ideology eventually led to their own benefit are more likely to be remembered by history than those whose ideology leads them to failure.

I find nothing ethically wrong with subjecting a condemned man to some measure of suffering before his death. If someone has killed another person by, say, raping and then burying their victim alive, what makes an hour or two of suffering on their way out so unacceptable?\n\nSince Reddit is largely liberal, I'd expect a healthy response, but let me clarify my position before rebuttals are made:\n\n1. My issue is with the ethics of inflicting pain before execution. I'm perfectly aware and agree that according to law anything more than a swift and painless death would be inhumane and therefore illegal.\n\n2. I'm also assuming that such additional suffering would be administered to admitted and unapologetic killers whose crimes were heinous enough to warrant such action. The uncertainty surrounding most court trials would be enough to keep me from supporting any actual policy for this.

Hurting someone doesn't mitigate or help to heal the suffering that they've caused in the past, it just compounds that suffering by causing even more suffering. Two instances of suffering can't actually cancel or balance each other out. \n\nYou might be tempted to invoke the \"scales of justice\" metaphor, but what you're proposing is only adding more weight to the side of the scale that represents the sum of awful shit people go through. Because even unapologetic killers, rapists, whatever are still people.\n\nI support criminal justice only to keep criminals from doing more harm, and to deter other potential criminals. Beyond that punishment has no instrinsic value in and of itself outside of immature, blood-thirsty imaginations.\n\nResponse B Author: frameddd\n\nResponse B: We've executed innocent people by mistake in the past.  We've also executed people for things we think are mundane by today's standards. Even today there's a huge racial bias in the execution counts for the same crime, indicating our justice system isn't as fair as we'd like it to be.

Some college students, like myself, normally eat foods that are minimally processed have great health benefits. When they go off to college and have to eat at a dining hall, they are restricted and forced to eat rather unhealthily compared to their normal lifestyle.

They should be consistently filled with grilled chicken, quinoa, brown rice, natural peanut butter, smoothie options, and REAL steamed vegetables.

Beyond choosing which company serves the meals, the administration has no say in what food is served, it's all up to the contracted company.

I don't know where to start...\n\nI'm a 25 year old white guy and straight, I've been single for about 2 years now and before that I was in a relationship for 4 and a half years. I think this is where I started to get bitter. I fell into depression after I broke up with her for sending messages to other guys suggesting she would met up with them for sex. I stumbled across some messages implying she already had but I have no solid evidence. I was a broken man at that point, I don't know how best to describe it, my inner self was shattered. I think I was like that for about 6-8 months but its hard to remember, all the days just blurred together. She had a new boyfriend in less than a week. I hated the fact that she could just be with someone else so soon more than I hated myself for being so God damn pathetic. I also hated that she told people that I was cheating on her and that I had \"other girls on the go the whole time\". I still had her on Facebook at this point and all the guys commenting where the guys she was sending messages to. \"Aw don't worry about it babe he was a dick anyway. Do you need a hug? ;)\" where among the comments she got, and it goes without saying that this brought my blood to boil.\n\nBut it isn't just her that has skewed my view on woman. My mother died when I was 8 and me and my older brother where raised by just my dad. As difficult a child I was he did the best job he could with me. It wasn't until about 2004/5 that he met Helen. She was a early 40 something year old nurse that lived about 50 miles away. She would come down every few weeks to see my dad and spend time with me and my brother. We knew right away that something was wrong with her but being so young we couldn't put our finger on it. After a few more months my dad asked us if it would be OK if she stayed with us all the time and move in, of course we didn't object because we could tell in the sound of his voice that he was lonely. Maybe he should have know better or maybe his heart was so desperate for love that he couldn't see that she was a fussy child that thought the universe revolved around, who knows? So when she moved in with us it was less than 6 months before she \"wanted to get a house that belongs to them\" and we were in a new home. I stayed with them until I was 19 and I moved in with my best friend and my girlfriend and I was glad to be gone. My dad had always been very firm but fair with us, never angry or over the top. As soon as we got in to the new house it all changed. It turns out that she didn't want to pay any of the mortgage that had been taken out in both their names. This lead to them arguing all the time. She (it seemed) just wanted to go to work, come home, relax and go shopping (and housework on the weekends only). I don't think that *Oh God its because she a woman that she is so lazy and won't take responsibility!* because it turns out that she was still living with her mum when she came to live with us and her mother still did everything for her. Make her meals, clean her clothes and didn't take any sort of rent from her. She was a stubborn teenager in an adults body. Now fast forward about 6 years, she cheats on my father and moves back into her mum's house. My dad also fell into another depression and stopped eating this time and starting drinking. It brought me to tears the first time I saw him a month after she left, he looked like a skeleton and he didn't even have the ability to smile. He told me that he got a letter from a solicitor of hers say that she wanted half of what the house they got was worth, about \u00a370,000 I think, even though she never paid a penny in to it. Its been sorted now and she is gone for good but over all this time I was losing more and more respect for woman.\n\nThen there is the only friend I have right now being controlled by his girlfriend. He has a son with his last girlfriend (who also cheated and left him in dept, funnily enough) and I have to say that he is the most incredible father you've ever met in your life. His son (5) loves him to bits and is so well behaved and respectful to him, nothing like I was when I was his age. He sees him 3 times a week and has him every other weekend, he sees his family, goes to parks and zoos and whatnot, he gets along with everyone, he loves life and daddy. The mother on the other hand, while providing him with everything he needs and I'm sure she is a brilliant mother to him, has decided to move in with her new boyfriend in a new house about 70 miles away, and there isn't anything my friend can do about it. The mother doesn't seem to care too much, \"He'll make new friends, you can see him through Skype, newboyfriend will be a father figure for him\" and yes, she actually said that. He broke down into tears with this, he loves his son more than anything in the world, and to be told by the mother that you can't see him as much and being powerless to stop it just fuels more of this sexist view I carry. The mother is moving at the start of the new year and she hasn't told her son and won't let my friend do it either, or \"I will just tell him that you knew he was going all along and that you didn't tell him\". I'm on the phone to him most nights trying my best to make him feel better however I can, but believe it or not, he only talks about his son moving away half the time. The other half is about how unsupportive his current girlfriend is being.\n\nNow, she is only 19 and she probably doesn't know how to support someone going through this. To be honest I don't know how either but I'm trying my best. From what he tells me she is just tired of him \"constantly going on about it\" and \"not even trying to cheer up\". She is the same as Helen is some respects, lives with boyfriend who pays most of the bills, always gets driven to and from work which his dad got for her and hates it when he spends a bit of money on something nice for himself. She very much has the *What's mine is mines and whats is yours is mine* attitude with everything they have. Shes spoilt, selfish and is making an already horrid situation worse by having a shitty attitude about it. She did the same on my birthday party a few weeks ago. We were all having a drink and dancing and having a good time when suddenly \"Why are you looking at that girls arse?\" comes from her mouth and the night was downhill from there. We all spent a few hours trying to get her to calm down but she was having none of it, *her* night had been ruined because he saw him \"staring\" at some other girl. Later in the night he punched him in the face but he couldn't do anything about it. He wasn't willing to tell some coppers we walked pasted because we knew she would lie and say it was the other way round and that she was the one who was punched or whatever, leading him into trouble (as Reddit keeps reminding me, happens *all the time*).\n\nWow, this is far too long. But all of these experiences combined make me look down on woman in general as just overgrown children. Plus stories on the front page are always woman screwing men over by lying then getting away with it just add fuel to the fire. [Its like a quote from Louis C.K](http://i.imgur.com/PVZ9t.jpg) Maybe I need more female friends, maybe I needed a strong female role model in life, but I need to change this toxic view I have. \n\n**TL;DR. I've had one too many bad experiences involving woman in my life and I hate the fact I can't trust one and find it difficult to respect them.**\n\nFor the love of God I'm begging you, please help me change my view.\n\n\nResponse A Author: eggies\n\nResponse A: \nWhat would happen if you were gay? Or if you were a straight woman? Most of the stories that you've included in your post have to do with romances running into trouble. If you have mainly straight male friends, and you and your friends mainly date women, then most of the villains in your romantic outlook are going to be women. But that's not because women are any better or worse than men -- it's just that women are the only people you're going to have romantic encounters with, and any bad romantic encounters you have must be with women.\n\nAdd to that the fact that you may have some unresolved stuff about your mother dying when you were young, and you have a life story that includes women who abandon you, or hurt you.\n\nIf you want that story to change -- and if you're a heterosexual man, you have a certain amount of happiness riding on the ability to leave the past behind and seek out healthy relationships with wonderful women -- you probably want to seek out some therapy. Work out what happened with your mother (maybe you got stuck in the anger part of the grieving process). Work out what happened with your ex -- everyone has an evil ex in their life, regardless of gender; having one doesn't make you a loser. Work out what happened with your father -- it sounds like he took some hard emotional knocks, and it doesn't sound like he dealt with them as gracefully as he might, which means that he probably wasn't able to teach you how to handle emotional matters as gracefully as you might.\n\nBasically, it sounds like you have a lot of shit to work through. I'm not sure that Internet strangers are going to be able to be of much help. I do know that a lot of times these things are kind of self fulfilling prophecies, and you'd be doing yourself a favor if you found a way to deal with the hurt and move on.\n\nResponse B Author: Diabolico\n\nResponse B: You love your dad, but your dad was bad at relationships.  He taught you to be bad at relationships.\n\nPeople who are bad at relationships are like wounded gazelles: they attract predators.\n\nThere are also women who are bad at relationships, and the male predators they attract are just as bad as the women you've dealt with (often more violent).\n\nYour job is to learn to recognize when you are unhappy in a relationship and get out.  A relationship isn't like a job: you don't need another one lined up for it to be a good idea to leave.  Being alone on purpose is way better than being in a shitty relationship by accident.  When you have the self-assurance to get out of a relationship with someone shitty, you'll be less likely to attract someone shitty in the first place.\n\nThat's the lay of the land, but I'd like to mention a few things in your story:\n\n\nGET OUT.  Jealousy is probably the single most toxic emotion in romantic relationships.  If a line of questioning about where you have been going and what you have been doing lasts more than a week, just cut the whole thing off.  Likewise, if you feel compelled to ask these questions of a partner, and the ordeal lasts more than a week, just cut it off.  This isn't an indication that anyone's suspicions are correct, only that one of you (either the cheater, or the false accuser, as reality bears it out) is not emotionally ready for the relationship.\n\nI'm advocating an extremely harsh metric here, and plenty of people would disagree with me, but I'm tailoring this to you, yes you, with the trust issues.\n\n\nThis is because your father was an overgrown child, and that is the kind of women he was attracted to.  You might also be an overgrown child, and are attracted to these women.\n\nIf you look specifically for women who are not overgrown children, you will discover plenty of them.  They will be interested in you so long as you are not an overgrown child.\n\nYou are living in the land of overgrown children, and all men and women in this land are overgrown children.  You will be less sexist when you realize that the men are exactly the same, but because you aren't trying to fuck them it doesn't bother you so much.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author eggies's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Thus, while you may not *meet* people who are both pro-life and sex-positive, it is not *logically impossible* or even improbable for them to exist. Given that there's such an even-ish divide between sex-positive/negative and pro-choice/pro-life, even with strong correlations between the views you should expect to see any mix of the two in at least *some* people.\n\nI'm sex-positive.

CMV.\n\nOp: ***Background***\n\nI enjoy discussing philosophy, but I increasingly feel that the philosophical questions lose their magic when you break them down critically.\n\nMy philosophical viewpoint rests on two premises that to me seem uncontroversial *(Edit: their controversy status is not central here; think of them as one metatheory that can lead to answers)*:\n\n- The human mind is an instinctive, emotional, stereotypic and subconscious machine, subject to [hundreds of cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) and prone to [hundreds of logical fallacies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies).\n\n- Materialism is the default position until evidence of the contrary is shown.\n\n---\n\n***Categories of fallacious trivialities***\n\nI contend that *philosophical questions in general* *(edit)* can be put into one or more of these five categories:\n\n**1.1.** The concept is a humanly conceptualized [prototype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory) without clearly definable boundaries. The question is as meaningful as \"at what shade does the color red cease to be red?\"\n\n**1.2.** The concept is an artifact of human intuition. Any reasoning will concern human subjectivity rather than the universe around us.\n\n**1.3.** The question is merely a semantic dispute or a syntax error.\n\n**2.** The question can easily be answered within materialistic (or otherwise Ockhamian) axioms. This does not denote absolute truth, but should be the default position.\n\n**3.** The question is ill-suited for philosophy. No amount of purely philosophical reasoning can *(be verified to)* bring one closer to the truth. *(Edit: I've conceded that it might be an arbitrary category.)*\n\n---\n\n***Evaluations of some \"[unsolved problems in philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_philosophy)\"***\n\n**Aesthetics - Essentialism:** *Are there essential properties that make a thing what it is?*\n\nSee **1.1**. It depends on if the thing is already defined by those essential properties. The roundness of a geometrical shape will determine how central it is to the \"circle\" *prototype*, but it can only have a binary relation to the \"perfect circle\" *definition*. Almost all physical things are prototypes of vastly different gradualities.\n\n*Does the quality of art correlate to its degree of organic form?*\n\nSee **1.2**. Even on a subjective basis, it's a very weak idea.\n\n**Aesthetics - Art objects:** *What is art?*\n\nSee **1.1**.\n\n**Epistemology - Gettier problem:** *Can knowledge be defined as justified true belief?*\n\nSee **1.1**. No, as Gettier shows.\n\n*What is knowledge?*\n\nSee **1.1**.\n\n**Epistemology - Molyneux problem:** *If a man born blind, and able to distinguish by touch between a cube and a globe, were made to see, could he now tell by sight which was the cube and which the globe, before he touched them?*\n\nSee **3**. The article itself mentions that this might not be an unsolved problem in philosophy, due to scientific studies.\n\n**Epistemology - Infinite regression:** *As it is impossible to satisfy the justification element due to infinite regression, can one truly have knowledge of anything?*\n\nSee **2**. No. Pragmatically, it doesn't matter.\n\n**Epistemology - M\u00fcnchhausen Trilemma:** *It is impossible to prove any certain truth even in fields such as logic and mathematics. The proof of any theory rests either on circular reasoning, infinite regress, or unproven axioms.*\n\nSee **2**. See the previous question: it's a trivial notion that nothing can be known with 100% certainty. However, a proposition can theoretically be true *within an axiomatic framework itself* (but you can't be 100% certain that you wrote that axiom five seconds ago).\n\n**Epistemology - Qualia:** *Is your blue the same as my blue?*\n\nSee **2** and **1.2**. If our brains are the same, then necessarily so.\n\n*Is a human experience inherently different from that of philosophical zombie or a sufficiently advanced AI?*\n\nSee **2** and **1.2**. No.\n\n**Ethics - Moral luck:** *A poor person is born into a poor family, and has no other way to feed himself so he steals his food. Another person, born into a very wealthy family, does very little but has ample food and does not need to steal to get it. Should the poor person be more morally blameworthy than the rich person?*\n\nSee **1.2**.\n\n**Philosophy of language - Moore's disbelief:** *A first-person present-tense sentence such as, \"It's raining but I don't believe that it is raining\" is paradoxical.*\n\nSee **1.3**. The full form \"I believe that it is raining, but I don't believe that it is raining\" is a trivial syntax error.\n\n**Philosophy of mathematics - Mathematical objects:** *What are numbers, sets, groups, points, etc.? Are they real objects or are they simply relationships that necessarily exist in all structures?*\n\nSee **2**. They are formal abstractions of the world around us -- not vice versa.\n\n**Metaphysics - Sorites paradox:** *Is a bale of hay still a bale of hay if you remove one straw? If so, is it still a bale of hay if you remove another straw (ad infinitum)?*\n\nSee **1.1**.\n\n**Metaphysics - Counterfactuals:** *What is meant when one asserts a conditional statement, the antecedent of which is contrary to fact? E.g. \"If Joseph Swan had not invented the modern incandescent light bulb, then someone else would have invented it anyway.\"*\n\nSee **1.3**.\n\n**Metaphysics - Material implication:** *In formal logic, the statement \"If today is Saturday, then 1+1=2\" is true; a causal or meaningful relation is not required. There is a discrepancy between material implication and the general conception of conditionals: is it an inadequacy in formal logic, an ambiguity of ordinary language, or no discrepancy?*\n\nValid question by itself, but see **3** and **1.2**.\n\n**Philosophy of mind - Mind-body problem:** *Is the mind separate from the physical body?*\n\nSee **1.2** and **2**. No.\n\n**Philosophy of mind - Cognition and AI:** *What are the criteria for intelligence?*\n\nSee **1.1**.\n\n*Is it possible to artificially create consciousness?*\n\nSee **2**. Theoretically yes.\n\n**Philosophy of mind - Hard problem of consciousness:** *Why is there a subjective component to experience?*\n\nSee **1.2** and **2**. *(Edit: personal hypothesis)* Short answer -- evolution. It seems clear that an organism with a conception of a coherent self-experience would have an evolutionary advantage. For how it actually arose, see **3**.\n\n**Philosophy of science - Problem of induction:** *(1) Any inductive statement (like the sun will rise tomorrow) can only be deductively shown if one assumes that nature is uniform. (2) The only way to show that nature is uniform is by using induction. Thus induction cannot be justified deductively.*\n\nSee **2**. Indeed, it's as previously mentioned a trivial notion that nothing can be known with 100% certainty. Pragmatically, it doesn't matter.\n\n**Philosophy of science - Demarcation problem:** *\"The problem of finding a criterion which would enable us to distinguish between the empirical sciences on the one hand, and mathematics and logic as well as \"metaphysical\" systems on the other\"*\n\nSee **1.2**. Mathematics and logic are not divine concepts, but rather useful human inventions based on axioms from what seems inductively obvious to us. Distinguishing between completely physical fields and completely abstract fields seems like the only possible answer. Human intuition might lead one to believe that there is a gradualness between physics and mathematics for example, but in reality, mathematics is a thoroughly abstract model of a study that is physical by definition. As for \"metaphysical systems\", see **2**.\n\n**Philosophy of science - Realism:** *Is there a world independent of human beliefs and representations?*\n\nSee **1.2** and **2**. The subjective reality is a model of the objective reality, filtered by cognitive and sensory limitations.\n\n---\n\n***Manner of discourse***\n\nI will give you a \u2206 if you:\n\n- Convince me that at least one of these questions (or some other question(s) of equal weight) is valid within the realm of philosophy.\n\n- Point out a considerable flaw somewhere in my reasoning.\n\n- Convince me in a logical manner that my view of philosophy is misguided.\n\nPlease refrain from fallacies such as these:\n\n- Appeal to authority: *\"Do you seriously think you know better than centuries of professional philosophers?\"* This is irrelevant to the veracity of the question.\n\n- Appeal to emotion: *\"Philosophy can be fun/intriguing/thought-provoking!\"* Certainly!\n\n- Appeal to influence: *\"Philosophy is important and has influenced a lot of fields and lead to great changes!\"* Absolutely! My question refers to the intellectual soundness of contemporary philosophy per se, among professionals and laypersons alike.\n\nCMV!\n\n\nResponse A Author: Froolow\n\nResponse A: Can I say to begin with that I really like the idea you had of stating under which conditions you will award a delta - it really helps shape the discussion towards the key points you want to be considered. If you don't mind a miniature appeal to authority, I work in a field where philosophical sophistication is absolutely paramount, and so I want to give you some examples of the kinds of questions I would have to answer on a daily basis, and perhaps we can move the argument forward by ascribing one or more of your 'fallacious trivialities' to these problems. I'll try and order them roughly in terms of 'most hard to assign a triviality' to 'least hard to assign a triviality'.\n\n* At what rate should we trade public health for individual liberties?\n\nI notice that - in general - your list is very light on political philosophy. Certainly, we could argue that 'individual liberty' is an artifact of human intuition, but I feel that this is an inadequate response - people's liberty *means* something to them, and professional philosophers have taken upon themselves the onerous task of describing exactly what that meaning is\n\n* Under what circumstances are people unable to meaningful consent to medical procedures?\n\nOnce again, people's capacity to consent *means* something to them. Even if you argue that consent is something which only exists in the context of a society (and I don't think this is true at all), it is absolutely a non-trivial problem to engage in meta-reasoning and describe the rules with which we ascribe consent\n\n* What does it mean for a patient to 'understand' the risks of a medical procedure?\n\n\nYou refute the question 'what is knowledge?' by arguing that it is nebulous, and without clear boundaries. OK, I think I agree (but for different reasons). However the question, \"Does X know/understand proposition Y?\" is different, and important, because it precisely probes the nature of those boundaries.\n\n* What is 'health'?\n\nYou'll probably hit this with a 1.1 objection (or maybe a 1.2). To a professional in my field, however, this isn't good enough; we have to be able to approximate 'health' mathematically, so the question becomes philosophically interesting once more - \"Is 'health' more like X or Y?\". Sure, this will be a product of human intuition, because it is precisely human intuition that we are interested in uncovering! And sure, the line between 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' will be a Sorities-type line, but the Sorites-type answers aren't appropriate here; we know what 'grains' are, just not what is a 'heap'. Here, we don't even know what 'health' is, or what the basic units of 'health' are.\n\n* \"Is choosing A the same as not-choosing B?\"\n\nIn other words, what ethical duty does the state discharge when a patient dies of something preventable which the state does not pay for? Did the state kill the patient, or did the state merely fail to save the patient? This is *vastly* important in medical malpractice law, and hence *becomes* important in professional philosophy. It also feeds into the debate on abortion. You discharge 'moral luck' with a 1.2 objection, but this is something sightly more subtle - it doesn't matter what our intuitions are because the state can always adjust what it pays for in order to keep in line with our intuitions about what the state is right to do. What matters is that we as a society appear not even to know what our intuitions *are*, and discovering these is a non-trivial philosophical problem.\n\n* Is it right that the NHS saves only UK lives when it could save a greater number of lives/\u00a3 if it transplanted itself into Syria, for example?\n\nA political philosophy question to end with - what is the role of the state? I guess you could dismiss this as a 1.1 or a 1.2, but that would suggest to me that you miss the nuances of political philosophy - nobody cares what the state *is*, they just care about where and how it should exercise it's power to cope with all possible configurations of the human conditions (cf Rawls). On the other hand, maybe *I* can't see the wood for the trees, and you're right to dismiss it!\n\nSo my suggestion is that you pick a couple of the (to you) most philosophically interesting questions I have raised and refute my contention that they are meaningful (non-trivial) if you are able.\n\nI hope you don't misconstrue this as an appeal to influence - philosophy obviously influences the field of healthcare dramatically, but these are philosophical problems endemic in the field, not merely classical problems 'dressed up' with the language of healthcare.\n\nResponse B Author: RobBobberstein\n\nResponse B: I would go a step farther and say that philosophy is only the process of transmitting notions and ideas, and has absolutely no authority in determining the truth of these notions and ideas.\n\nAn inquiry or idea must be refined down to a testable claim before it can ever be reasonably considered. I'm not saying that every claim must be taken to a lab, but I am saying that it must be at least able to speak to a common piece of data that we agree on.\n\nSometimes I can't help but feel that some believe that ruminating on lofty, grand, and ultimately pointless questions such as \"Can knowledge be defined as justified true belief?\" is an end-game in and of itself. I believe a much better question to ask would be \"what do you define as knowledge\" because this question seems to be attempting to ascribe a definition to an already existent notion. It seems to be asking \"can what most people understand the word 'knowledge' to be be formally defined as justified true belief?\" and \"is the way the word 'knowledge' typically used, as formally defined prior, sufficient to tackle the problems and expressions it's typically used to? And if not, what is? What are the problems this word seeks to help express solutions to and how could it be better amended towards that goal?\"\n\nI think these questions would be better equipped to provoke discussion because they more readily present themselves to understanding subjectivity as well as making answers to them more qualifiable.

In Canada (and the Common Law world generally) these defences have been restricted over time. Also, provocation defences are *not* absolute, they would only serve to reduce the charge to manslaughter (which I think you suggested in another comment).\n\nThe standard for these defences is highly restrictive: the shock needs to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary, unexcitable (and 'not pugnacious') person of self-control. It is not enough that you be shocked, insulted, betrayed, offended or repulsed. It must be serious enough to deprive you of responsibility for your own actions. \n\nUnfortunately, many people are prejudiced against trans-persons. This prejudice often manifests itself in the form of an unjustifed fear of sexual dishonesty (i.e. that the trans person will trick you into being attracted to them). This defence directly and unavoidably engages that prejudice such that it is unlikely that a judge or jury will assess it reasonably and with the appropriately high bar in mind. And, even if some judges/juries would (and no doubt some would) it remains the case that it is incredibly difficult/impossible to tell in advance who would and it is further very difficult to change this sort of behaviour/prejudice.\n\nLastly, the law in general, and the law of provocation defences in particular, play a normative role(The Alberta case [R v Tran](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7902/index.do) explains why this question *must* have a normative dimension where-ever it is asked). They endorse or condemn certain behaviours in recognition of the fact that these endorsements effect people's behaviour. Finding out someone is trans *should* never justify a crime and therefore the courts/legislature declare that it *will* never be permitted.\n\nResponse B Author: therapy\n\nResponse B: First, I agree with most of what you said, and your responses to other commenters. Yes, for most people, finding out they had sex with someone of a different gender than they expected can be shocking or even mentally unbalancing. Which is fair grounds for some amount of consideration of a \"heat of the moment\" defense, to reduce (but not eliminate) punishment.\n\nHowever, I still want to change your mind. Having a thing called \"trans panic defense\" or \"gay panic defense\" is dangerous for 2 main reasons:\n\n1. It special-cases the situations of rape by fraud when the fraudster happens to be transgender or gay. There is no need to special-case - a general \"heat of the moment\" defense based on **what is shocking to the actual person** is what matters. For example, an honestly highly-religious christian, who dates and marries someone that has misled them to believe they share their faith and depth of feeling for it, finds out their spouse is a complete atheist, posting hateful stuff on message boards against christians etc. The religious person loses it and strikes them. I think this deserves **some** amount of \"heat of the moment\" consideration, even though for most people it would be completely unshocking or even hard to understand (\"SO's an atheist, so? divorce him/her and move on\").\n2. Second, gay and trans people suffer higher than average rates of victimhood, including murder - sometimes the statistics are exaggerated, but even serious estimates show that they do get assaulted and murdered more often. For that reason, having a specific \"trans panic defense\" on the books is bad public policy - we need to **educate** people more on trans people, to reduce the amount of violence trans people suffer. A very powerful step towards that is to not have laws on the books that either legitimize violence against trans people, or seem to.\n\n\"Trans panic\" defenses therefore should be abolished. However, in specific circumstances, the gender - or religion, or age, or political views, or habits, or anything else - **might** be taken into account by the judge during sentencing.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author PM_Urquhart's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Since the invention of the internet, many of the questions that we test become obsolete. For high school exams, memorizing specific dates, names, functions etc. are fairly pointless when you could look it up in 5 seconds. Even in university, when writing essays becomes common, producing an analysis of passages in such a short time and stressful environment is not an indication many times of how much one knows, but often how much they have memorized what is mentioned in class. In particular, computer science exams, consisting of writing programs with no aid, is extremely ineffective and does not examine how much one actually knows of a subject.\n\nI believe a much better assessment would be through the use of final assignments, where students have a larger time in a less stressful environment. This allows access to all resources they would have in a job, and allows for teachers to provide them with much more difficult and interesting problems than could be provided on a short exam. While it is true that there would be the tendency to copy other students, such students likely will not make it into the job world simply relying on others. If anything, with less stress placed upon a single exam, there would not be the same pressure gradewise.\n\nChange my view. \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH\n\nResponse A: First off I have to admit that I have a huge bias. I am far better at tests than I am at projects.\n\nBut the reason for this is that I have the exact opposite reaction to these types of things. I am never stressed in a test, but often get extremely anxious and extremely stressed over projects. In these projects I often don't preform to my top measure because of this stress, but during a test I do preform my best.\n\nNow I'd also argue that most jobs are more test based. Other than engineering you usually have to do a lot of work on the spot. Being able to think quickly and memorizing material is important for when you are interacting with clients or customers.\n\nPersonally I think both are important but most people seem to be good at one or the other. Because of this I think that it would be best to give students to option to either do a project or a test.\n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: Exams (and the education system in general) are not really to test your \"knowledge\" as much as it is to stress you out and see how you perform. The education system is like a filter, it separates the capable from to no so capable. And it build you a transcript, showing of capable you are. \n\nObviously you still learn a lot of things, but that is the purpose for exams. They need a way to see student were able to learn all of the  information they were given. Not because the information is valuable, but because they want to see how well you can learn new material.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: I've been a Visual Studio .NET developer for 6 years after been a C++ developer for a similar time. MS Visual Studio is by far the best development environment I've used. Recently I brought into the open source \"I-only-use-a-text-editor\" development hype: I tried javascript, node, ruby on rails, clojure. edit: to clarify, I'm not talking about Java here - I've never used it, and I think it is vilified as much as VS.\n\nIt's like going back 20 years. ..Well, at least 15 - at least we had debug, edit, and continue back then. Chrome dev tools are only catching up 15 years later! Most people are still using dev tools and a separate editor, 1990 style!\n\nI think all these new languages are hype and most of you don't even know what intelli-sense is. \n\nJust Kidding - I do like these open source languages - but why are they better?\n\nCMV.\n\nResponse A Author: Hostilian\n\nResponse A: You're conflating programming language, development environment, and developer API.\n\n* Visual Studio is a development environment.\n* Nodejs and Ruby on Rails are both developer APIs. (There's more to it than that, but that's the most important part)\n* C++, Javascript (technically ECMAScript, Javascript is Mozilla's superset implementation of JS), Ruby, are all languages.\n\nYour development environment is entirely based on preference. Some people like powerful IDEs and the tools they provide. Others don't need that level of complexity, or need different tools that an environment doesn't provide. I'm on a development team of 15 people all working on a complex webapp powered by a java server; the frontend devs use lightweight editors like SublimeText, the backend devs use integrated IDEs like IntelliJ Idea, we have a few hacker-types who use vim. Each uses the tool that makes them the most productive.\n\nDeveloper API is what tools you are given as a developer to get things done with. Ruby on Rails is popular because it is an API that lets you do many things without writing a lot of boilerplate code. Nodejs is new and exciting because it exposes a simple, single-threaded I/O API; you can squeeze a lot of instructions out of a single process in node without worrying about preemptive multitasking.\n\nLanguage is a much more complex choice. Some languages are better at expressing certain concepts than others, or managing certain kinds of complex problems. Functional programming languages like Haskell or Clojure are easy to spread across a network, because units of functionality don't require a shared state to work. If you want to write client-side code for the browser, your only choice is javascript.\n\nAs a concrete example comparing C++ to Javascript: Get some JSON data from a remote network resource, parse it into a data object, and find the largest number stored somewhere in the collection of data it returns. Doing this in a non-blocking, memory-safe way in C++ is tricky, and requires some thinking about how the system works. In javascript, this can be wrapped up in a simple call to `http.get` and a call to `reduce`, and the way this is actually executed by the virtual machine is unimportant.\n\nResponse B Author: dokushin\n\nResponse B: The open-source development environment is called ***Linux***.\n\nYou have:\n\n - gcc: One of the best optimizing compilers in the world for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, Ada, and Go,\n - Others:  Industry-standard interpreters for Perl, Python, Haskell, OCaml, Erlang, and craptons of other stuff\n - vim, emacs:  Extremely powerful, syntax-highlighted, macro-driven, customizable text editors with tens of thousands of modules, plugins, and guides and support for code tags, call trees, regular expressions, etc. etc.\n - gdb:  A powerful debugger with deep support for analysis\n - grpof:  A comprehensive general profiler with dozens of utilities to analyze the results\n - valgrind:  A leading memory analysis framework with tools for categorizing memory issues, race conditions, stack corruption, and lots more\n - make:  scriptable build system with completely open support for user commands, variables, conditionals, pattern substution, and so forth\n - autotools:  utilities for automatically generating inputs for make AND for tailoring it to the system in question\n - grep:  search through directories of text files and get results with line number and context\n - svn, git, mercurial, etc.:  support for any reasonable version control\n\nThat's just from the *command line*, and most of that stuff doesn't require installing anything.  And this is *before you pay for anything*.\n\nI've been using vim for a few years (not that long by guru standards) and I'm easily 3-4x more productive in it than in a more traditional IDE-style editor.  With ctags and similar tools I can use it to jump to a definition of any variable, function, or class, view a call tree or an object browser, or fold in sections of code that are in my way.\n\nIf you've only used the relatively dumb editors in (even the latest versions of) Visual Studio, you have *absolutely no idea* how much more powerful a strong editor is.  Yes, there's a learning curve, but for something that you're going to be doing every day for the rest of your life, it's not prohibitive.\n\nFor other tasks, the standard (GNU) Linux command line has evolved over the course of twenty years to be one of the best text-processing tools in the world, due largely to the piping paradigm, the wide variety of text processing tools standard in the shell, and the ease and integration of things like Perl scripts.\n\nI manage a large C systems code base and it would be much, much harder without the tools Linux affords (and I have a lot of development experience in both MS and Linux environments).

Similarly, when there is someone more attractive than me, I am largely ignored. I don't think this is a matter of youth, as I'm now in my mid-20s and this has persisted with people of all ages. \n\nWomen who are attractive get tons of preferential treatment, there's no doubt about that, but I believe it extends to men too and is the single most important factor in determining how people treat you at first. Not kindness, not wealth, but largely your physical appearance. My breakdown would be 70% face/body/how you carry yourself, 30% how you are dressed. \n\nThis leads to *vastly* different life experiences in that ugly children and attractive children are treated significantly differently than one another, leading to differences in how they view the world, strangers, and social interaction. \n\nThe puzzling question is why? In the case of attractive men and women who are of age, you could argue that wanting to mate with them or improve social status, but even when this is unlikely or impossible (one party is married - don't snicker) the preferential treatment continues. Is it because they are pleasing to look at? Why does that matter so much? \n\nHere I would place an attempt to rebut a counterargument but I can't even begin to think of one, which is why I made this post. Physical appearance is largely out of our control beyond good hygiene and how you dress. It's a pretty depressing thought to think that someone's whole life experience is determined by a roll of the dice, and I'd like someone to change my view on this. \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: cold08\n\nResponse A: Since we're ranking traits here, we should first look at our self serving bias'. That means we tend to put more weight on others bias' when we are treated unfairly in a negative way and discount them when the unfairness is to our benefit. It makes sense that you put attractiveness above other things that don't negatively effect you personally.\n\nYour breakdown for example, doesn't include skin color, which if you even just search this subreddit is an attractiveness dealbreaker for many. If skin pigment itself disqualifies you from being attractive, then things like face/body/bone structure/how you carry yourself/how you dress all doesn't matter.\n\nIn the end, ranking all of this business doesn't matter. You can't force others to treat you more fairly because you are the treated the unfairliest. The point of looking at our privileges and our bias' is to look at ourselves and how these things affect our worldview and our decision making so that we can have a more accurate view of the world and make better decisions.\n\nResponse B Author: clairebones\n\nResponse B: I would suggest that more important than the natural attractiveness you mention is how well-put-together a person is. You can be the most attractive person in the city, but if you look like a slob and don't take care of yourself, you're unlikely to be treated well by strangers. By the same token, someone who is not conventionally attractive put puts effort and time in to presenting themselves well would often get a better reaction and better treatment than someone attractive but with messy clothes, bad hair, bad breath, etc.\n\nIt makes sense that we would care about how someone presents themselves, as it suggests characteristics like responsibility, self awareness, maturity, understanding of social norms, etc that are important when we interact with people.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author cold08's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

This would be no different than those with a high school education going and murdering those with a university education.   Averagely we could ensure that those with higher education will dominate in leader positions and economic positions over those of lesser education.   However the differences they make within society also goes to help those of the lower education.\n\nThe same can be applied to this alien species.   Instead of seeing them as a threat they can be a valuable friend and ally  and if we are currently more developed than them we could help them on their way which will create that relationship.   The advances they make can also be used to greatly benefit us if we share our discoveries  perhaps even making us on par with them and equals.\n\nBesides in this hypothetical we then also cannot rule out the existence of hostile aliens that may be more advanced than us.  Your suggestion of killing possible friends  may be destroying our only hope of being able to defend ourselves.     There are plenty of species on this planet that depend on each other mutually for each to survive  and I am sure this could someday be the case on a interplanetary scale.\n\nFurthermore what if we met advanced species that would have otherwise been friendly or nuetral to us that learned of our habits of genocide entire other intelligent species?  Do you think that reputation would do us any good and not justify  a preemptive strike against us?\n\nResponse B Author: ilikedirigibles\n\nResponse B: If we have technology sufficient for exploring other inhabited planets, then we've no doubt also achieved a level of technology that we would use to improve ourselves.\n\nFor example, genetic engineering and cybernetic enhancements -- we will eventually reach a point where we will be able to tweak our genetics and integrate technology to deliberately benefit our population on every conceivable level, from health to physical strength to memory capacity and intelligence.\n\nIf we do this, is there really a threat to our sovereignty from another species, even if their baseline started with a higher potential than the human baseline? I would say no.\n\nEven if the best that we could be is only half as good as the best that they can be, we'd already be so far above the just-barely-self-aware primates that we are right now that we'd have no argument that would be solved through the use of force.\n\nAny two sufficiently intelligent, and sufficiently rational beings cannot really disagree about a correct course of action, and anyone that isn't sufficiently rational and intelligent wouldn't pose any kind of threat.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author NuclearShadow's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: If someone you know dies, and God is not real, they will just not exist anymore. If they die, not believing in Jesus, they go to Hell. Which is more comforting to you? Believing someone is being tortured forever, or believing they just will just not exist anymore? True Christianity has to teach about Hell for non believers. You cannot comfort family and friends by telling them their whoever is in a better place, if to your knowledge they never believed and/or openly denied Jesus. Please change my view.\n\nResponse A Author: Galphanore\n\nResponse A: On balance people are inherently selfish. We are generally more concerned with ourselves than with other people. This is panned out time and time again throughout history. So, if given the choice between something that provides comfort directly to yourself or something that provides comfort for you only by how it affects others most people will chose the former, all else being equal.\n\nSo, to compare the two. If you are Christian then you generally believe that *you* will go to heaven. Furthermore, you believe that *anyone who asks Jesus for forgiveness* can *also* go to heaven. To someone who believes, that is not something that should be hard to do. So the existence of hell is not as much of a negative in the mind of a believer as you are making it out to be because to them you can only end up in hell if you reject Jesus. So in a way you deserve it. More than even that, though, is that a belief in hell gives you the comfort of *knowing* that even if someone who does great evil in this life gets away without corporeal punishment, God will not let them get away without *any* punishment. \n\nAtheism, on the other hand, takes away all of that. To an atheist who does not believe in an afterlife everyone is equal in death. What you do in life has no greater meaning and when your life is over, it is truly ended. You, as the being you are with all of the life experiences you have had and all the joy you have experienced, are *gone*. Fearing dying is nothing in comparison to the realization that once you die you cease to exist. Completely. Oblivian. On top of that, if someone avoids corporeal punishment for their wrongs then they get away scott free.\n\nFor instance, Hitler died without facing any kind of judgement for his actions. For an atheist the only comfort is in knowing that he died. He is gone. So, however, are all of the people he killed. All of his victims who died in horrible pain after having their lives ruined, being starved, and in many cases tortured suffered a slow painful death but Hitler is said to have died by committing suicide. He died from a single gunshot wound to the head. In a way he got away with everything he did. For a Christian, however, he is in hell. They get the comfort of knowing that God is punishing the wrongs that Hitler did. \n\nSo I think that you are not considering all of the other kinds of comfort that are possible when you focus on comparing hell to nonexistence. When taken as a whole, Christianity, whether true or not, provides more comfort than atheism. That's part of its appeal and part of what makes giving it up so painful for so many people, even when they start questioning whether it is true or not.\n\nResponse B Author: jennerality\n\nResponse B: Er, why is it less comforting just because there's an existence of hell? I would imagine the existence of heaven is really what makes Christianity comforting. If you're atheist, *everyone* just dies and ceases to exist. There is no hope for anyone. For most people, in that case, life is pretty pointless. If you're Christian, some people go to heaven, some people go to hell, but you yourself get to go to heaven. That in itself is very comforting; most people consider themselves the most important to them, after all. Even if some of your loved ones aren't Christian, that doesn't mean they will go to hell, they can just convert. That's why many Christians keep trying to get their friends or family to convert.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Galphanore's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I was sent to a Catholic school since Kindergarten and will be graduating from my Catholic high school in a few months. As much as I love the small community, I wish I could have had a say in where I got to go. I've been forced into religion by my parents from a small age. There was no other option.

The fact that you don't like it doesn't make what they are doing *wrong*, it just means they have to decide if coercing you into church is, in the long run, better for you than peacefully letting you stay home. \n\nShaming you for your beliefs, threatening to kick you out of the house - that's emotional abuse born out of a hurt inside your parents. They probably have a deep desire, a good desire, to see you thrive at their church, as they thrive there. Its painful to see you reject their beliefs and the establishment they've aligned with. They're responding to you wrong, but that doesn't invalidate the right and responsibility that each parent has to give the best, whatever that looks like, to their child.\n\nInstead of trying to attack their right to behave the way they do, you probably have a better time getting what you want if you worked hard to have calm, reasoned discussions with your parents with an emphasis on saying two absolutely critical things - 1) \"I know that church is important to you and that you want to share it with me. I appreciate your love for me that makes you want to share this part of your life with me\"   and 2) \"I respect your beliefs and I don't want to cause you any hurt, but I don't share them and am frustrated by my continued visits to church.\"   \n\nThe key to effective interpersonal communication with anyone in life is to restate and affirm their position, and then respectfully present your own position in terms of how you are experiencing the situation (not in terms of what that person is doing to you or trying to undercut their position). If you try to have repeated, calm, respectful talks, you have a better chance at getting out of church. I don't promise anything, but its worth a shot.\n\n\nResponse B Author: Master-Thief\n\nResponse B: Children do not always make good choices.  That's part of the nature of being a child.  You have no real life experience to draw on, and you're prone to fallacious thinking--prioritizing present wants over future opportunities, seeing everything in black vs. white terms, prone to follow fads and trends, prone to favor things that seem new and exciting over things that seem old and stale, tending to go along with the herd even while thinking all the while that you're rejecting conformity.\n\nThere's no insult in that.  It's just the way of humanity.  It is in the nature of children to push back against what their parents taught them.  It's normal (and if you talk to psychologists, healthy in moderation.)  Yet, when you get to be older--particularly if you have kids of your own--you will look back and come to one of two realizations about everything your parents told you and did for you:\n\na) Holy shit, they were actually *right*, and we were too cocksure and immature to realize it.\n\nb) Well hell, even if they were wrong, they were trying to do the best thing possible for us in the best way they knew how because dammit, they *loved* us, and they deserve our respect for trying instead of our scorn.\n\nNow, you've reached the age when you are no longer under your parents' control.  You can make your own choices.  Some of the choices you make will be right.  Some will be wrong.  Your parents' beliefs and morals may not have been perfect.  Yours will not be either.  Nobody's is.\n\nWhat your parents were doing wasn't \"indoctrinating\" you.  (That is a grossly unfair and uncharitable word to use.) Children do not come into the world knowing anything.  A parent that teaches their child nothing that the child does not choose is, in the final analysis, a poor parent. Martin Luther King Jr. once wrote that the opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference.  And considering how expensive a Catholic education can be, if you cannot be grateful for what you learned, you can at least appreciate that they cared about you enough to make a substantial financial sacrifice to ensure that your education included elements of morality and ethics that public schools, for the most part, don't bother with.\n\n(And no, your mother isn't going to kick you out of the house.  Parents and children tend to say things like that to each other.

I don\u2019t want to get into semantics so I\u2019m not claiming to be a follower of classical liberalism or neo-liberalism or anything else but a modern and hyper liberal American.  Since I love this subreddit I\u2019ll provide you with some easy arguments for you to knock down.  =)  I will change my view if you can show how \u2018forward thinking, inclusivism, secularism, or personal liberty\u2019 are bad values to have or show in some way that being a modern liberal is bad for myself or society. \n\nWHAT IS LIBERALISM? \n\n1) \tForward Thinking \u2013  I believe social liberalism correctly pushes the boundaries of what society currently thinks is acceptable towards more egalitarian bounds.  Conservative thinking is dominated by ideas like \u201ctradition\u201d and \u201cmaintaining order or status quo\u201d which it advances at the cost of excluding certain groups.  I specifically believe that tradition is harmful as it inappropriately resists change without providing merit.  I believe the abolition of slavery, suffrage of women, lax immigration policies, and the guaranteeing of rights by the government are liberal ideas that are beneficial to society.\n\n2) \tInclusivism \u2013 I believe liberalism is an ideology that tries to include as many people as possible.  I feel liberalism correctly values the group over the individual.  (ex: What good are \u2018my\u2019 rights if I only get them by infringing on others?)  I believe that everyone is better off when everyone is given equal protection and rights.  When employees have enough disposable income to purchase consumer goods they increase economic output much more than if all the income and wealth was concentrated in the hands of few individuals. (see banana republics vs current America and debt fueled consumption as one of the primary cause of the 1930s and 2008 depressions).  \n\n3) \tSECULARISM \u2013 I believe that governments and all non-religious groups should operate in a completely secular manner because it provides better real world results and doesn\u2019t disenfranchise anyone.  I believe that corporations should not be able to espouse or enforce particular religious beliefs (ex: a church can be doctrinally against birth control but it, nor any business, should not be allowed to deny said birth control to its employees).  In matters of science vs faith I will always side with science as I believe \u2018most\u2019 liberals would.  I place zero merits in matters of faith when presented as such and believe morality is not provided by, grounded in, nor should it be regulated by, a religion.  (Any claim not based in fact is either a working hypothesis or a statement of faith.  I may have to accept partial blame for \u2018radical hippies\u2019 that do not support data driven science such as gmo haters and nuclear power scardy-cats.  It seems that these people are in the minority among liberals BUT If you feel the \u2018average liberal\u2019 supports these types of faith based anti-data claims then please hammer away at me).  \n\n\n4) \tPERSONAL LIBERTY \u2013 The government is the primary protector of the citizen\u2019s rights and liberties.  Personal responsibility outlined by libertarians and conservatives only goes so far since vigilante enforcement is not as conducive to society as official police actions and lynch mobs should be replaced by a judiciary.  Liberals believe that morality and personal behavior should not be regulated by an outside entity.  Free love, marrying whomever you chose, freedom of and from religion, 1st and 4th amendment rights, and the right to privacy, are all liberal ideas that I support.  I do not believe you have the right to infringe on the rights of others.  I believe that women are the equals of men and that all races are equal to each other.  \u201cSeparate but equal\u201d is not equal and true equality not only means equal rights but equal opportunity to fulfill those rights.\n\nLightning round...\n\n5) 2nd Amendment = pro gun ownership, pro heavy regulation\n\n6) Big Government = globalization and big businesses need big  government support.  Remember only conservatives say \"I demand big government get their hands off my medicare\".\n\n7) Taxes = The required big government needs big income.  Our current government is too big and can be for sure be streamlined, but it cannot be halved or quartered.  \n\n8) Climate Change = I side with science.  No, there is no debate.\n\n9) Abortion = I can prove with science that the mother is alive.  Until you can prove with science that a specific subset of her cells commonly known as a fetus is a separate and living organism capable of equal amounts of autonomy as the mother then I feel you have no ground to stand on.  \n\n10) The Draft = Against it.  Unless America is facing a crisis of civilization ending proportions then there's no need to dilute a strong fighting force with people that don't want to be there.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: I-HATE-REDDITORS\n\nResponse A: \nJust a minor point: the vast majority of libertarians and conservatives support a strong judiciary to protect people's rights.\n\nOtherwise though:  do you think all liberals feel the same way you do about these issues?  Certainly not all liberals support gun ownership.  Certainly not all liberals feel the same way about abortion.\n\nSo why raise a flag that says \"I AM A LIBERAL\"?  Does this particular set of personal beliefs demonstrate the essence of the \"modern political sense of the word\"?  Or are you lumping yourself in with a much larger group of individuals-- many of whom you may disagree with on many things-- for the illusion of unity and \"us and them\" defiance?\n\nWhether you're on the right or the left, fervent ideology is unproductive and often dangerous.  I'm not sure anyone can change your view about these individual positions, but I'd like to change your view about how you self-identify.  What's the point of reducing your political views to \"LIBERAL\" or \"CONSERVATIVE\" when you're an individual?   Is the label meaningful at all?   After all, a \"liberal\" congressman in 1993 behaves nothing like a \"liberal\" congressman in 2014.\n\nI would say you're a person with liberal position on most issues.  To me, there's a big difference between saying that and saying \"I am a liberal.\"\n\nResponse B Author: SasakitheMinor\n\nResponse B: I feel like there's conflict between a few of your views.\n\n1. Inclusivism vs The Draft\nIn the event that soldiers actually were needed, Inclusivism would say that we would need to draft people for the greater good.\n\n2. Inclusivism and taxes vs Personal Liberty\nInclusivism supports a lot of wealth redistribution, whereas PL would let people do what they want with their own finances.\n\n3. Inclusivism and Climate Change vs Personal Liberty.\nInclusivism would say that we should regulate individual energy consumption.\nPL would let people use what they want.\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author I-HATE-REDDITORS's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Even when I moved abroad for study, I voted. I was a firm believer that, being fortunate enough to live in a \"democracy\" where one can vote, we have a duty to do so.\n\nFuck that.\n\nI'm tired of politicians and the bullshit that spews forth from their lying, deceitful gums. I'm tired of the Tories, I'm tired of the Lib Dems, I'm tired of Labour, I'm tired of the Greens, I'm tired of UKIP. It's all bullshit and they're all bullshitters. The Green Party and UKIP are mostly straight-shooters, but their policies leave a lot to be desired. Politics is for the parties, not the people.\n\nI was at a local council meeting yesterday - a Lib Dem stronghold - where they proposed an increase in councillor allowances. Over the last year rent, parking, and taxes have all increased throughout the borough. The Conservative opposition opposed the blanket increase saying that most of the councillors could comfortably afford to live without a rise in allowance. They thought it better to put the taxpayer's money that would fund the increased allowance back into the community. The conservatives were outvoted by something on the order of 50-6. There are 50 Lib Dem councillors and 6 Conservative councillors. That isn't democracy. Unless you were present at the meeting, the borough's residents wouldn't have even known about this increase. This is a microcosm of national politics.\n\nAnd this is just one example of many. There are member's of parties being suspended for going against party lines, even though they're sticking up for their constituents! That is what politicians should be doing!\n\nAnyway, I won't continue muchlonger. I live in a Labour stronghold and I have two options: vote for Labour, because they'll win anyway, or waste a vote on another party. Do the majority of votes actually have any implication in this election anyway? The \"first past the post\" is flawed. Look at the popular vote/seats percentages for the last election:\n\nParty|Votes|Seats\n--|--|--\nConservatives|10.8 M (36.4%)|306 (47.1%)\nLabour|8.6M (29%)|258 (39.7%)\nLiberal Democrats|6.8M (23%)|57 (8.8%)\n\nHow, when 23% of the voters chose one party, did they get just fewer than 9% of the seats? How is that a reflection of the people. \n\nParty|One Seat|Votes Needed\n--|--|--\nLabour|1|33,370\nConservatives|1|35,313\nLiberal Democrats|1|119,944\n\nIt's beyond a joke.\n\nI'm tired of politics and politicians and, as such, I won't be voting in this General Election. I want to, so desperately, but don't see any point in doing so...\n\nMy vote means fuck all. Yeah, no rain drop thinks it's responsible for the flood and all that jazz. But you need hundreds of sandbags to stop it, and I'm just a grain.\n\nPlease, help me change my view (and sorry for the rant).\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Quartetra\n\nResponse A: I eagerly await a different form of governance - perhaps something resembling technocracy/The Venus Project - though i'm not optimistic about seeing it happen in my lifetime.\n\nIn the meantime, OP, join me in voting for [None of the Above](http://www.votenone.org.uk/). It's not a party. \n\nSpoiling your ballot will enable the Electoral Commission to dismiss your vote as 'voter's intention uncertain', is not considered a protest, and will be lumped in with inevitable stats showing 'apathy'. \n\nhttp://www.votenone.org.uk/protest_votes_count.html\n\n\nIt is hardly democracy when we are not given a legitimate option to express dissatisfaction with the system. The website gives clear advice on how to use your vote:\n \n     To establish a right to say 'no' in UK elections, protest votes must be clear beyond dispute, and multiply in number. \n\n     Ensure your protest vote is clear\n\n     - Don't put a cross (or tick) anywhere.\n     - Don't write anything else which could identify you, or create any uncertainty or excuse.\n     - Just put a single line through all the boxes.\n\n     Write NONE across the ballot paper, so that your intention is clear beyond dispute.\n     It will then be indefensible to classify it as 'voter's intention uncertain'.\n\n\nUltimately the needs and problems of our planet cannot be dealt with in good time by our political system, particularly one in which the parties are homogeneous and subject to the same [bribery](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/general-election-2015-concerns-raised-as-just-76-individuals-account-for-41-of-all-political-related-donations-in-the-past-five-years-10187474.html) by the same handful of people.

So please, change my view \n\nResponse A Author: vl99\n\nResponse A: It's not a perfect analogy, but I work in TV, and you tend to hear a lot of similar alarmist statements that are frankly, baseless.\n\nWhile it's true ratings have decreased overall with over-saturation of television channels and increase of choices in programs to watch, this only means salespeople and advertisers have to get more creative. \n\nIn the old days all you had to do was plunk down a Nielsen sheet in front of an advertiser showing 20 points for an episode of the X Files and suddenly you've got a show that everyone wants a piece of. Today it's become normal for people to pay alright prices for 1 point and top dollar for 5+ (usually stuff like football home games or premieres). And everyone is doing the same numbers. An episode of breaking bad, one of the most critically lauded shows of all time might get a 1.8 whereas in a local market here an episode of Arrow might do the same just cause that's what's on. \n\nSince so many shows get the same numbers but some get more hype than others, a salesperson has to convince advertisers why their show might fit the client better. This is why you see ads for haunted houses and upcoming horror movies when you turn on an episode of American Horror Story and ads for musicals and headphones when you're watching Glee.\n\nSure you have your filler ads by the big companies that drop money just to be included in whatever program but salespeople at least at a local level have gotten a lot more creative recently with how they pitch shows to prospective advertisers. Ads are a lot more targeted to the demographics that view the shows the ads play on. For example IHOP only airs in early morning shows and has a 10am cutoff cause they want you to go out and get pancakes right away. Characters in ads now have cult followings like Mayhem, Flo, the old spice guy, and the most interesting man in the world. So even though you still have to sit through a bunch of ads during commercial breaks, the chances of one of those ads appealing to you are much higher because that sort of evolution was actually needed for advertisement to continue on TV. This brings me back to the original point.\n\nRather than a valid mode of advertising collapsing after the advent of new shows taking up more and more market share or the invention of devices that let you fast forward through commercials, TV advertising has grown and evolved.\n\nThe same will happen with online advertising when adblock becomes enough of a disruption. It will be up to advertisers to find a way to make people want to turn it off. And I have no doubt all agencies will gladly rise to the challenge.\n\nWhether it's forcing agencies to come up with new characters, viral campaigns, or ads  that are better targeted and actually useful to the people that view the websites, I can guarantee adblock will do more to spur innovation in advertising than it will to harm it.\n\nResponse B Author: SaddestCatEver\n\nResponse B: Yes, some sites will make less money. These will be sites like BuzzFeed etc where the goal is click bait and user farming (quantity over quality).\n\nHowever, we'll see a rise in alternate forms of advertising. For example, it will be more and more common to see product placement (example: that car from Walking Dead), content advertising (example: old spice ads, or company blogs), and voluntary fundraising (example: reddit gold).\n\nMore sites might adopt a freemium model. For example: Pandora and Trello, where the features are free, yet they offer a paid option that makes a better experience for their top users.\n\nTL;DR: There are many options for websites to generate revenue then to \"pay-wall\" content and force paid models.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author vl99's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I have never drank alcohol.  A lot of people think this is strange, and have tried to convince me to start.  But none of them have ever given me a good reason.  None of their descriptions of drunkeness sound remotely pleasant, and the potential consequences of blacking out sound terrifying.\n\nI do acknowledge that there may be some evidence that small amounts of alcohol can have health benefits.  I might at some point decide to drink a carefully measured quantity for medicinal purposes, but this post is about drinking recreationally.\n\nThe only disadvantage to not drinking I see is that I am out of place at many social events that revolve around alcohol.  Although I am an extremely introverted person, and do not feel a strong desire to attend these events, I suppose I might be missing out on some potential friendships or networking opportunities.  However, I feel that as I get older, the prevalence of drinking culture in my peer group will likely decrease.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: andero\n\nResponse A: \nIt is statistically strange, but certainly not a problem.\n\n\nDo you have a \"good reason\" to abstain from alcohol altogether? Do you have a \"good reason\" to never try a single drink?\n\nAlcohol, as any drug, can be abused. If you do not abuse it, it can be nice. It is available, kinda fun, but not the best.\n\nHave you tried other drugs? Cannabis? Magic mushrooms? MDMA? LSD? Anything non-medical? If yes, what did you think? If no, why not?\n\nHere are some basic reasons to drink responsibly:\n\n* Wine and beer go better with food than most other beverages. You can enjoy food in a whole different way when you open up your palate.\n\n* Alcohol helps you relax. Even just a first sip of a beer is psychologically relaxing. (Part of the medical benefit is from relaxation, iirc)\n\n* Alcohol is a social drug and it sucks to be the sober guy around drinking people. It also sucks to be the drunk guy around sober people, or the very drunk guy around buzzed people.\n\n* The negative effects of alcohol are relatively easy to avoid (unless, perhaps, you have a family history of alcoholism or a tendency toward substance abuse)\n\nYou do not need to drink, and if you do you do not need to get drunk, and if you do, you certainly do not need to drink to the point of blacking out. If you are in your late 20s, that type of behaviour is probably already looked down upon (depending on your crowd).\n\nAll I can say is that I was against drinking because my father was an alcoholic. I think I first tried it around 21 and realized how harshly I had pre-judged it. Alcohol is not bad, it is a tool, a drug like all the rest. If the user uses the tool badly we should not blame the tool. Over time I became a more sophisticated drinker and now I prefer the right beer or wine with certain meals. What are your other options? Pop/Soda? Gross. Juice? Am I 5 years old? Water? Excellent beverage, but boring as a food-pairing. \n\nResponse B Author: jefftickels\n\nResponse B: Drinking any kind of alcoholic beverage is quite enjoyable for reasons that are *not* getting drunk.  I would say that anyone who argues you should drink so that you can get drunk is foolish.  \n\nAlcohol comes in many forms, and can be quite enjoyable (but is generally an acquired taste).  I've had beers that tasted like chocolate, a beer that tasted like a crisp fermented tangerine (my God it was truely amazing, it was a citra saison), a traditional liter of oktoberfest (ok here we might be drinking to get drunk), a sour brettanomyces beer, and many others.  And this is just beer.  Wines and Scotch have an enormous depth to the experience as well.\n\nLike many hobbies it can be a way to connect with people and strangers.  As an introvert you may find connecting with others difficult, and discussing alcohol is a fantastic way to bridge this gap.  Similar to people who like coffee, or board games, or food, alcohol can be a hobby that can connect you to others (beyond drunkeness).\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author andero's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: I'm (similar to much of Reddit) a relatively liberal person, and I was raised Jewish and identify as an atheist. But Pope Francis, even to me, seems like he's doing a great job with the shitstorm the last Pope left him, which seems like a popular opinion. While the last Pope defended homophobia, sexism, prejudice, and practically even defended child abuse, Francis seems to be handling the Catholic Church extremely well. Is this the sentiment shared by everyone, or is this just what he's being made out to be? CMV\n\nResponse A Author: david71119\n\nResponse A: I don't think he has \"radically transformed\" the Church just yet, sure he has publicly spoken about all those issues, but he hasn't taken any action against it, and until he does you can't really say that he has transformed the church. The church still spends WAY too much money on building churches and such things vs helping the poor, priests/bips/... receive too much money IMO (I would be of different opinion if they could have a family, but they can't), gay people still can't marry, etc. \n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: Disclaimer: I graduated from a Catholic seminary college. I'm pretty well informed, but I'm not a scholar. \n\nWhat you have to understand is that Francis hasn't actually done anything. He has not made any significant changes to Catholic doctrine. It's a complicated issue, but the short answer is: He can't. He does not have the power to ordain women, or bless gay marriage. Catholicism doesn't work that way. It believes that it exists as the fullness of truth on earth. It can evolve, but it cannot be wrong (in specific instances about specific things which is also really complicated). \n\nAt best, Pope Francis can start the ball rolling towards an \"evolution\", but that process can take centuries. Seriously. Like 300 fucking years. If you study history, one thing you will see very clearly is that the Catholic Church is not in a hurry and they generally do what they want, regardless of popular opinion. That is based on Catholic theology. They are not like Protestants, they can't just change their minds about significant things. They do, mind you...it's been happening for centuries. At one time they taught that only Catholics could be saved. Now they believe salvation is open to all (with many caveats). That is clearly not evolution, it's change. But they have to be sneaky about it and twist the theology around to make it seem like evolution. It's a long process. \n\nWhen the subject of Pope Francis comes up and people start making claims like yours, my stock response is: I'll believe it when I see it in Latin. Or, when I'm being sassy: If you like it than you should have put an encyclical on it. (Seminary humor, sorry.) By that I mean that he hasn't made much official. He just selectively chooses already-existing elements of Catholic doctrine and says them together in a way that makes him sound more liberal. Pope Benedict holds all of those beliefs (he actually wrote many of them), he just didn't find them important to state out loud. So far it's all just spin. He's on a worldwide PR campaign for the Church. \n\nHere's what to look for. If you hear about him creating female cardinals (the guys in red who elect the pope), rejoice. You have to be a male to be a priest but you don't have to be a priest to be a cardinal. Elevating a female cardinal is fair game...it's never been done before but he could do it. That would put some meat on his statements. Also, like I said, watch for latin. If he releases something with a name like \"Lumen Gentium\" or \"Dignitatis Humanae\" then perk up and take notice. If he calls for \"Vatical III\" then jump up and down for joy cuz the motherfucker ain't playin'. That's a council, and he can make real substantial changes there. BUT, only if he has the support of the bishops, which he doesn't because they were all chosen by more conservative popes.\n\nTL;DR It's all just fluff and spin at this point.

Polar bears are a symbol. A barometer to measure a general problem of species loss and diminishing biodiversity. A cute face to put with a large and complex problem that is difficult to connect with without a specific example. Kind of like those feed the starving children campaigns that give you a name and a story to hang your hat on. \n\nSome figures estimate as high as 1/4 of all species on Earth will disappear in the next 50 years. Here's some selfish reasons why you should care about species loss in general. \n\n1. The loss of medical models to understand human physiology and disease. To exist today, each species has undergone millions of years of evolutionary shaping, which can be utilized to further scientific research. Shark cartilage can teach us about the secret to tumor inhibition. Studying bear hibernation may be the key to treating osteoporosis. If an animal disappears, the evolutionary secrets that that organism contained will be forever lost to medical science. \n\n2. The loss of new medicines that may successfully treat diseases that cause great human suffering. Animals themselves are an important part of the total pharmacopoeia. Scientists have analyzed the chemistry less than 1% of the rainforest plants, and even less of the animals. If we progress with mass extinction, we may be destroying the cure for cancer before it's even discovered. \n\n3. Disturbing ecosystem equilibrium. This point is pretty well covered elsewhere. Circle of life and all. Imbalance could effect our food supplies, make us susceptible to infections disease, and even effect the global environment. \n\nCaring about polar bears is more about caring about polar bears. It's caring about the circumstances that would cause the extinction of not only polar bears, but thousands of species. And I think you should care about that. \n\nPersonally, I care about polar bears because they're cool, and I like knowing things I like exist, even if I may never see them for myself. \n\nResponse B Author: kingbane\n\nResponse B: well, i wouldn't say it would have zero impact. the environment is rarely a bubble, especially when you're dealing with large predators. here's a small example, polar bears are one of the few predators that eat seals. seals consume INSANE amounts of fish annually. world fish stocks are already at all time lows due to overfishing. if polar bears are wiped out that's another predator of seals gone and that means even less fish for the world to fish out of the ocean. prices of sushi and seafood goes up. \n\n\nas for saving the polar bears, we wouldn't be artificially saving them. we'd be saving ourselves from the effects of global warming and a side effect of that is saving the polar bears. the polar bear is just a symptom of the problem, the problem is global warming. \n\nglobal warming's effects are far reaching, the most troubling of which is the acidification of the oceans. this is important cause close to half of the world's oxygen production from the algae in the oceans. a more acidic ocean leads to less and less algae. there is a critical point where algae can no longer survive and that would be incredibly bad for us humans. lower thresholds of acidity that could cause troubles lie with various creatures that depend on calcium carbonate, shelled animals, as well as coral. no more coral means a lot more damage to beaches due to waves. no more shelled animals, means crabs and lobsters are gone, and they're delicious. also a lot of the shelled sea creatures are part of the disposal system of the oceans. they keep the oceans clean of carcasses and what not. not to mention krill would die out. krill are basically eaten by every creature in the ocean on the lower rung to middle rungs of the food chain. if krill die out it would nearly wipe out the ocean's life.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author possumopossum's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

But then I thought, what if I owned a screen print shop and Westboro Baptist Church wanted me to print up a bunch of homophobic shirts I'd tell them to get the hell out.  Or if I was a tattoo artist and someone wanted a neo-nazi tattoo should I have to do that as well?

Furthermore, if we remove values and morals from the equation, what if I owned a restaurant and my crazy ex wanted to come in just to be rude could I tell her to leave and that she wasn't welcome?\n\nResponse A Author: tricerabear\n\nResponse A: Generally if you own a business you *can* refuse to do business with anyone. Lots of shops post signs \"we reserve the right to refuse service\", and they do. I'm pretty sure as a print shop you can refuse to serve WBC, or your ex-girlfriend.\n\nBUT, for certain classes of businesses, called common carriers, they don't have this right to refuse because we decided the economy as a whole depends on them serving everyone. Examples of this are hotels, transport companies, and restaurants, although you can always ask people to leave for making a disturbance or bothering people (if your ex comes in just to be rude, for example). If places to eat and sleep can refuse people at will it supposedly hurts interstate commerce, because it makes travel harder. Most businesses (print shops, tattoo artists, etc.) can turn down clients without having to explain themselves, but the ones that can't are very visible.\n\nThe other thing is there are certain protected classes when we look at discrimination, such as race, orientation, and gender, where the court will be more actively suspicious if you refuse to do business with lots of people who have the same (blank). I don't think political beliefs or your personal relationship with someone have special protection. If I run a consultancy, I'm free to turn down all democrat/republican/green party/neo-nazi/ex-girlfriend clients if I want to.\n\nTL;DR: Businesses have tremendous control over who they work with and who they refuse to serve, but this control is limited for certain kinds of businesses called common carriers, and for certain protected classes of customers who have historically been discriminated against.\n\nResponse B Author: Severaxe\n\nResponse B: The reason most people think that it is discrimination to refuse to serve homosexuals, but okay refuse service to those who wish to discriminate is the reason service was refused. For those who will not provide service to homosexuals, they are refusing service based solely on their sexual orientation. If you refuse to tattoo an anti-gay message on someone's arm, it is because of the nature of the message, not their race, gender or beliefs. By opening a business and agreeing to sell to the general public, you accept that you have to provide service to anyone who wants your services, and denying them these services is discrimination. However, if you open a tattoo parlour or a T-shirt shop, you have not accepted that you will print homophobic or racist messages. This is not discrimination because you would not print these messages for anyone.

Change my view please.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: sm0cc\n\nResponse A: Are you familiar with the [Aristotle's modes of persuasion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion)? The idea is that in rhetoric there are three primary channels of persuasion: ethos (authority), pathos (emotion), and logos (logic). A really good and persuasive argument usually involves all three in balanced measure. \n\nIt seems that you are mainly convinced of things by authoritative scientific findings and logical arguments, and far less by personal emotional appeals. However, not all people are the same as you. Many people are mainly influenced by emotion and anecdote because pathos is a powerful tool. You may well wish people would use more logos, but others can equally well want you to use more pathos. \n\nPeople introducing anecdotes might just be them trying to frame the discussion in terms of the kinds of things that persuade them. If you really want to have a good conversation with them, you have to give them a little of what works for them, not just what works for you.\n\nAnd finally, it's worth considering that when it comes to debating social issues, simply citing statistical studies doesn't necessarily mean anything. Here's an interesting recent [blog post](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/15/trouble-walking-down-the-hallway/) about how nearly identical studies of gender-bias in STEM hiring are finding completely opposite results. People on opposite sides of a debate can both point to valid studies that prove them right. Of course that doesn't mean that anecdote becomes any more reliable, but it does mean that scientific ethos can't be the final word in every debate.\n\n(Because no CMV is complete without a link to Scott Alexander.)\n\nResponse B Author: Kman17\n\nResponse B: The inverse of your pet peeve - which I also find particularly annoying - is getting so caught up debating ideology or nuanced detail that you cease to see the forest for the trees.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I've heard self-proclaimed data/logic driven social-political arguments that completely ignore human nature or lack case study.\n\nAnecdotes have their place.  They make the issue relatable, and they may confirm or expose issues with a proposed solution.\n\nIf someone starts telling an anecdote, what they're *really* saying is \"I agree with you, here's an example\" or \"I don't see how your point solves this problem, for example\".  Try to respond to them accordingly, don't get mad and think of it as selfish or non-sequitur.\n\nSocial issues are, well, social.  If you're trying to persuade someone of something, the burden is on *you* to convince them why it's important and why you are correct.

I see people indoctrinated by an early age into cults, religions, or any belief system. This seems to counter the idea that we have an in-built guide of how to raise a child. It is unfair that these children should suffer, and be affected for the rest of their life.\n\nWhy should we be allowed to raise a child just because we have the ability to make babies? Or if its considered a moral right, why? In practise, this mean that there should be some sort of test/points system (I couldn't say the best way), to determine if the couple is fit to look after a child. Normally, since abuse is a minority issue, I would say that a blacklist system works better (fit to rear a child until proven otherwise), however, when you are dealing with someone's life, abuse is such a long lasting effect that I suggest a white list system.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: eggies\n\nResponse A: \nIf anything is a natural right, it's the ability to do what you, as a life form can do, which is reproduce, given that you can find a consenting person to agree that you're worthwhile reproducing with. Programs to forcibly limit reproduction have generally been very, very bad ideas (do some reading up on the history of eugenics).\n\nAs far as abuse goes ...\n\nI'm a victim of abuse. Not the worst abuse, but some bad shit went down in my childhood. And I'm glad that I exist. I don't think that anyone should be forced to have a child when they don't want one, but I don't have any regrets about the fact that I was born, even if my parents were imperfect people. Abuse is sad, but it isn't doom. It doesn't ruin people for life -- children are actually pretty hardy and capable of surviving some pretty harrowing stuff.\n\nThere's a lot that we can do to provide people with support and try to cut off cycles of abuse before they perpetuate themselves. But implementing a testing regime for parents is heavy handed, oppressive, and, well: eugenics. We tried it. Didn't work out so well, what with the racism and homophobia and the goose stepping. Solid mental and physical health care and a good social safety net are much more effective when it comes to helping the kids out.\n\nResponse B Author: Isabelle50\n\nResponse B: This has happened before.

It wasn't limited to political dissidents, often unwed mothers or those in relative poverty were targeted as \"unfit\".  The specifics of it are pretty harrowing.  \n\nChildren are meant to be raised by their parents.  Bonding and socialization happens at both a chemical and psychological level and is *powerful* for both parent and child.  The idea of carrying a deeply loved baby through a pregnancy only to have it ripped from your arms is horrifying.  Not to mention the psychological implications of taking a very young child from its parents.  There is a reason why we react so viscerally to the suggestion and why adoption is the exception, not the norm.\n\nFinally, were this policy to be adopted officially and publicly (under Francoism it was secret) I would expect some pretty intense civil unrest.

It's still illegal for two people of the same gender to marry. This shows that there are very many people who believe these issues are disgusting - disgusting enough for them to be banned. Now I disagree; but would it be reasonable for Reddit to declare these topics off-limits because they disgust people?\n* **Forbidding something can make it more attractive**. Take Nazi memorabilia. Illegal in Germany, but there's a healthy underground trade. [The BBC has an interesting article about whether it is acceptable to collect Nazi things.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8261002.stm) The argument seems to be - it's acceptable if I believe you're collecting it because it's interesting, not because you agree with the ideology. OK. But where's the line?\n* **If something is wrong, it needs to be proven wrong, not just hushed**. This one's a little political, but to my mind the darkest parts of the human psyche have to be shown so that they can be cleaned. If holocaust-deniers can't give their reasons without fear of persecution, they won't speak up - which means they can't be shown the evidence to help them understand the error of their position.\n* **Context is everything** Remember the man who was almost jailed for joking that he'd blow up an airport on Twitter? Text on a screen doesn't give us enough context to understand what's being presented. Perhaps the what is seen as anti-Semitic to one person was meant to be measured critique against the State of Israel?\n\nCensorship is declaring that you know better than someone else about what is 'acceptable' - but that doesn't stop that person believing those things. If we want to change opinions rather than just hide them, we need to have room to confront them in the open without fear of persecution.\n\nResponse B Author: Vehmi\n\nResponse B: It is anti-racism (Anti-asian white, black etc = no mom, dad, siblings, religion, ethnicity, history to speak of, and the imposition of slavery) that is evil.  The nazis were anti-slavic and anti-semitic because they were these things more than they were german.  The only reason you and your recent relatives were allowed to live is because it is only the anti-racism that was objected to not the racism.  You can no more be guilty of racism than you can be guilty of being a race so if you are guilty of anything you are guilty of anti-racism.  And which human rights?  What are human rights?

CMV.\n\nOp: Inspired by [this comic](http://www.akimbocomics.com/comic/2010-10-04-Eat_Shit_And_Die_164.jpg), which is exactly the **wrong** way to deal with depression, I'd like to posit a few statements about depression and ideally you can educate me and change my view.\n\n**1. Depression is self-inflicted**\n\nPeople who suffer from depression are usually not billionaires, bon vivants and socially esteemed high achievers, but those who made bad decisions in the past. They maybe didn't follow through with their education, they maybe didn't find out what motivates them in life, they maybe abused drugs and/or alcohol, they maybe put all their effort in getting meaningless sex. Now they're an empty shell and don't know why.\n\nYou might point me to some celebrity exceptions, those who seem to have it all, but still suffer depression to the point where they even commit suicide. But do they really have it all? Some abuse drugs, some can't form a personal relationship, some become arrogant assholes.\n\nYou can change my view on this by giving me statistics that prove that sober, highly connected, social, educated people are at the same risk to become depressed as drug/alcohol abusing, shut-in, antisocial, uneducated people.\n\n**2. Depressed people can pull themselves up by their bootstraps**\n\nFollowing contention 1, depressed people can find out why they are depressed and do something about it. They can find their passion in life, they can become healthier, more educated, gain social skills, etc. If you're depressed because you don't have a significant other, work towards that goal. If you loathe your minimum-wage job, get higher education or start your own business. If you are disgusted by your appearance, work out and eat healthily.\n\nThe comic at the start simply addresses depression as if the people around the protagonist don't acknowledge or understand it. In my opinion, when someone tells you that they're depressed, you shouldn't tell them to snap out of it, but rather ask: \"What are you doing about it?\"\n\nChange my view.\n\nResponse A Author: Rashiid\n\nResponse A: Your first point is incorrect. One of the reasons that depression is linked to things like drug abuse, \"bad decisions\", and antisociality is because people who are depressed tend to do or be these things because of their disorder. And, even if depression were always the result of the things you mentioned (which it isn't), the fact remains that once people are depressed they lack the ability to simply \"pull themselves up by their bootstraps\". \n\nThe neurology of depression is very complicated, but it's a medical disorder in the same way that any other mental disorder is. Can a schizophrenic just decide to ignore their delusions and make them go away? No. Neither can a depressed person pull themselves out of it by simply \"finding out why they're depressed\" and improving their life. Often there is no reason. Some cases of depression are caused by low levels of neurotransmitters, which is why many antidepressants work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain. Someone with that problem may not be capable of the proactive self improvement that you mention.\n\nResponse B Author: Kush5150\n\nResponse B: Your views are ignorant and not backed by any evidence. Someone who is depressed cannot simply just pull up their bootstraps. Saying that is no better than telling them to \"cheer up\". \n\nTrying to argue about depression when you've never had it is arguing from ignorance. Have you ever been clinically depressed op?\n\nMany researchers have dedicated their carers to trying to understand the brain and why it/we get depressed.

CMV.\n\nOp: Let's say a theft goes wrong and someone's son dies. The thief gets away with it because of some legal loophole, and the father decides to take matters into his own hands and kills him.\n\nI don't want to get into an argument on whether what he did was right or wrong. However, I don't believe prison should be used to punish people, but to reform them. If we can guarantee that this person only killed because of extraordinary circumstances, why should he be imprisoned?\n\nResponse A Author: Amablue\n\nResponse A: \nIt's also used as a deterrent. People will not do bad things if they get punished for them. If we start letting people go after committing crimes, then others will see this as an opportunity to commit crimes scott free. If I know I'll go to jail for killing someone, I'm far less likely to kill them. This deterrence prevents a huge number of crimes and saves a lot of lives. \n\nResponse B Author: carasci\n\nResponse B: Prison in our society has three main roles:\n\n1. Rehabilitation\n2. Retribution\n3. Deterrence\n\nYour point only addresses the first one: you argue that if a person can be \"proven\" (setting aside the issue of how) to have no risk of recidivism, they shouldn't be imprisoned.  A decent case could be made that there's little rehabilitation to be done, yes.  However, in that case what's to *stop* people solving such problems with violence and murder, knowing that they won't suffer any punishment?  There are a lot of people with dead sons, are we going to declare open season on the perpetrators?  Considering that most places have abolished the death penalty, it's pretty clear that we can't do that.  For that matter, consider cases of negligent death, where the perpetrator wasn't even truly at fault?  Should their life be forfeit?\n\nDeterrence is important, because it prevents things like the above.  Without punishment even in cases where recidivism is unlikely, there can be no deterrence.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Amablue's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I disagree with this pessimistic view. Since the mid-1990s, crime has fallen by more than 50% in America. The quality of life is increasing, technology is improving, and crime is falling. This idea that society is degenerating seems like a myth, spurred on by nostalgia.\n\nAre there any validity in these claims? CMV!\n\nFurther Note: some people are afraid that technology will and has led to a degeneration of values. Others also believe that technology is making people \"dumber\". I disagree with this as well. \n\n\n\nResponse A Author: hippiechan\n\nResponse A: I would be careful to conflate falling crime and increasing technology with an improvement in American society. Technology tends to always increase over time, and crime can fluctuate in a long-term pattern. Just because it's falling now, doesn't mean it will continue to do so indefinitely.\n\nAs for 'quality of life increasing', this is questionable. The United States has been experiencing [increased income inequality since at least 1967](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Indicators), which hasn't been made any better by the huge number of government cuts that were seen in the 80s and the 90s under Reagan, Bush, and Clinton. Many of these cuts were justified by claiming that \"it is the individuals choice to not work a better job\", which grossly misunderstands the point of income mobility: if you close the path to helping people move up the social ladder, their situation at the bottom will make them fail to do so.\n\nBesides that, there are a number of factors that suggest that the US is slowly slipping into decline:\n\n* The US has [the world's highest incarceration rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate#Prison_population), with 754 out of every 100,000 americans being in jail or prison. A great deal of these people are minor offenders, who are in jail for no more than possessing marijuana, being homeless, or being a minority in the wrong place at the wrong time. The US is also one of only a handful of countries with 'private prison' facilities, but by far has the most. These prisons have in the past been accused of such things as [bribing judges to send children to jail for minor offences](http://www.jlc.org/current-initiatives/promoting-fairness-courts/luzerne-kids-cash-scandal) (or in some cases, no offences), and [lobbying local governments to create new crimes to send people to jail for](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison#Lobbying).\n* The state of public education in the United States is in a downturn. Despite the US being tied in first with Switzerland in annual spending per student, many teachers find themselves spending their own money on supplies for their students, and the disparity in funding between some public schools is astounding. Some states also believe that they should be [teaching evolution and Christian creationism side by side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States#Curriculum), acting as though Creationism is a legitimate scientific view (which it obviously isn't).\n* American culture is becoming stupider and promoting poor behaviour. Hit shows such as Jersey Shore, 16 and Pregnant, and Keeping Up With the Kardashians promote binge drinking, underage unprotected sex, and general mediocrity. Younger audiences, which are particularly susceptible to media, are picking up on the behaviours they see on TV and emulating them. In 1996, American teenagers were getting [more pregnant than any other country with available data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_teenage_pregnancy#Birth_and_abortion_rates.2C_1996), and only recently does evidence suggest that this phenomenon might be going down.\n* Bipartisanship in government is increasing. Republican/Democrat bipartisanship is no new ordeal, but in recent years, especially since the election of Obama and the fallout of the Iraq war, it has increased dramatically, and arguably has divided much of the nation. The peak, of course, was the [2013 federal government shutdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_2013), in which the United States went without most federal services for a full 15 days because Congress and the President couldn't agree on a budget. The fact that such a thing can even happen in the first place is bewildering to people in most other countries (especially developed ones), but the fact that it came about because of such a sharp ideological difference between the Republican Lower House and the Democratic Presidency should be startling to Americans, and should definitely serve as a wake up call that the current system of government isn't working in such a polarized society.\n* The USA is experiencing the militarization of police like no developed country has ever seen. Mostly due to overproduction by military manufacturers, or from the sale of older equipment by the military to local police forces to minimize loss, local police forces are purchasing military equipment for everything from anti-terrorism to border security, and of course, curbing protests. In 2013, [as much as $1.6B in grant money was awarded to local departments for spending on military gear](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/20/police-billions-homeland-security-military-equipment), as well as [a total of $5.1B since 1997 through the US Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)'s 1033 program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1033_program). This has been criticized as excessive for typical law enforcement, and has been even more criticized in the wake of the Ferguson protests, where it has been used not just to quell protestors, but arguably to aggravate more protests, occupy the town of Ferguson, and quell dissent altogether. Militarization of police also shows a great distrust of the local government to its people, and makes the assumption that the citizen is the enemy.\n\nCertainly, other countries do face similar issues that are on this list. However, when combined, they cause a malady of problems in the United States that arguably are moving American society in the wrong direction. A country with such enormous production capability and human potential can do much better than where it's at now. However, people seem adamant in doing anything about it, especially when the answer involves higher taxes or more spending.\n\nSome countries, such as the Netherlands and Japan, seem to avoid this by coincidence: both are dense countries, and the need for cooperation and organization is high. In the Netherlands, no one questions zoning laws put forth by the government, because everyone understands the dike system keeps the country above sea level. In Japan, employees, no matter where they work, understand their position in society and are not often eager to demand more than what they have. CEOs have also been known to self-regulate their incomes to ensure that employees are also earning a standard wage.\n\nI would argue that much of the problem in the US is a lack of organization and cooperation between people. American's aren't as easily able to grasp communalism or socialism, or see them as beneficial, because both infringe on their individual liberties, on which the country is based. People need to get out of the mindset of putting themselves first, and think for a moment about how they fit in to their society.\n\nAs John F. Kennedy said in his inaugural address, \"And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\"\n\nResponse B Author: FormulaicResponse\n\nResponse B: Income inequality is reaching all-time highs with no relief in sight. A record number (highest in 36 years) of eligible people have dropped out of the work-force altogether. Part-time work is way up, deferred retirements are up, predatory lending is way up. Social mobility is way down. The average worker today is paid less than half of what they were paid in 1970 for equivalent productivity.\n\nAmerican education is highly unequal, with the bad effects being centralized in poor regions and communities, leaving educational deserts in much of America (there is a class of American schools known as the \"dropout factories.\") American tuition is up over 1000% over the last 20 years. Student debt is at all-time global highs in America and climbing.\n\nIncarceration rates remain near their all-time peaks and are highly stratified by race. Our healthcare system is one of the least efficient in the first world, with over half our population effectively priced out of using it. Healthcare costs continue to rise. From 1999 to 2010, the suicide rate among Americans, aged - 35 to 64 increased nearly 30 percent.\n\n[Confidence in American institutions is crumbling.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx) Church attendance and affiliation is down, marriage is down, divorce is up. Confidence in Congress is in the single digits. Trust in the American news media as an effective political watchdog is way down. \n\nI can find sources for all the statistics I've mentioned thus far, should they be required. Of course, we all know about lies, damn lies, and statistics, but I'm only trying to show that there is more at play here than simple nostalgia.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author hippiechan's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

The whole \"male-hating agenda\" feminists are a minority, albeit a VERY vocal one, but they bring the entire movement down.\n\nConcerning MRAs, some of what they advocate is true enough : rape accusations totaly destroy a man's reputation ; male victims of domestic violence are blamed because they \"led their wives to violence\", etc.\n\nI think that all the extremists in those movements should be disregarded, but seeing as they only advocate for their issues, they come accross as irrelevant. A new movement is necessary to continue promoting gender and racial equality in Western society.\n\nResponse A Author: Alterego9\n\nResponse A: And what would that \"equalism\" movement fight for? \n\nPropagating the belief that all people are equal? Well, if you would ask the average westerner, probably over 90% would agree with that statement. Equalism won. Huzzah! \n\nWhat you are missing here, is that feminism is not just a *brand name* that is trying to be as popular as possible, but an actual set of actual sociological theories about *how and why* people are as inequal as they are. \n\nWhen people don't see universally sexualized characters in video games as a problem because \"male characters are objectified too\", or don't see what's wrong with women in general earning less salary, because \"that's just caused by them choosing low-paying pofessions and at the same time hard or dangerous professions are filled with men.\", those people aren't saying what they say because they  don't want people to be equal, but because from their equalist perspective, *they already are*. \n\nThe reason why so many proponents of the \"equalism\" or \"humanism\" labels also happen to be critics of specific feminist theories about rape culture, or the role of the patriarchy, is exactly because they use the term as a way to criticize the very legitimacy of whether there are any specifically female issues still worth fighting for. \n\nBasically, their idea is that if we would drop the *specific issues* out of the picture,  and look at whether any minority is institutionally oppressed, they could just declare \"nope\". Limit equality to a formal legal equality, and drop the subculture-specific studies about what effects certain specific bigotries have. \n\nIt's the same logic as with \"Gay men are not discriminated, I don't have any right to marry dudes either! We are subject to the same laws! We are equal!

It is very silly for people to claim to be against feminism and not even know what it means that they are against.

So you're going to get babies from people who don't have insurance. If it's not covered you're going to get women and children who end up with even more healthcare requirements that could have been avoided if the prenatal care and labor went smoothly with medical intervention. It's probably not cost effective to exclude maternity care - you'll end up with babies with chronic conditions that need paying for their whole lives that could have been avoided. \n\nResponse B Author: CarnivorousGiraffe\n\nResponse B: Think about what the actualization of your plan would look like in a society.  Wealthy people would be the only ones able to afford birth.  All non-wealthy families would have to choose between not having children or being so financially burdened that they could probably not dig themselves out of that hole.  Most people want children.  It's a biological imperative, and having no desire to reproduce is the aberration.  What would most likely happen is that people would continue to have children in spite of the financial repercussions.  They would then be unable to support their families adequately, and would rely on government assistance.  Because of a lack of insurance coverage, most families would have to forego prenatal care and would deliver in emergency rooms.  This lack of prenatal care would lead to more health problems in children, leading to even more need for government financial assistance.  There would be more premature babies resulting in expensive neonatal intensive care unit stays, and since the baby would at that point already be born, insurance would have to cover that care.  One NICU stay can easily cost an insurance company more than a dozen healthy full term births, and lifelong medical problems resulting from premature birth or other side effects of lack of prenatal care can cost them exponentially more.  It's not necessarily a financially beneficial decision to refuse to offer maternity care.  Also, your desire for more pregnancies to result in abortions may actually backfire, because without prenatal care many parents would be unaware of genetic abnormalities until birth, and those that would otherwise choose to abort for those reasons will not have the option presented.

Prescriptivism rose later as scholars attempted to standardize the language. Before the internet, poorly educated people would not communicate through reading and writing text as much as through radio, television, or (cough) going outside and having conversations. The influence the internet has is causing more quasi-literate people to use written text to communicate. At the moment, it is possible to make a modest living writing on the internet while possessing a moderate to poor command of English spelling and grammar, not to mention the prevalence of social media. Lastly, the growing LGBT support of gender-neutral pronouns (including the singular 'they', which I hate for no rational reason considering it has a ~400 year history) will probably cast prescriptivists in a 'sexist' light. \n\nPersonally, I find myself doing a double-take when somebody uses to/too correctly, and have a split-second urge to 'correct' them to use the improper but common usage.

Why?  Simple.  Chrome spellcheck.\n\nLet me explain.  (This could take a while.)  Most people are aware that universal literacy is a comparatively recent trend, but don't necessarily understand to what degree.  Remember, at the beginning of the 1700s a full 50% of the English were illiterate, and even by 1800 that number was still around 40%.  Indeed, it wasn't until around 1900 that literacy became a clear standard (while American literacy rates were around 80%, this is skewed by almost complete illiteracy in slave populations; the rate for whites was around 90%).  All of this was kicked off by the widespread adoption of the printing press in the late 1400s, which drastically decreased the cost of printing.  Not only did this make reading material more accessible to the lower classes, it also created an explosion in record-keeping and bureaucracy.  This in turn led to the rise of a fairly substantial class of printers, who were not only the gatekeepers of written content but *also* had an extreme interest in standardization, because idiosyncratic variations made their jobs a pain in the ass.  By the beginning of the 1600s things had started to really settle, particularly with the publication of the King James Bible in 1611.  By 1700, dictionary writing had become a thing, and this is when we start to really see the rise of \"prescriptivism\" in the modern sense.  However, a lot of the time the rules prescriptivists used didn't make sense.  This was often because they were borrowed from other languages (ex: Latin) and didn't apply to English, but also appeared in cases where they chose an unusual (and idiosyncratic) variant as the \"standard.\"\n\nTo a degree, that's all tangential, but hopefully it gives you a better idea of how recent a phenomenon we're talking about.  Three takeaways:\n\n1. Prescriptivism in the modern sense is only about 300 years old.\n2. Universal (or vast majority) literacy is less than 200 years old, and really closer to 100.\n3. Prescriptivism wasn't the maintenance and codification of existing norms, but rather the result of purposeful attempts at standardization and imposing order on existing language.  It suffered \"growing pains\" at the beginning, and rules will still continue to change as language evolves.\n4. The primary trigger for prescriptivism was wider availability of printed material.\n\nYou correctly noted points 1 and 3 (though I'd say closer to the 18th century than the 19th, with portions occurring even earlier), but didn't address points 2 and 4.  (They're important.)\n\nEven when prescriptivism was already well-established, many people still couldn't read; its impact was mostly limited to government, law, and academia, because those were the people dealing with written work on a daily basis.  People learned spelling and grammar from other individuals who often had their own idiosyncrasies, and there wasn't a lot of access to reference texts.  Because most did very little writing seen by others, there didn't tend to be a lot of correction after their initial schooling.  Correction itself was also a very difficult, because (as noted above) most people didn't have easy access to a dictionary, language reference or grammarian. Changes in the average length of schooling are also very recent: it wasn't until the late 1940s that high-school graduation rates passed 50%, and they didn't reach contemporary levels until about 1975. In terms of the overall population, rates of high-school education among adults didn't intersect with rates of graduation until *around 2005*.\n\nThree takeaways:\n\n1. Up until pretty recently, even though most people were literate they didn't do much writing.\n2. The contemporary secondary education environment is literally less than 40 years old.\n3. Universal secondary education became a reality quite literally within the last decade.\n\nSo what does this all mean?  The big one is that we're dealing with a lot of rapid changes which have a lot of overlap.  Now we get to the core argument (sorry it took so long), which I can distill into some pretty simple point-form notes.\n\n1. Education attainment is continuing to increase, with more people spending more years in school.\n\t* Particularly at universities, which are more likely to effectively enforce prescriptive writing norms.\n\t* This allows much greater correction and homogenization, especially with a shift to standardized curriculums.\n2. People aren't just consuming more quasi-literate writing, they're consuming more writing in general.\n\t* Which, of course, includes plenty of \"gatekept\" literature.\n3. People's writing is much more visible to others than it used to be, and people have more opportunity than ever to respond.\n\t* This applies across the spectrum.\n\t* Also, more frequent writing (especially with spellcheck and grammar Nazis around) tends to improve skill levels.\n3. Correction is easier than ever, making self-policing a low- or no-effort proposition.\n\t* Phones, word processors and even Google Chrome literally check your spelling as you write; by default, this is very much a prescriptive form of behavior.\n\t* Correcting or checking even the most obscure word (even if it doesn't appear in a standard spell check or paper dictionary) can be done online in moments.\n\t* They're/their/there and to/too are the rare *exceptions* to this, because it's trivial for computers to check words against a dictionary but much more difficult for them to determine context-appropriate forms.\n4. Historically, greater prevalence of writing (even among the quasi-literate) is associated with higher levels of standardization rather than lower levels.\n\t* This is partly because low levels of standardization are themselves a barrier to literacy.\n\t* But also because higher levels of usage tends to lead to the homogenization of disparate forms even without a prescriptive body.\n\nSo, let's put this all together.  People are increasingly (formally) learning English through a standardized, nation-wide curriculum rather than individual teachers, parents etc.  Their own writing is more frequently on display to both the world at large and to educators with a vested interest in enforcing prescriptive rules.  Finally, their own language usage is continuously policed by technology, which is continuously becoming more effective at interpreting and correcting human writing.  In contrast, people are being exposed to more examples of \"poor\" writing.\n\nAt least on balance, I'd personally be inclined to suggest that the net effect will be an *increase* in adherence to (or at least understanding of) prescriptive spelling and grammar, with greater overall standardization of language.  In fact, I'd say this has likely already happened.  Remember, most examples of writing we have from previous periods are themselves \"gatekept,\" and those that weren't (letters, etc.) usually represent the work of people who were highly educated and literate.  This is a stark comparison to today: the last decade or so represents the first time in history that a large amount of casual, offhand communication has been conducted by text.  This makes comparisons between modern communication and older examples mostly unrepresentative.\n\nAll of this is particularly visible in your chosen examples: they're/their/there and too/to.  These two are particularly interesting for several reasons.  First, they involve distinctions not present in verbal communication (thus, they're text-exclusive).  Second, they're constructions that people have historically had trouble grasping, and many people still have to stop for a moment and think about them.  Third, they're mistakes that aren't caught by most software because of their context sensitive nature.  In other words, they're the one type of mistake that *is* likely to persist, especially in cases where people heavily rely on technology for correction.  (For example, Autocorrect regularly messes up both, while very few spellcheckers will catch either.)  In comparison, if you consider the overall rate of spelling mistakes in modern text to previous examples I think you're likely to find that in general the internet (and computers in general, really) have vastly improved the writing quality of the average person.\n\nThe internet is definitely increasing the pace at which language evolves, but only because it's allowed more and more communication between more and more people at faster and faster rates.  This does result in *changes* to prescriptive grammar rules, and it has certainly led to the rise of a new brand of \"conversational\" writing, but it's not going to eliminate either prescriptivism or formal writing any time soon.\n\nResponse B Author: Tjdamage\n\nResponse B: English grammar and prescriptivism is already dead. You even ended on a preposition. For about 200 years grammarians were advocating this rule, since is was the norm in Latin. It was considered the proper thing to do. Even without the internet the rule fell out long ago. \n\nOld English had a rich case system. That's fallen out for various reasons over the evolution of the English language. Hell, even before the internet, people who were not well educated were misspelling words. Going as far back as Ancient Greek, words were routinely spelled out phonetically for people without education. Why is it such a big deal for you that we are currently experiencing this.\n\nFurthermore, real-world employers will most certainly not hire people who are such poor spellers. That is why you see them predominately on the Internet -- that is the only place they are able to write so poorly and still have a shot. \n\nI would recommend that you cease reading so much junk on the internet and instead indulge in material from respected sources if it is such an annoyance. \n\nYes, the Internet may allow for the English language to change subtly over the next half-century but I highly doubt we will lose such drastic distinctions as you suggest in our language. I believe your argument is similar to Koine Greek, which was the language taken up by the uneducated. Is is a DIALECT of Ancient Greek. Similarly this 'Internet Language' is a DIALECT of English, similar to how British, American, and Maritime English Differ. \n\nWhich response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author carasci's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

Center-left economists including Paul Krugman have endorsed the scheme for various reasons. First, BI is an effective anti-poverty measure. BI also reduces inequality by redistributing income from capital to labor. Perhaps most importantly to some on the left, is the notion that BI provides people with \"freedom.\" Left-libertarian political economist Philippe Van Parijs argues that to be truly free, people have to have \"access to the means that people need for doing what they might want to do.\" BI provides people those means. Some have made a feminist case for BI. Philosopher Carole Pateman writes, BI \"would, for the first time, provide women with life-long (modest) economic independence and security, a major reason why it is central to democratization.\"\n\nBasic income, particularly in the form of a \"negative income tax,\" is also popular among the libertarian right. With a NIT in place, much of the welfare state would be obsolete: you could get rid of food stamps, child nutrition programs, public housing, cash welfare, community development programs, Medicaid, and a host of means-tested welfare programs. It would simplify the bureaucracy, and get rid of the \"unemployment trap\" that occurs under the existing system. Also, basic income advocates on the right want to give people the power and authority to spend money in whatever manner they choose: they dislike how the government forces welfare recipients to use their welfare handouts on purchasing food, for example. \"Benefits are often given in-kind rather than in cash precisely because the state doesn\u2019t trust welfare recipients to make what it regards as wise choices about how to spend their money,\" University of San Diego's Matt Zwolinski writes. A basic income, Zwolinski continues, would change that. Basic income is \"conservative\" and \"libertarian\" because it makes individuals responsible for their own livelihoods and flourishing. If they make good decisions, so be it, if they make bad decisions, so be it. But the government shouldn't force people to use transfer payments in a particular manner. Conservatives also like \"basic income\" because it would allow for less regulations on the marketplace: minimum wage laws could be gutted, labor union protections could be removed, etc. \n\nSocial democrats (on the left) and libertarians (on the right) often disagree on how to fund a basic income scheme. Some leftists prefer keeping a progressive tax system in place to redistribute income and lower income inequality. However, libertarians would prefer a \"flat\" tax without any tax brackets. One way to the two groups could come together is if they coalesced around a \"negative income flat tax,\" which is both flat but has a progressive effect, appealing to the right and left. Another possible way to fund the BI scheme is to have a \"progressive consumption tax,\" supported by individuals on the right and left. \"Land value taxes\" are also supported by the right and left. Moreover, there are also several liberal economists who agree with free-market economists that capital gains and dividends taxes tax savings, and corporate taxation is double taxation. So realistically, if the right and left came together, and had to compromise, they would settle on either a \"negative income flat tax\" or a \"progressive consumption tax.\" (And possibly a land value tax could be thrown into the mix). \n\n## Section II: Automation and Unemployment\n\nA big reason why people of all political persuasions are becoming interested in basic income is due to automation. Some project that structural unemployment due to automation and globalization will dramatically increase over the next several decades, and no government in the world has devised a solid plan to deal with this. They fear that automation may occur at such a rapid pace that the structure of the economy may fundamentally change, in which supply for human labor perpetually exceeds demand. Therefore, we need to decouple humanity from work, and transition into a society more based on leisure (which Keynes predicted would happen eventually). \n\nEssentially, it's not imperative that we build a human society based on work when so many jobs will be automated. And in fact, a basic income scheme may be the only way to shoulder such a huge influx of unemployed individuals. Existing welfare schemes weren't designed to deal with extreme levels of unemployment, and may be overwhelmed in the future. \n\n## Section III: Economizing on Human Labor\n\nI think these are excellent points in favor of a basic income scheme. However, here are my rebuttals. \n\nI concede that improvements in artificial intelligence and robots will decrease the demand for human labor in the short-term. However, I am not convinced that this will necessarily persist in the long-term and dramatically decrease permanent employment levels. Traditionally, innovation and technological improvements have lead to structural unemployment through creative destruction. But this was considered a positive development b/c human labor could be allocated to new enterprises. Economizing on human labor would improve the dynamism and efficiency of the macroeconomy. Retraining people or putting them through higher education has worked in the past, and has allocated human labor into new sectors. I'm not convinced that this won't be possible in the future. \n\nBut say technological unemployment does occur. That doesn't mean we can't combat if we act quickly. MIT economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, in their book The Second Machine Age, argue that while a basic income would replace the lost income resulting from mass unemployment, it wouldn't replace the lost \"self-worth, community, engagement, healthy values, structure, and dignity\" people gain from work. They instead argue that we should successfully enable humans to successfully \"rage against\" the machines through investing in expanded education and wage subsidies. One way to increase the supply of human labor would be to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (which kind of acts like a small scale negative income tax, but it works alongside other transfers and welfare schemes). We could further subsidize human labor, paying employers to hire humans instead of robots. We could establish a scheme where humans own some of the robots, and rent them out to corporations. Another option is to reduce work hours to accommodate more humans, while paying humans a wage subsidy. There are many options besides \"the human workforce will be hollowed out anyway, so screw it, let's accept that humans won't have to work.\"\n\nI disagree with the notion that human beings on a large scale will be able to have meaningful lives in a \"work-free\" environment that basic income would provide them. Work will be fundamental to humans in the foreseeable future. \n\nMoreover, say basic income is politically off the table. It would be in employers' self interest to retain some workers, or provide them some means with which to earn a living. If there are fewer and fewer people to actually do work, there won't be any consumers for the producers employers produce with their robots. Therefore, employers likely will too push for wage subsidies, lowered work hours, subsidies employment, and expanded EITC, etc. They wouldn't be okay with the status quo b/c it harms their profits. And moreover, automation will vastly increase supply, helping create an abundance of goods and services, moving our society closer toward post-scarcity. As a result, prices for good and services will be pretty low, so workers won't need as high wages to consume them. \n\n## Section IV: Why Conditional Cash Transfers Beat Unconditional Basic Income\n\nI also argue that it actually makes sense to have targeted welfare programs: food stamps, conditional cash-transfers, child nutrition programs, public housing, maternity and paternity care, sick leave policies, collective bargaining, free college, single-payer healthcare, etc. And I would like to see such a welfare scheme funded through a progressive income tax system (under which capital gains is taxed at the same rate as ordinary income), in addition to corporate taxes, and property taxes. I oppose the progressive consumption tax, a flat tax, and a land value tax.  \n\nFood stamps, SNAP benefits, other forms of welfare and social security are all a necessity because you cannot have a system that relies on the rational actions of its participants. People will act irrationally: they will not spend their basic income in a way that guarantees their well-being, and society will incur enormous costs as a result in homelessness, food insecurity, crime, and drug abuse. Behavioral economics has shown that humans aren't rational actors: rather they have \"bounded rationality: \"bounded rationality is the idea that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the time available to make the decision.\" In cases where humans naturally make optimal economic decisions, I am in favor of free-markets and against government intervention. In cases where individual economic decisions result in poor outcomes, I am in favor of government intervention to improve outcomes. \n\nInformation failure is a microeconomic market failure in which consumers underconsume or overconsume a good due to imperfect information. Take healthcare for example. For example, take vaccinations. In neoclassical microeconomics, they are viewed as \"merit\" goods that are under-consumed due to information failure. The net private benefit is not fully recognized at the time of consumption. People may not anticipate that they my get sick in the future, and they won't recognize the benefits to their future selves for getting inoculated now. Moreover, inoculation (via vaccines or another method) is a positive externality that has external benefits to society: if you protect yourself, others around you are less likely to become sick. However, when people purchase goods, they don't take into account external benefits or costs, leading to underconsumption. In the market for vaccinations, it makes sense to increase consumer demand for vaccines through mandating people to take vaccines. Such targeted governmental intervention in the market actually improves outcomes, and moves the equilibrium quantity more toward the socially optimal level of consumption.\n\nMoreover, a strong justification for the existence of our Social Security social insurance program is that while some people are rational actors, many others are not. Many don't exercise a lot of foresight: without forcing them to pay payroll taxes to fund Social Security, many people would not have income for themselves after they retire. People may not plan for the future and invest in private sector retirement or pension plan, like a 401k. Social Security a successful anti-poverty and social insurance program that ensures that people have some money after they retire. In this case, social engineering (forcing people to join a government retirement plan) actually improves outcomes in the economy and society through lower poverty and inequality, and greater financial security for elders. \n\nThat's why I support conditional cash transfer programs instead of unconditional basic income. Forcing people to enroll their children in schools, visiting the doctor, and getting vaccinations are successful in overcoming the poverty trap and facilitating upward mobility, more so than UBI. It forces people who would otherwise make bad decisions for themselves and society to make more optimal decisions. \n\nProponents of basic income argue that it's better to give people the freedom to use their handouts in whatever way the want, but we can have awareness campaigns educating people on how to improve their spending habits. To BI proponents, sure, recipients may portion their money out in ways that may not be the most reasonable, but given regularly cash they will still make rent and buy food. \n\nThe above is definitely true for a rational actor. But for a drug addict? The mentally ill? Will they spend their basic income on housing and food? Or will their BI disappear and meanwhile the safety net drops out from under them? I would rather have a conditional cash transfer system for such individuals, otherwise society as a whole will incur costs from their poor decisions.  Replacing in kind programs entirely with a BIwould result in some consequences that BI supporters are not considering.  I'm afraid that if the BI did replace public services, businesses would be there to snap up a lot of that money in housing or medical care or whatever else the moment that payday came around. They will be more exploitative for drug addicts than the government. I'm afraid that there ARE people (not poor people or rich people in particular at all) who will act irrationally based on mental illness or drug addiction or something else, who will require the forms of assistance that would be replaced by a BI scheme.\n\n## Section V: Does the Welfare Trap Truly Exist?\n\nMoreover, libertarian supporters of UBI/NIT bring up the \"welfare-trap\" that exists in means tested welfare programs. I did a pretty lengthy search and could find no actual numerical data to confirm that this effect is significant. There are too many conflicting motivations at play, too many demographics, too many differing situations to say for certain our current welfare system turns people into lazy bums who won't seek work. Most welfare recipients today, given the opportunity, would prefer a steady cash income and the opportunity to advance to a stagnant and unproductive life on welfare. They want to look for work. \n\n## Section VI: Traditional Welfare and Entrepreneurship \n\nThe traditional welfare state has shown to be successful in the social democratic nations of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and to a lesser extent, Canada. They reduce excessive inequality and poverty, while also facilitating upward mobility. People aren't trapped in poverty. Moreover, the traditional welfare state is more efficient than many people claim. The Roosevelt Institute's Mike Konczal argues that in the existing welfare state, \"there are relatively few programs and they are run at a decent administrative cost.\" Proponents of BI argue that UBI would facilitate entrepreneurship, [but it's not as if the current welfare schemes that currently exist in the western world discourage start-ups.](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/welfare-makes-america-more-entrepreneurial/388598/)\n\n## Section VII: Keynesian Automatic Stabilizers \n\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, many New Keynesian economists believe that transfer payments (unemployment insurance, food stamp payments, Social Security, conditional cash-transfers, etc) help macroeconomic stability by acting as automatic stabilizers. Supporters of UBI often criticize the current welfare scheme on the grounds that costs fluctuate with the performance of the economy. However, fluctuating costs makes sense if you use a Keynesian framework. Higher welfare payouts during recessions help stabilize consumption (and investment via the accelerator effect) during demand-deficient recessions by increasing people's disposable income; during demand-pull inflation, cutbacks in welfare spending decrease people's disposable incomes, which helps close the inflationary gap (when too much money is chasing too few goods). I'm not convinced that UBI would be better to our current welfare scheme with regards to acting as an automatic stabilizer.\n\n## Section VIII: Imperfect Competition in Labor Markets\n\nFurthermore, deregulating the marketplace through passing \"right-to-work\" laws and removing minimum wage legislation after BI is passed may worsen outcomes. Even if workers are given an income floor, corporations can still artificially reduce pay in oligopsonistic and monopsonistic markets. Within these imperfect labor market structures, minimum wage laws and collective bargaining laws actually help increase efficiency and equity. \n\n## Section IX: The Superiority of Progressive Income Taxes\n\nRegarding the funding side, I oppose forgoing our progressive income tax system in favor of a flat tax. Given that income inequality is rising in developed nations due to globalization, automation, and a host of other factors, moving to a flat tax would exacerbate this inequality. A flat tax would shift tax burden away from the rich, to the middle and lower class. It would result in the elimination of deductions may have a positive impact on taxpayers with lower income (such as the EITC). The government wouldn't be able to use tax code to encourage desirable activities, such as giving tax credits for making a home more energy-efficient (energy efficiency is a positive externality with which governments can promote sustainable growth that doesn't lead to environmental degradation). Moreover, government revenues would drastically decrease, making it difficult to fund universal healthcare, free K-12, and a host of other measures.\n\nProponents say flat taxes don't discriminate based on income level; everyone pays the same percent of income. This argument, however, assumes the marginal benefit of earning a dollar is always the same. To me, it's common sense that the marginal utility of the dollar decreases as income increases. The flat tax isn't regressive in the strictest sense (it's not as if the tax RATE is being increased as you go down the income-ladder). but it can be considered regressive in that the burden is disproportionately felt by lower income families. Necessities, such as expenses for food, clothing, and shelter tend to make make up a higher percentage of a lower income consumer's overall budget. True, this can be mitigated by allowing a rebate on purchases of necessities; since the value of money is still inversely related to income however, the system would continue to be unequal. A rebate would just be a band-aid fix. \n\nAlso in practice, many of the \"flat tax\" proposals by conservative politicians don't treat income equally. Yes, they may have a flat rate on income taxes. But they would lower or possibly eliminate taxes on investments, such as capital gains, dividends, carried interest, etc, that disproportionately benefit the rich. These proposals keep in place loopholes that benefit such top earners.\n\nGiven that the \"progressive consumption tax scheme,\" another tax scheme favored by BI proponents, would also invariably lower or eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends, carried interest, etc., I'm opposed to that too. Some economists oppose capital gains taxes, asserting that they are a tax on savings. We're engaging in \"double taxation.\" People already pay tax on their income, and then they invest some of their savings into stocks, bonds, etc. Then when they sell their assets for a profit, they pay an additional tax on that. Dividends taxes are also double taxation (corporations pay a corporate tax first and then investors pay a dividends tax on dividend payouts). From a theoretical perspective, it all makes sense to eliminate capital gains and dividends taxes, because theoretically, they discourage savings. \n\nHowever, this theory does not reflect reality, and higher capital gains tax rates haven't really affected the economy. Even Ronald Reagan raised the capital gains tax rate, and believed income from labor and investment should be taxed at an equal rate. In the real world, through a higher capital gains rate, you can make a significant dent in income inequality w/o many adverse economic effects. Basically, the economic distortions from \"double taxation\" that economists warn us about don't have that great of an effect on the real world. There is no significant statistical economic relationship between capital gains rates and economic growth (refuting aspects of supply side economics). \n\nAlso the lower capital gains rate could ironically create economic distortions itself: [\"The enormous tax savings available likely lure too many highly productive people into the private equity business, drawing them away from other potentially more socially valuable enterprises.\"] (http://www.vox.com/2015/3/17/8226915/rubio-lee-tax-plan)\n\nA \"progressive consumption tax,\" while superior to a flat tax (and less regressive), is inferior to a progressive income tax. The PCT would almost assuredly increase wealthy inequality: since wealthy would be consuming less and investing more, they'd  grow their net wealth even faster than the current pace. This is an unintended effect of the PCT, which would tax consumption and would incentivize savings. Given that automation will increase wealth inequality, it doesn't seem like a good idea to me to exacerbate the trend by gutting capital gains taxes and adopting the PCT. Proponents of the PCT argue that progressive income taxes discourage work due to high marginal rates, but the actual extent to which these market distortions occur in the real world are exaggerated a lot. Even if we had strong inheritance taxes to counteract wealth inequality, a PCT is inferior to a PIT, because with the latter, the government can still use the  tax code to encourage desirable activities. Progressive income taxes also protect taxpayer during hard times - when income goes down, the tax rate also goes down\nAs I said, I don't believe that human beings are always rational, so social engineering in certain instances can improve outcomes. \n\nFinally, I oppose the land value tax, another tax scheme favored by many BI opponents, and I instead support the traditional property tax. A land value tax would exacerbate economic inequality. If property taxes were were only based on the value of the land, rich people would buy small lots in cheap areas, build massive mansions worth millions, and pay almost no taxes.Then the working class people who buy small homes on small lots in the city (where dirt is worth more) would be paying more in taxes.\n\nI support a progressive tax system because I'm of the belief that you should pay what you can. If you can afford an expensive house, you can afford to pay taxes on the value of the house, including the improvements built on that house. \n\n## Section X: Conclusion\n\nI believe an unconditional basic income scheme, including in all of its flavors (negative income tax, citizen's dividend, demogrant, social wage, etc.) is ultimately a pretty flawed scheme. I view the traditional western social safety net as superior. For the reasons above, I feel that it's better for society to expand the traditional social safety net rather than dismantle it completely and replace with a UBI or NIT scheme. I support basic income in addition to the existing scheme (like how the EITC works alongside other tax credits and welfare programs), but I oppose scraping the traditional welfare state. \n\nResponse A Author: C-LAR\n\nResponse A: your position rests on the assumption that most people, given ideal education and social environments, have the ability to do just about any job as well as anyone else. this assumption runs counter to the available data regarding the heritability of psychological traits and limits of environmental intervention.\n\nthe reason this is significant is that there is a solid chance a great number of people will not have the interest or ability to transfer into these new areas of the economy no matter what programs are in place to assist them. even in the wildest post scarcity economic dream, the idea that each person has the ability, creativity, and will to provide valued service seems pretty far fetched.\n\nso what do we do to feed these people? ever more programs for this and that, further bloating our bureaucracy and keeping money from the people that need it to live?\n\nResponse B Author: jdw1066\n\nResponse B: A response I haven't seen, but seems important (at least to me) is \"porqu\u00e9 no los dos?\" Why are the NIT and traditional welfare mutually exclusive?

Especially the children of people who don't spend their money well, are they just screwed now?

Not even if she was wearing a tshirt that said \"I represent all feminists' or anything. It's a large and complex movement with many branches and many opinions held under it. I'd like to tell you why I support (and need) feminism in my life, so hopefully you will understand the need for it:\n\n*  I need feminism because I want to be paid equally as well as my male counterparts\n\n* I need feminism I don't yet have the right to control my body or get a necessary abortion where I live\n\n* Because I should be able to go in to a bar or pub without certain men feeling they have the right to grope and touch me when I walk past them\n\n* Because I shouldn't have to defend my right to be in my job or on my uni course from being 'just there to fill a quota' or 'there to pretty up the room'\n\n* Because I should be just as respected by clients as my male coworkers and not assumed to be a secretary because 'girls don't work in IT' or 'girls aren't good at logic'\n\n* Because my partner should be able to take longer paternity leave if we have a child instead of me being forced to stay at home if I want to go back to work\n\n* Because I should be able to buy a car without being asked if I need my dad or husband there to help me, and without being charged more because they think they can get away with it\n\n* Because my SO should feel just as comfortable taking my kid places as I would without getting judged\n\n* Because if I am ever raped people should ask me \"Are you OK?\" rather than \"What were you wearing?\", \"Why did you drink so much?\", \"Shouldn't you have known better than to [x]?\", \"Were you flirting with him?\", etc\n\nResponse B Author: Dragoon893\n\nResponse B: That's just RADICAL feminism.\n\nActual feminism is the support for equality, and in no way involves \"the beating down of every male you see\". It's actually BECAUSE of people like you, and your inability to tell the difference, that feminism doesn't have as much support as it should.

He was never incorrect that I'm aware of, and his points were good, but they weren't on-point for the topic of the debate.\n\nJust as Ham managed to not address most of the questions the moderator asked, Nye managed to not fully address the topic of the debate. \n\nLets be clear, the topic was \"Is creation a viable model of origins in today\u2019s modern scientific era?\" To prove this, Ham merely needed to demonstrate that scientific progress can be made while still holding a creation belief. With testimony, he did that. He also illustrated that one could believe that things like evolution and physics are driven by their creator. Nye, on the other hand, never demonstrated how creation belief hinders scientific progress - how it is non-viable. Only how it is wrong and silly. I think he could have won by pointing out that Ham's statement of \"nothing will change my mind\" is the antithesis of scientific thought and is why creationism isn't viable. \n\nResponse A Author: hacksoncode\n\nResponse A: I think the biggest problem with your view is that you have a very strange view of what it means for \"creation [to be] a viable model of origins in today's modern scientific era\".\n\nIt's not a viable model because it's wrong and silly. That's exactly what you say Bill successfully showed.\n\nIt has nothing to do with whether or not someone holding the view might be able to do science. That would be \"whether a creationist could be a viable scientist in the modern era\", not whether creation itself is a viable model of origins.\n\nResponse B Author: Cooper720\n\nResponse B: Bill's argument was that since you cannot hold the idea of young-earth creationism without a major suspension of empirical reasoning given the evidence we have this will ultimately hold science back since empirical reasoning in the very basis of science.\n\nI hardly see how that is the losing argument to \"So and so has a PhD and agrees with me\" and quoting bible verses as scientific evidence.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author hacksoncode's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

My understanding of the physical requirements is that they are to ensure a basic level of fitness, conditioning and strength.

A woman in peak shape will be more flexible than a man in peak shape.

CMV.\n\nOp: a) have as little narrative relation to other episodes in the series as possible, such that episodes can be watched in any order;\nb) more generally, depend as little as possible on knowledge of the season or series as a whole; and\nc) end with the status quo restored.\nNone of this is what I'm saying. In comments like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1yf0hw/i_believe_that_being_episodic_generally_makes_a/cfjzcqt) I use *Breaking Bad* as an example of a highly arc-based TV show that still meets all my criteria for being episodic. Please read that comment before making an argument on this subject.\n\n---\n\nIt's my impression that, probably since around the time that *The Wire* became incredibly critically acclaimed, the idea has been circulating that the greatest dramatic television is \"novelistic.\" The attitude is usually presented something like this: For most of the history of television drama, stories were contained to single episodes, which resulted in a pretty formulaic structure--for instance, police procedurals where every episode introduces a villain who is caught by the episode's end, only to resolve the status quo so the whole thing can happen again next episode. But then came ambitious, literary-minded shows like *The Wire*, which told long stories over seasons, and didn't pander to audiences who just wanted to be entertained for an hour.\n\nNow, I absolutely agree that making use of continuity is a good thing. Earlier episodes should inform our understanding of later episodes. Moreover, I also agree that there's no need to return to the status quo every episode. That said, I feel like in their attempts to embrace continuity and reject the return to a status quo, at least some TV ends up making incredibly formless and uninteresting episodes. I'll continue to use *The Wire* as my example.\n\nIn any given episode of the *The Wire*, we'll see many stories going on at once. Sometimes two will intersect in some way; sometimes they won't. Sometimes the themes of one will clearly relate to the themes of another; sometimes they won't. By the end of the season, of course, most of the stories will have intersected either narratively or thematically, but this isn't the case on the level of episodes. Furthermore, many of these stories can be described as *continuations* of events in past weeks; there is nothing to differentiate them from those events except the fact that they're happening later. This is to say that much of the episodic construction of *The Wire* is pretty arbitrary. There's rarely much to comment on about a single episode; all we can really talk about is where the story is now.\n\nThe problem for me is that construction is typically what makes a narrative work really interesting. By treating episodes as only pieces in one large story (the season), the show loses the opportunity to makes the episodes themselves interesting as works of art. The best art should make the most of its medium and embrace its constraints and limitations; by not considering the episode as the basic unit of television, *The Wire* inevitably loses the opportunity to *do* anything with its \"TV-ness.\" At best this is a missed opportunity. There is nothing really satisfying about rewatching one particular episode of *The Wire*, not because it has a bad story, but because it's only part of a larger story. It's like opening a novel (even a great novel) at random and reading twenty pages: it will probably be very enjoyable, but only because you're submerging yourself in a world you enjoy and spending some time there; it's nothing like the satisfaction gained from reading a great short story, which begins and ends.\n\nThis is not to say that *The Wire* was not a good show, nor that it never made good episodes. The problem, though, is that the really good episodes are pretty much just the episodes with big plot developments, typically (though not exclusively) the last two episodes of the season. To fans of *The Wire* (or *Game of Thrones*, which is structurally very similar to *The Wire*), do you ever really feel like re-watching *particular* episodes of the show that don't involve major plot developments? It's obviously very well made in many respects, so I can fully understand just wanting to watch *an* episode, but do you ever want to watch one episode in particular that doesn't contain a very memorable plot development? (This is different from wanting to watch a particular scene, which I can understand easily.)\n\n*The Wire* and *Game of Thrones* are probably the two biggest offenders in this department, in my opinion, at least among highly acclaimed shows that I've seen. (I sometimes hear this description applied to *Boardwalk Empire* as well, but I don't watch that show, so I couldn't comment. *Oz* also seems like it could be an example, but it was never nearly as acclaimed as these other shows, and, in my opinion its structure better resembles traditional soap operas than this mode of \"novelistic\" TV.) If you could convincingly argue that in fact either *The Wire* or *Game of Thrones* really *does* embrace the episodic format, that would change my view as well.\n\n(Please note again that I am not saying that arcs are bad and that all episodes should be \"standalone.\" I think shows like *The Sopranos*, *Mad Men*, *Breaking Bad*, *Lost* (at least the earlier seasons, and sporadically for the whole run), and occasionally *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* are all examples of great, highly \"episodic\" TV shows that also regularly had season- and series-long arcs.)\n\n(Also, if in your response you feel compelled to say that **Baltimore** was really the main character of *The Wire*, man, please first ask yourself if this is really bolstering your argument or if you're merely repeating a very tired critical cliche because you think it sounds good.)\n\n\n---\n\nOkay, I've awarded a delta. I guess I still hold a weaker version of the claim that I was making in this post, but that's a change. \n\nMore than half of the top-level responses were mostly responding to the claim that arcs are bad and all episodes should stand totally alone, which was not what I was saying, as I've repeatedly pointed out, both in this message and in my responses. If I didn't respond to you, it may be because I didn't feel like making that point again.\n\nResponse A Author: DaftMythic\n\nResponse A: I think you are making a conflation between a conceptual unit and a delivery unit.\n\nTaken to your logical conclusion you might argue that each page in any textual literature must take advantage of the page nature of the medium. So each page of the great gatsby must contain a completeness that embraces its pageness just like each episode of The Wire MUST have a completeness that embraces its episode-ness.\n\nSometimes though it takes a few pages to build up to those epic lines, dialog and scenes that we all remember In the book. Not every page can be a work of literary genius compact into itself, nor should it be. We don't go to a random page (after having read the novel) to read something that captures some essence of the book on EVERY page. We go to pages 203-205 where our favorite dialog between the protagonist and the love interest occurs.\n\nSometimes the leg work to get to those epic 3 pages with layers of depth and meaning takes 30 pages from when the protagonist first encounters the obstacle preventing him from being with the love interest and we get a sub plot involving the backstory.\n\nBut each of those 30 pages had to encapsulate something individually... What stress to be a writer. Just because I write poetry doesn't mean each poem has to be a hiku of the exact words I have to fit on a page. Pages are just a delivery method set in a series to deliver a story.\n\nSo the work should be judged by the conceptual units chosen by the author not the delivery units they are limited to. Sure maybe it would be cool if where each page is perfectly sized to the story being told on it: page one is letter sized, page two is post card sized, page three is an a2, page four is a fold out the size of a large map. But that is an unreasonable burden on the artist. He does not want to tell a story dictated by the size of paper her can get a printer to print on.\n\nYou seem to reject the idea of a tv show that is really just a long movie (13 hour seasons or 55 hours long go a series lets say) but why? The episode length in this case is just an artifact of delivery consistency, like the choice of size of paper. It's not intrinsically relevant to the work if the artist does not want it to be and the consultant delivery does not unduly burden most viewers.\n\nA perfect example is movie reels. Movies used to come in reels of physical film and many early films had a certain formula based on which reel you were in. The love scene on reel 3 the chase on reel 5 always finish by reel 8. That's fine but following or breaking that formula does not make a film better or worse. There are Hindi movies that still follow that sort of formulaic style, between reel 3-4, 6-7 9-10  there is always obligatory dance scenes even if it breaks the flow of the story the first half of the movie before intermission has a sort of completeness to it, and the last half is sort of complete to itself too, with an obligatory dance scene.\n\nBut reels are outdated now, the technology has moved on and continuous films of whatever length the author wants are accepted. Now that there is digital there is no physical \"reel\" and the pacing of the movie has more to do with what the viewers can handle in length and other style concerns.\n\nI think that what you are viewing with \"The Wire\" is the same maturation of the mediums. With the web I am sure you will get serial \"shows\" with drastically different  episode lengths that each stand on their own much better. From an episodes measured in scores of second to episodes hours long for the same series.\n\nBut for now even the \"Not TV\" that is HBO must fit the delivery mechanism into formats that are roughly consistent. This goes much more for ad driven formats.\n\nBut personally is rather the artist tell the story they want to tell as best they can given delivery constraints.

Were I in the UK, I would definitely say \"American Football\" and \"Football.\"\n\nTo give you some perspective, I am a football (NFL) fan, and in the past year I got much more into watching the games. I really enjoy watching football. When I was able to, I watched some of the World Cup games, and I did enjoy watching them, but the whole time I just wished I was watching football. Just to clarify, I really hope someone can change my mind because I really enjoy watching football and I would love to be able to enjoy watching soccer as well! I feel like there's more of a global following for soccer, and that might have some fun implications.\n\nThat said, I'll get into it:\n\n**Things that bug me about watching soccer:**\n\n* In football, people often slam into each other at full speed. In soccer, it seems to me that any accidental unavoidable contact results in a penalty. The penalty at the end of the Netherlands - Mexico game basically completely decided the game, and as I recall, it didn't seem (at least to me) that it was intentional. As I recall, it was almost unavoidable, but it decided the entire game! One guy was trying to kick the ball, another guy was near him, and their legs touched, and that's the game! It was so unsatisfying.\n\n* If penalties aren't being called on the players, it seems to me like the players are *constantly, desperately* trying to get the refs to call penalties. **It seems like every time two people come within a couple of inches of each other, one of them intentionally falls down, looks at the ref angrily, sometimes pretends to hold their leg in pain, and in the case where a penalty isn't called, gets up and continues playing as if nothing happened (in other words, they were obviously faking an injury).**\n\n* You can watch a game go on for 60 minutes and have nothing happen at all, then sneeze, and miss a goal. At least in football, you know when a play is going to start, so you know when you have to pay rapt attention. In soccer, it seems like you have to stare at the screen for 45 minutes straight for fear of missing a goal. \n\n* The penalty shootout feels like a cop-out. I know it isn't realistic to just keep playing for forever, but I was really rooting for Chile, and I was really bummed at how they got knocked out.\n\n**Things that I like about watching soccer**\n\n* Fewer commercial breaks. I really do appreciate this, although it goes hand in hand with #3 above.\n\n* Global community. In football, the \"Philadelphia\" Eagles is just as likely to have someone from Texas or Alabama or Oklahoma as Philadelphia. In soccer, I really enjoyed watching the players get tearful as they sang their National Anthems. So awesome!\n\n* Although I do think the penalty shootouts are a bit of a cop-out, while watching Chile and Brazil's shootout (as well as Costa Rica and Greece) I was definitely enjoying myself, and on the edge of my seat. On one hand, it is sort of a cop-out, but on the other hand, it is similar to a game being won by a field goal at the end of a football game.\n\n**Things I like about football which are absent in soccer**\n\n* I feel like football has more structure. There's more room for strategy, there is more variability between the positions, and there's a variety of different plays (screen pass, ground attack, long bomb, short pass, play action, etc). It may be that soccer has similar strategy and I just don't know about it. Further, football seems to have better time management. There's time outs, 4 quarters, time stops on a missed pass or an injury, as opposed to soccer, where time never stops, and the refs just add some random amount of time to the clock when the half is over.\n\n* There's more variety. Like I said, different plays, different skill sets for different players, touchdowns, field goals, passing, running, punting, etc. In soccer, there's only a 'goal,' which brings me to my next point:\n\n* There's so much action! In football, an interception or a completed pass is exciting. In soccer, both of those things seem to happen every 5 - 10 seconds. In football, a game where one team scored once (or zero times) and the other team scored two or less times, would be a pretty boring game. In soccer, 1-0, 1-1, 2-0, and 2-1 seem to be pretty common scores.\n\nSo, please, CMV! I would really love to get more into soccer, because I really enjoyed getting into football this last season. I've already got my hierarchy of teams I want to win planned out (GO USA! Then Costa Rica! Then Germany! Then Belgium! Then Netherlands!)\n\nE: Thanks to everyone for commenting! At this point, all but one of my views have been changed, and I've bolded that above. \n\nThe general take away from this, as far as I can tell is (A) I need to learn more of the rules of soccer, (B) I need to stop trying to watch soccer as if it's football, and instead watch it like it's soccer.\n\nThanks again!\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: Broke_stupid_lonely\n\nResponse A: \nPart of the difference is slamming into someone full speed isn't as big of a deal as when 1. you're wearing protective gear and 2. you're expecting it to happen. Football players take hits sure, but when you're braced for it it's just not quite the same.\n\nSoccer players flop all the time too, but a lot of their time on the ground is legitimate, since they play with their feet it's easy for an opponent to get tangled up and bring a person to the ground even if there isn't a lot of force behind it.\n\n\nThe thing about this example is it was a weak penalty call, but when the player was brought down in the box he lost a legitimate chance to cut in or pass the ball to a team mate and create a scoring chance. As unsatisfying as that is it's equally frustrating to have a legitimate goal scoring opportunity taken away unfairly. It's on par with a team getting to re do the fourth down after the defense shut them down due to a holding foul that seemed like it didn't really change anything. Because it might have it's unfair to not give the attacking team the chance to get it back.\n\n\nYes, this is a common complaint even among soccer fans. That said what do you expect them to do? When a player goes down, even when they know it wasn't a foul, their best course of action is to try and get the foul because they've lost possession at that point. Not saying I like it either, but the players do it because it works often enough to be worth it.\n\n\nI think this is a narrow view of the sport. Sure, no goals are scored but that doesn't mean \"nothing happened\". A perfect example of this is the Brazil-Mexico game which ended 0-0 but was a thrilling match none the less. The Mexican goal keeper put in some incredible work in that game (as he did against the Netherlands as well) that was just beautiful. There's a lot more to the game than scoring goals. Keepers make saves, strikers get past 3 defenders, defenders strip the ball from an opponent. Just like in football where it's not just about touchdowns, but interceptions, blocking a field goal, or getting a sack are exciting to see there are lots of things in soccer besides when the ball hits the back of the net.\n\n\nYou got that last part right. A lot of soccer is about answering the opponent. For example Spain is well known for playing what's called \"tiki-taka\" where they focus on passing the ball around and keeping possession until they can find a hole in the defense to exploit. In the Spain-Netherlands game the Dutch played a very physical game to not let Spain get into their preferred position and very effectively shut down that specific play style. Similarly Ghana is a team well known for their power on the counter attack to catch the defense off guard and the United States was able to play around this by playing more defensive than usual so Ghana was in possession of the ball more than normal but they never really got a chance to turn around attack with greater numbers. There's plenty of strategy involved in the line up, against Portugal Jurgen Klinsman used 5 midfielders to pack it in there and give the United States a stronger presence everywhere on the field. The manager also has to know who to substitute for who and when, since soccer is limited to only three substitutions per game it's important to be able to see who is or isn't working well and know when it will be most beneficial to get fresh legs on the field.\n\n\nAt the same time in football players can wait the play clock out and take time off the clock without even putting the ball in play. I'm not a big football fan myself and that's something that really bugs me, as in soccer deliberately not playing the ball to waste time can be penalized with a yellow card. Also, when the amount of time the ball spends out of bounds and such professional soccer matches have roughly 60-70 minutes of play time, which is the same amount as is on the clock for football, so the time management is mostly taken care of that way. The time added at the end of the half is also not arbitrary, there is a fourth official who keeps track of how much time is taken due to injuries that needs to be given at the end of the half.\n\nI've mostly already addressed the idea about the low score not reflecting how much action is in the game, but the one last thing I want to say is that the lower scoring games also make each goal a really big deal, which you can see by how much players celebrate when they do get one, as well as how crazy it gets when for the fans.\n\nResponse B Author: AbstergoSupplier\n\nResponse B: I'll take a stab at this because I'm a huge soccer fan and used to be a big football fan as well (having a TBI turned me off a bit, that's a different story).\n\nI think what it take to appreciate different sports is an understanding of the strategy. Football to the unitiated is just 22 guys running into each other, soccer is 22 players kicking a ball back and forth until it goes into a net, hockey is the same thing but the players hit eachother and have knives on their feet etc.\n\nWhen one learns more about the strategies of the game there's much more that meets the eye. In soccer one can learn much about formations (4-4-2, 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 etc) styles of play (counter, possession) and watch for things like overlapping runs, wingers taking on defenders 1v1, beautiful through balls etc. It all comes from watching the game. \n\nNow, you say that any given play something can happen in football, and that's true. But 9 times out of 10 when the tailback runs up the middle, its going to be a 3yrd gain. I'm generalizing a little bit. \n\nIn soccer, I'd equate a run up the middle to a pass between a midfielder and a defender. 9/10 out of ten it recyles possession, maybe opens up the defence and if they cock it up they can turn the ball over in a dangerous position. Likewise a team can be attacking, battering the defense to pieces, getting chance after chance until a good clearance by a defender lands at the feet of his one teammate left up top as an outlet, who then splits the defense with a thrilling run and scores. \n\nThere are different skill sets for various players in soccer too. Wingers are typically pacy and good at crossing. Defenders have to be able to jump and tackling safely is a real skill. Xavi is one of the best midfielders in the world yet he couldn't play along the backline ever. \n\nWith regards to scoring, I think the difference is that there's only one way to score points, put the ball in the net. There's incredible drama when your team's been dominating for 90 min yet unable to put the game away due to a goalkeeper standing on their head. The agony of watching chance after chance fail is incredibly exciting because the next shot could be the one. \n\nShootouts and cheap fouls are a bit lame. With regards to the first, there needs to be some way of ending the game. The NFL has changed the rules recently but as of a few years ago it was the first team to score wins the game. Basically relying on the coin toss. In soccer the game is extended by 33% and only reverts to a shootout if it's still tied. Shootouts seem to be the only other answer because playing longer is dangerous to the players health.\n\nWith regards to cheap fouls and faking injuries, I do agree that that's a problem, sorta. In soccer, the game is at a much faster pace on average for the players. When someone's shoved to the ground at a sprint it can be dangerous for them and their muscles. Studs up challenges can and have ruined many knees. Naturally the goal is to protect the players. There are plenty of cheap calls in the NFL too. Pass interference is one that springs to my mind \n\nEmbelishment has become a problem because often the referee's do not award the foul if it doesn't result in the player falling down. That's just a limitation on how the referee is as a human being. That's not to say that faking injuries can't provide great drama. A team that's known for diving can be a great villian. \n\nWith regards to timing and what not, I like the shorter more focused time span and lack of commercials, but that's mostly personal preference\n\nUltimately I love the game because of what it's like being a supporter of a local team. 90 minutes in an atmosphere that surpasses all but the greatest collegiate sports atmospheres.

I can't see it as a tool for peace or friendship or discourse or understanding; all I see is anger, rivalry, shouting. It reinforces the same sort of in-group-out-group \"You belong to a different tribe therefore you are bad\" mentality that leads to xenophobia, and from there, racism and overzealous nationalism (read: UKIP.) This sort of mentality is something we need to keep a lid on, I believe, if we want to have a more peaceful society.\n\n\nI'm aware, though, that there's likely a lot I'm not taking into consideration, and that my strong dislike for football has coloured my views no small amount.

If you really wanna get into it movies, television, literature, music and art really don't have any external benefits to society. I know lots of people (and I bet you do to) who look down on others because of their choices in entertainment.

I feel as though most people who go to college to \"study\" business are really just in it for the money - there is absolutely no passion about their studies to be found within. Moreover, business school doesn't develop critical thinking skills found in other disciplines, but rather cultivates a sense that the world exists of cutthroats and social Darwinism. Simply put, I think business as an academic discipline is not worthy of respect and, while lucrative, isn't aimed at expanding knowledge.\n\nI recognize that this opinion is a bit bigoted (of course, I have no experience studying business) and I tend to entirely dismiss individuals who study business.

One of the first professional areas that the brand-new German-style universities focused on were business: six of the biggest business schools were founded in this era. Treating administration, management, and entrepreneurship as scientific problems you could study, understand and teach were part of the broader approach to institutionalizing research.\n\n\nEh, I don't see the case studies they do in MBA programs as any more suspicious than the ones JD or MD students look at. Meanwhile, the actual research done by professors at business schools is in many cases extremely good. I don't think you can make a principled objection to either the students or the professors.\n\n\nWell, there are lots of passionless students everywhere in universities. It's a general problem. At least people who think their studies will make them rich, and are also very greedy, are *motivated*. Greed is a passion, after all. \n\nAs for business course for undergraduates - I agree, that's like vocational school.

Check abuse of power by the state\nThis is not a job that a judge can do well, because he has a massive conflict of interests. The judge acts as an agent of the state, and while a fair judge can often recognize when the system is not working right, judges don't have any incentive to seek out injustice within the system. In fact, they have strong incentive not to, because they need to stay impartial. A defense attorney has no divided loyalty, he wants to make sure that his clients rights are protected, so he will zealously investigate the state's conduct.\n\n2. Ensure that the accused is able to bring forward all relevant evidence. This is also not something a judge can do, because it requires someone who is an advocate for the accused. Most people accused of a crime do not know what is or is not a relevant defense. They may not understand what's going on. There defense may require investigation to prove, witnesses may need to be tracked down. A judge cannot be expected to determine when that's worthwhile or not.\n\nResponse B Author: JeffTheJourno\n\nResponse B: If you remove lawyers from the equation then the judges will be hearing from police officers well-schooled in the law (\"the legal/logical aspect of the evidence and crime\" as you put it) versus defendants who have no idea what the relevant laws are, much less the precedents that have been set by judges in the past.  They have no ability to argue their case.\n\nFurthermore the system you imagine relies almost entirely on circumstantial evidence.

Obesity is a real problem in the first world, and though it's okay to not look like a model, one also has to realize that eating an unhealthy diet and living a sedentary lifestyle are not okay. Yes, being confident and satisfied with yourself is admirable, but at the same time you owe it to yourself to be healthy.  \nI know a girl who is borderline obese. She eats crap all the time and isn't active at all. If anyone dares talk about her weight, she launches into a long self-righteous speech about how she's proud of her weight and she likes herself the way she is. She doesn't even realize that her lifestyle isn't doing her any favors, and that being overweight doesn't just mean that you look fat.\nCMV.  \n\nResponse A Author: dewprisms\n\nResponse A: You're conflating the movement against fat shaming and body acceptance with the encouragement of unhealthy living and/or promoting the idea that there is \"nothing wrong\" with being fat. You very rarely see people promoting and encouraging unhealthy diets and being inactive- the idea of the body acceptance movement isn't about that.\n\nMany people are against fat shaming and are for body acceptance, but are *not* saying that being obese is healthy and that people should all run out and get fat. The idea is to be comfortable in your own skin and be okay with who you are from a physical appearance standpoint.\n\nCrushing people's self esteem and telling them they're awful beasts for being fat or whatever doesn't encourage a healthy lifestyle. So even *if* rejecting fat shaming and promoting body acceptance does not promote a healthy lifestyle, fat shaming itself also does not promote a healthy lifestyle. It promotes the notion that it's okay to be terrible to people because you feel like it, which has been shown to actually have negative impacts- i.e. it makes people stagnate and keep making poor choices in life instead of encouraging them to better themselves. Because of that, rallying against fat shaming doesn't encourage an unhealthy lifestyle any more than fat shaming itself encourages a healthy one. Fat shaming is about putting others down and keeping them in their place, *not* about concern for the well being of others and helping them make better life choices.\n\nIn the case of your acquaintance, have you considered that it is being uneducated about the repercussions on her health and how to live a healthier lifestyle, or a self-defense mechanism that she behaves that way? When you get slammed for being fat all the time, often lashing out in return and putting up a false sense of pride gets others to back off and helps you appear to others that you are still confident even if you really are not inside. I hear \"I am proud of who I am\" and \"I think I am beautiful\" from obese people (myself included) but we're not proud of being *fat*- we're proud of *ourselves as a whole.* Until I moved past self-loathing for being fat and being massively insecure about it, I was unable to make progress to better myself and lead a better lifestyle, for example (and anecdotal evidence.)\n\nThat is not to say that there are not *some* people who are literally proud of being fat. However, there are a ton of people who are proud of incredibly ridiculous and likely damaging things in the world (people who are anti-intellectual and tout that they are proud they never read, people who are proud of being bigoted, etc.) Those people are typically considered a bit imbalanced, even by people who are in their same \"category\".\n\nNext time you hear \"I am beautiful\" or \"I am proud of myself\" from a fat person, realize that they are most likely not saying that they are proud of being fat and that they very likely understand the physical and social repercussions of being fat since it is constantly put in their face. They recognize that being fat does not mean you cannot be beautiful at the same time and that they are mature enough to accept and love who they are. And everyone deserves to have that.\n\nHere are some other CMVs about fat shaming:  \n[\u201cFat pride\u201d is absolutely disgusting, offensive to everyone at a healthy weight, and deserves to be shamed at will.](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1n3bx1/cmv_i_believe_fat_pride_is_absolutely_disgusting/)  \n[\"Fat shaming is a healthy and beneficial societal practice\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1s4s3x/fatshaming_is_a_healthy_and_beneficial_social/)  \n\n\nResponse B Author: Warbak\n\nResponse B: I would say that the uproar against fat shaming does not necessarily indicate encouragement of an unhealthy lifestyle, but rather a movement against a largely ineffective tactic. \n\nNegative reinforcement is generally a poor choice when trying to get someone to make positive changes in their life, which is what I believe most of the people complaining about fat-shaming are concerned with. Generally speaking, insulting a fat person about his weight won't encourage him to diet or exercise, and may even cause him to eat more in sadness. \n\nWhile there are certainly those vocal HAES/Fat-Acceptance followers who spew ridiculous nonsense about obesity being healthy or obese being beautiful (totally subjective), the majority of Americans (77%) are very concerned about their weight and want to lose weight.  \n\nhttp://www.foodinsight.org/Newsletter/Detail.aspx?topic=Americans_Concerned_About_Their_Weight_\n\nSo, I wouldn't say that being against fat shaming is being pro-unhealthy lifestyle. I would just say that being against fat shaming is pretty much the same as being against bullying in general and is simply protesting a poor tactic.

He said the only reason he's opposed to it is because there are times where he finds a small amount of marijuana on someone's person or in their car and he will talk to them about it, and then just crush it up outside and let it go into the wind. He said he would get in big trouble if someone did an audit of a hypothetical video recording of this. I still don't think that's reason enough to not have body cams but it was a different cop's perspective that I had not thought of.

Please CMV with personal anecdotes.\n\nOp: I have always loved nature. I've lived in the suburbs my whole life. I think that living in the country, or places with lots of nature is absolutely the way to live. I go to Michigan every summer, I know that there are lots of difficulties with that. But in less populated areas, everyone is kinder. The air smells good, farmer's markets are abundant and cheap, and no matter where you go there is a fantastic view. Even just a vast cornfield on a beautiful sunny day is so refreshing. I don't want a large house, just a small place with a nice view. I like sunshine and animals and camping.\n\nMy boyfriend wants to live in the outskirts of Chicago. All I hear about Chicago is crime, dirtiness, homeless people and anger. No one is close to one another. People are taught to never talk to one another. I know that cities give you more to do, like shopping and such. But everything is so expensive! Even a tiny apartment the size of my closet is outrageously expensive. Not to mention clothes, food (!!!!) and other necessities. Most apartments don't allow animals, while animals are very important to me. My boyfriend says that where we would live is nice and has little crime, but I was always brought up to think that there is no where without crime. Even here. \n\nEveryone I know from Chicago (excluding my boyfriend) has been bitter, sick in some way mentally, angry and generally unpleasant. While all my Michigan friends are very fun-loving, welcoming, warm and kind. Also, I've noticed city people are rather unhealthy, exercise less, and eat worse than those from Michigan. Probably because fresh fruits and veggies, grass fed meats and homemade breads are cheaper and more readily available. \n\nI just can't imagine how people live in a city and not go crazy! Do people not value peace there? Is it ever quiet? Don't people want to see forests and birds and spend time just sitting outside with the sun and relaxing? It seems like city people never relax.\n\nPLEASE CMV! I'm sorry if I sound ignorant! I've always been terrified of the city, afraid of getting robbed/mugged, attacked, etc because that's all I really hear about the city.\n\nThanks guys, again, sorry if I sound like a dumb suburbanite. \n\nResponse A Author: PrinceHarming\n\nResponse A: I think I'm qualified to change your view. I grew up in the Chicago suburbs, lived in the city itself for a few years and now live in the suburbs again. My wife grew up in Michigan and we visit her hometown often. .  First, the suburbs are very different from the city itself.  They are friendly, safe, great places to raise a family and close enough to enjoy everything Chicago has to offer.  Chicago is a world class city. Unbeatable restaurants, sports, museums and Broadway shows. Free concerts at Millenium Park and a free zoo.  There are things you can only experience in a large city, and you can do so safely if you're smart. \n\nMichigan towns, in my opinion, are stagnant. Nothing ever changes.  The same restaurants, same people, limited cultural experiences.   It feels like you can't grow in a small town. \n\nResponse B Author: NeutralParty\n\nResponse B: Resident of Toronto here. Was downtown my whole life up until a few months ago. (More outskirt now, but not suburban.)\n\nWithin an hour, usually less, of my house I had:\n\n* The Second City\n* Various theatres and music venues for everything from Broadway productions that travel to a full orchestra to the opera\n* Literally hundreds of restaurants\n* A large chunk of those restaurants offering authentic ethnic foods from every country imaginable. (Ethiopian and Indian food are the best if you ask me.)\n* An icecream place that did eggnog and rum ice cream for Christmas\n* Five grocers\n* Two community centres\n* At least five hospitals\n* Two universities.\n* More libraries than I could shake a stick at\n* A wide array of cultural events\n\nAdditionally I don't have to pay for a car - **huge** savings - can get just about anywhere on public transport, never have to worry about a septic tank, have access to tonnes of clubs for fairly fringe interests if I want to find like-minded folk, and can meet many people from various backgrounds and different countries with interesting experiences and outlooks.\n\nI love nature too, and a more wealthy me would get to more regularly, but nothing compares to extreme convenience and liveliness of a city. It's great to be in a place where going for a stroll can easily result in finding a festival in progress, finding a newly opened shop or just being able to get some *real* ethnic food, not just the Americanized versions.\n\nDespite living here as long as I have and even being so ballsy as to walk home at 2AM through the roughest part of town (statistically) nobody has ever done anything. If they did try something they'd have to be fast because even at 2AM there's enough activity on the streets a 911 call is likely. Worst criminal actions taken against my family? The change in the car was stolen when the door was left open once. \n\nFinally city people tend to be healthier than suburbanites and the country folk generally. Why? We can walk places, and often do.

High level of education, highly efficient administration effectively invests into the society, providing multiple incentives and angles of growth.  \n\nPeople have trust in their government, in their administration and how their taxes are used.

As others have pointed out, there's a strong argument to be made that culture is a major factor in your success. I think that if we're going to look for a \"best\" socioeconomic model, we should look for one that's more generally applicable - one that isn't tightly tied to a particular culture and a cohesive, homogeneous national identity.\n\nIt turns out that there's a model that fits that description quite well. [Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) looks a lot like the Scandinavian countries on measures of [happiness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report), [education](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Index), [life expectancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy), [economic mobility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_mobility), and [GDP per capita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita), and is [relatively close on income inequality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality). It's also an aggressively [multicultural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism_in_Canada) nation of [immigrants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Canada) which specifically [rejects the need for homogeneity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_mosaic). Because of this, the Canadian economic, educational, and legal systems aren't built on shared identity and trust, but rather on a sort of consequentialist pragmatism. Canada tends - in general terms, over a multi-decadal time scale - to adopt policies that work and discard ones that don't. In this it contrasts sharply not only with its idealistic southern neighbours, but also with the differently-idealistic political culture of Scandinavia.\n\nSo I think you should consider Canada's model as a more generally-applicable candidate.\n\nResponse B Author: HilariousEconomist\n\nResponse B: I think most people would agree with you that the Nordic countries have been successful, but why do you limit your prospects to only these small countries? Many other countries in Europe have similar levels of health, education, and measure close to Scandinavia in terms of both their quality of life and economic health such as Switzerland. New Zealand, Canada, Australia are all neck and neck with Scandinavia in terms of healthcare, education, economy (NZ being probably the best country to live in the world according to SPI). Why can't the Anglosphere be a perfect example of society as well?\n\nSecond I'd challenge your beliefs on feasibility. Not only must a country or autonomous region be small enough for local government to be smart and deliberate with their planning (which I fully support) they must also have the proper culture of anti-corruption, public spirit, and pragmatism. This kind of culture is conducive to an efficient and trusted state but doesn't happen everywhere (for example Chinese local government are very corrupt, inefficient with their money, and downright irresponsible, but Swiss local governments are the exact opposite). These countries also have the history of democracy, moderation, and pragmatism that many others do not (or at least not yet such as African, Asian, an d Latin American countries). Institutions, culture, and history matter a lot, so while the Nordics may give us good policy ideas, their countries are too different to export everything.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author kyril99's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV\n\nOp: I believe that there is no such thing as a purely straight or purely gay person, and that everyone is at least somewhat bisexual, but refuses to admit it to themself (due to religious, cultural, or other reasons).\n\nSex is sex and should feel good no matter who it is with.  Even though men have penises and women have vaginas, there are sex toys which sexual partners could use that would accomodate for any missing genitalia.\n\nLove is love, and there should be no barriers on who you fall in love with, either.  It is impossible for someone to only be able to fall in love with members of one sex because personalities are not exclusive to sex; thus, any person with an attraction towards a certain personality should be attracted towards that personality within any gender.\n\nPlease CMV!\n\n\nResponse A Author: ainrialai\n\nResponse A: You are describing what you think should be the case. How you want humans to work. While that system may be ideal, you have no actual evidence that that is the case. It's quite possible that there are many more bisexuals than we currently estimate, but there just isn't any reason to think that everyone is bisexual.\n\nWhether or not there's a way to make sex \"feel good\" between any two people does not change the internal feeling of sexual attraction. Many rape victims report experiencing sexual pleasure and orgasm as a result of bodily processes outside of their control. This does not mean that they are sexually attracted to their rapists. Sexual attraction is a personal feeling, while sexual pleasure is a response of the nervous system. I could conceivably be pleasured by someone to whom I am not attracted, though I personally feel the knowledge that they were not attractive would put me off sexually.\n\nYou say it is impossible to only be able to fall in love with members of one sex, but I fear you are letting your analysis be colored by your own experiences. In my experience, which seems somewhat typical, romantic love is a combination of personal attraction and physical attraction. I might \"love\" my friends, in that there is a personal attraction between us (an attraction between personalities), but unless there is a corresponding sexual attraction, I just cannot feel romantic love. Therefore, while I may be personally attracted to people of any gender, and of any physical appearance, I can only fall in love with physically attractive members of my preferred sex with whom I have a personal connection. If you experience romantic love differently, in that you romantically love those that you find physically unattractive, then you simply have a different sexual identity than I do.\n\nBasically, it comes down to this:\n\nDo you believe someone can dictate another's sexual preferences? That they can \"know best\" despite the clear statements of that person about their own sexual identity? You telling me, \"No, you're not really straight, you do like members of the same sex, you just don't want to admit it\" is like conservative parents telling their gay son, \"No, you're not really gay, this is just a phase, you really do like girls.\" Both are predicated upon the speaker knowing how the person *really* feels, despite that person's years of self-discovery.\n\nYou describe a world that might be better in principle, but that is ultimately just your unfulfilled ideal. I can say as a straight individual that if I carefully consider any form of potential attraction to members of the same sex, I simply come up with nothing. I am not ideologically or personally opposed to any such feelings; I would be just as happy to be bisexual as heterosexual. However, the fact of the matter is, if you believe that people know their own sexual identity better than outsiders trying to force their own societal ideal upon those of sexualities they don't find to be as \"real\" as others, then you must realize that right now, you are just as much one of those people as the pray-the-gay-away preachers that swear up and down their god that being gay isn't \"real\" or \"natural\".\n\nI am heterosexual. That's not part of my identity, that's not some internalized stigma I use to fight away conflicting feelings, that's not some point of pride or ideological necessity. That's just one of many simple facts that make up one complex individual. I can't speak one way or another to the sexuality of others, but *neither can you*. If you want a sexual ideal, I would offer up a world in which we all believed and accepted the varied and diverse sexual identities of others, rather than trying to impose our own ideas for what we think they should be upon them.\n\nResponse B Author: deadcelebrities\n\nResponse B: It seems like your argument proceeds something like this:\n\nYou fall in love with someone because of their personality and not their body.\n\nAny member of any gender can have any personality.\n\nTherefore, any person could fall in love with someone of their gender, as long as their personalities were right.\n\nBut this argument drastically simplifies what love is. I will have to as well because love is so incredibly complicated and mysterious that one can hardly speak of it without simplification. However I think my explanation will include a few important subtleties that yours leaves out.\n\nI am a straight man. I have been in love with women before, in a romantic way. And I have loved women as friends and family as well. I have never been in love with a man in a romantic way, but I have loved men as friends and family. If I meet a man whose personality I like, I will become friends with him. I believe that romantic love is not possible without some kind of sexual attraction (let's leave aside the case of asexuals for now. They're clearly not bisexual, in any case.) I have found that this principle is borne out in my own life. If I meet a woman whose personality I like and who I find sexually attractive, I may feel romantic love towards her. If I meet a woman whose personality I like and towards whom I do not feel sexual attraction, I may become her friend. When I meet men, I never feel sexual attraction, but I often feel the kind of attraction towards personality that heralds friendship. \n\nNow I suppose at this point you might say \"but wait! You still *could* meet a man to whom you felt sexually attracted. In fact, I bet you already have, you just didn't admit it due to religious, cultural or other reasons. So we will have to wait until you die to say that you never loved anyone of the same sex, and even if you **do** die without having loved anyone of the same sex, that could be because you lived in America your whole life and your one same-sex love was in Australia and you never met.\" And maybe all that's true. But you ought to recognize that making this statement renders your argument fundamentally un-disprovable, and therefore also un-provable. If you set yourself up to be able to handwave any counterexample to your claim, your argument loses all force and meaning. \n\nIf you can back off from the assertion that any counterexample to your claim is merely the result of lying or trickery, then I can CYV. Otherwise, I really can't, nor can anyone else.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author ainrialai's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

I think you're running into a lot of white guilt on this thread, which is a useless thing in anti oppression work. \n\nWhat people often ask you to do is \"check your privilege,\" which is sort of like checking your fly. This simply means that you have said or done something that shows that you are ignorant of your circumstances. Knowledge is power. If you are behaving in a way that shows that you don't know what you are doing, people are checking you for your own advantage: so that you can make decisions that are better for you. This is a good thing. \n\nThis leads me to a side point. If you and two buddies all agree that instead of competing with each other at the bar wooing ladies, that you would instead talk each other up, and while of course doing your best to help yourself, to help your friends too, then each of you will have three people helping you instead of one person helping you (yourself) and two people hurting you.\n\nThis can be done at a larger scale between identity groups. If people of different groups act in solidarity with each other, then each group has many groups acting in their favor, rather than competing. It's no longer a zero sum game.\n\nAnother side point is that the best strategy in game theory is [tit for tat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat). Even when competing with other groups, it's best to only attack in retaliation.\n\nResponse B Author: spiffyzha\n\nResponse B: Can you clarify what you mean by \"using it for the most possible personal gain\"?  When people talk about checking your privilege, nobody is saying you shouldn't make the best possible use of whatever opportunities are available to you.  The argument is more that you shouldn't try to get ahead by stepping on other people, because that's an asshole move.\n\nI imagine the only real reason you \"should\" care about checking your privilege--and working towards a society in which more people are afforded the privileges you enjoy--is if you care about other people.  Of course nobody can make you care.  Of course you can be as selfish as you like, and nobody can stop you.  You *can* get farther in a lot of aspects in life by being a total ass to nearly everyone you come in contact with. \n\nBut a lot of people have a desire to contribute something positive to the world.

The purpose of attending college is to receive an education. To admit students under different admissions requirements (because without them those athletes wouldn't be able to attend said college) is wrong, as it demonstrates that the college is not seeking to have these students represent them as an academic institution as they should be, rather as an athletic enterprise. \n\nAll students whether they are athletes or not should be held to the same admissions criteria as this will make the admissions process more competitive, and athletes who are able to get into schools without special admissions waivers will prove their dedication to education, versus athletics, as it should be. \n\nESPN Article: http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=4781264\n\n\nResponse A Author: Zaxop\n\nResponse A: Everyone here seems to be talking about the money aspect of things, but I think the educational aspect is a more convincing argument. Education does not mean academic learning. It just means you are learning something. College isn't inherently about learning academically, it's mostly about learning a useful skill or set of knowledge that you can build a career on. Many universities have majors for music, acting, arts, and all sorts of non academic things. So when you consider that many popular sports are million and billion dollar industries, it actually makes sense to have sports as a program in college. A successful football player in high school is not likely to rake in millions of dollars of ad revenue straight out of graduation. 90% of the time he will have to hone his skills and attract attention in a college football program. When athletes enter college on a scholarship, they are going there to learn a trade, one which is actually much MORE competitive and requires more exceptional natural talent and training than the vast majority of fields offered at the university level. \n\nIf you think that athletes are the exception to the rule in terms of admissions putting less emphasis on academic merit, you should interview some people to went to school on a music scholarship. It's incredibly different than getting a degree in biology.\n\nIf you still question the logic behind it, just try to imagine what the consequences of removing that system would be. All the athletes who failed to meet the academic rigor of students who are actually trying to enter a highly technical field would never be discovered. Sports would have less exceptional players. If a completely non academic alternative to college arose for sports training, you would be discouraging intelligent athletes from learning. Maybe you personally don't care about those types of consequences, but perhaps you can at least see how many people have a very strong interest in allowing athletes into college based more on their potential to become successful than on their traditional academic merits.\n\nResponse B Author: Gygsqt\n\nResponse B: Can I ask why this bothers you so much? Do you feel like this worsens your education? Or devalues you accomplishments to employers and others? It kind of just seems like you are salty because you didn't get special treatment.\n\nYou say that a students goal is to gain an education out of college, but I would argue that that is a by product of what they really want to gain; which is whatever they feel is best for them. For most students this is getting a degree/skills which will get them a good job. In the case of athletes is doing whatever lands them in a professional league. Engineering programs give students the skills and qualifications to be an Engineer. NCAA Football programs give (some) students the skills and qualifications to become NFL players.\n\nAlso you say college athletes but what you really mean is football players (and maybe basketball players). But the NCAA has dozens of sports which don't make any money for their schools. I very much doubt that college's are giving high school golf prodigies special admissions (but I may be wrong). You are talking about a TINY number of people, Alabama allowed 19 guys in over 3 admission periods, they have ~35k students.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Zaxop's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

You can't pick and choose which bits are correct and which bits are wrong.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: OverweightPlatypus\n\nResponse A: You're ignoring the fact that, according to the Bible, humanity is sinful because of Adam and Eve's choice to eat the Forbidden Fruit. Before that, there was no death, everything lived in harmony. Because Adam and Eve ate the fruit, they(and subsequently we) have to face the consequences. Its the result of free-will.\n\nYou also forget that to God, our lives on Earth is so miniscule compared to eternity. All of the pain and suffering in the world(much of it caused by humanity's decisions) is nothing on his timescale.\n\nThe reason he SHOULD be worshipped, according to Christians, is that he provided a way, even though the sins of humanity, for humans to go to heaven. Would you not be thankful to someone who paid your bail for eternity?\n\nResponse B Author: britainfan234\n\nResponse B: \nIf there really was a heaven then this isn't neccesarily a bad thing to let happen. \n\n\nSure God could fix all those things but half of them include the free-choice of man, something the bible preaches is important to god. If he were to stop them then he would be taking away man's free-choice, essentially making puppets out of them. \n\nThe other half are part of life. Life will have challenges and suffering and it is not neccesarily bad for God to allow you to face them. Again he seeks not to make puppets out of you.\n\n\nSo? He also created the entire population of the world. Death isn't even neccesarily bad. True I think this provides a bit of controversy in the teachings since God is infringing upon the evil mens rights to make choices but eh, after that 1 time God promised not to do it again. \n\n\nWrong, he banished them from his presence because they disobeyed and betrayed him. They went on to live and have children. \n\n\nI actually find this statement quite ironic since you are phrasing this entire argument on the bad side of God. You are picking and choosing. If you want to blame God for all these then you must all contribute all the happiness and everything in the world to him. That alone would make him worth worshipping.

Morisette is accessing the culturally shared vision of the woman who has been planning a wedding since she was a little girl.  The rain shows what little control we actually have and exposes how our expectations do not meet reality.  \n\nThe guy who is in the plane crash says \"well isn't this nice\" (verbal irony).  Also he has a reasonable expectation that his plane would not crash because that is a very rare occurrence, and it is the first plane trip he ever went on, but it crashed creating a mismatch between expectation and reality (situational irony).  I suppose the man expected the plane to crash because of his fear of flying, so it is not ironic for him, but the characters around the man probably expected that he would end up somewhere safe.  \n\nA traffic jam when you are already late is not very ironic I guess.  \n\n10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife creates the image of a person going through a collection of flatware thinking that eventually there will be a knife.  the expectation that a huge collection of flatware would have more than just spoons seems reasonable, but that expectation is challenged by reality (situational irony).  \n\nThe free ride when you have already paid is also ironic because winning anything beats the expectation of not winning already expressed by the character's buying of one ride (situational irony).  \n\nMeeting the man of your dreams accesses a shared and unrealistic (but nonetheless present) movie magic fantasy of falling in love.  This expectation is immediately crushed when you meet his beautiful wife.  This is cosmic or situational irony.  The idea that you are an important part of the universe and you have a fate or destiny that is significant is pervasive.  When the universe torpedoes that expected reality, you have cosmic irony.\n\nThe most common rebuttal I am familiar with is that her examples are more about bad timing or bad luck.  To that I say that there are many instances of bad timing or bad luck that create ironic situations.  Irony, timing, and luck are not mutually exclusive factors in any described event.\n\nA less common rebuttal I hear is that I am seeing more than what is there.  According to this argument, irony must be tacky and cranked up to eleven.  I disagree.  Subtle irony is irony too.  Also literary analysis through describing imagery is acceptable in both prose and poetry.  I feel that Morissette was unfairly criticized because of her gender, age, and medium (pop music).\n\nThe final rebuttal I am familiar with is that Morissette agreed with many of these criticisms and defended herself by admitting that she did not understand irony that well.  Her admission needs to be taken into context.  It was made after many intellectuals tore her song a new one.  She was very smart to not double-down in the face of such criticism.\n\nResponse A Author: eternallylearning\n\nResponse A: Rebuttal to rebuttal #1: Saying that situations containing bad luck/timing can be ironic does not contradict the statement \"her examples are **more** about bad timing or bad luck\" as the statement simply asserts that there is no or proportionately very little irony present in her song.\n\nRebuttal to rebuttal #2: The argument is that unprovided information is needed to make her examples actually ironic.  Saying that subtle irony exists does not explain why her examples must be, or are more likely subtly ironic than just not ironic at all.\n\nRebuttal to rebuttal #3: You're attempting to take clear evidence that you are wrong and find some reason to discount it.  This is called special pleading.  You might be right, but you've not even begun to make an argument to support your position.  \n\nMy own argument: It's undeniable that some of her examples are not even close to irony:\n\n\n\nAlso, this seems like the point she's trying to make with the song:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand it doesn't seem to really be about irony at all, just that good and bad things happen unexpectedly.  Couple all that with the fact that she's flat out stated that she didn't really understand irony when she wrote it and I think it's pretty much indisputable that she messed up.\n\nAs for your other complaints that \"Morissette was unfairly criticized because of her gender, age, and medium (pop music)\" I agree that many people didn't stick to arguments that were warranted and overstated the case against the song by claiming nothing was ironic at all.  While sexist comments undoubtedly crept into the criticisms, I think it's unfair to say that they drove the comments rather than turned them ugly.  It more likely just people loving to hate on something popular like they do with Justin Beiber now.\n\nResponse B Author: timlwalsh\n\nResponse B: Most of the examples in the song *are* just bad luck. It's not subtle irony, because it's not irony. And cranking it up to 11 doesn't make it more ironic, that's a common misconception. That doesn't make it bad, in my opinion, though. I think it is fairly criticized lyrically, but I think it's still a really great pop song.

Once it's made and released digitally, it's free for anyone to take.  \n\nWhen you print a physical copy of something (say, a CD, book, or DVD), you have a limited stock of how many of that thing are in existence, giving the tangible item some inherent value.

Make me feel bad for not having purchased any music or movies in the past 10 years.\n\nResponse A Author: skafi\n\nResponse A: \nYou're defining a \"current asset\" as a physical, tangible good; I think many people would agree this is a flawed assumption. Consumers don't purchase a CD, blu-ray, etc. for the physical disk. They're purchasing the art. \n\nThe vast, vast majority of musicians, actors, directors and so forth expend time and effort on a product with the end goal of monetizing it. Some artists only care about putting food on the table; some artists approach their art from a pure business perspective and try to make as much money as possible, and they have every right to do so.\n\nEither way, you are stealing product if the owner/distributor of the good is not setting the price at $0. They own the art, they set the price - it's that simple. Just because certain forms of art happen to be easily produced indefinitely at near 0 cost doesn't mean they are worth nothing financially. As you said, they're worth what people are willing to pay for them, and many consumers are still willing to pay. Even if *no one* was willing to pay even 1 cent for a CD, thus rendering it technically \"financially worthless,\" it doesn't mean you get it for free. If I owned land and no one was willing to pay 1 cent for it, you can't go ahead and claim it as your own - it's still mine until we reach a transaction agreement. The fact that music/movies can be produced indefinitely should not be taken into consideration from the consumer's standpoint. Perhaps it lowers the price the owner sets, but that's it.\n\nJust because you have the capability of getting it for free (and it's not *free*, as you're assuming the risk of legal action) doesn't mean it's financially worthless.\n\nResponse B Author: GnosticGnome\n\nResponse B: There are lots of things you personally don't buy.  Books.  Movies.  Yachts.  You might say that you *would* buy a yacht if you had more money, but the fact of the matter is that you have bought zero yachts last year, zero yachts this year, and are about to buy zero next year.  And the yacht industry keeps on making them to sell to people who aren't you.\n\nThe same goes for movies.  You haven't spent any money on movies recently, but GI Joe: Retaliation grossed over $40 million last weekend.  One day you might watch it for free, and by that time it will probably have grossed hundreds of millions of dollars.  Now, Paramount Studios could have released it in a different way that would be harder for you to watch, but stopping you from watching isn't their goal per se.  Their goal is to make hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nYou say that things are worth what people are willing to pay for them, and people are willing to pay much more than $0 for movies.  You may not be one of those people, but as long as there are people willing to pay the value is nonzero.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author skafi's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: From what I know, the birth control pill (used by 54% of American women) became available with no copay in 2010. However, ED medication was available with no copay for a very long time. I come from a country with socialized healthcare (and thus this would never be a problem), but I am interested in American healthcare since there is a lot to be critiqued. My friend who is American told me that he thinks that it isn\u2019t immoral because\n\n* ED can cause health problems such as depression, insecurity which can manifest into other health problems, etc. due to not being able to have/maintain an erection\n\n* Choosing to cover birth control pills is random and discriminates against women who can\u2019t use pills but may use other methods (such as an IUD)\n\n* That covering birth control pills if it helps with other conditions (PCOS for example) is fine, but covering it just so people can have sex is not\n\nThe reasons I think this is immoral is because\n\n* The whole purpose of ED meds is solely to be able to have sex. By not allowing birth control for sexual purposes, you\u2019re discriminating against women and men who agree to have sex the safe way. ED meds may allow sex to happen, but birth control pills allow it to happen safely.\n\n* The biggest issue my friend said was that ED can turn into other problems when left untreated, such as depression. My argument is that being pregnant and giving birth can turn into other problems. Some women (and even some men!) suffer from post-partum depression (therefore BOTH things can cause depression) and I think we all agree that there are far more medical problems associated with pregnancy than ED. Also, given that abortions are not necessarily available, accessible (in terms of cost) or even safe for some women, that isn\u2019t always an option to avoid those problems. \n\n* I believe it discriminates against the poor, who are the people who need it the most. We all know people are going to have sex, and when given the option to do so safely, they will probably choose it. By this I mean that we see higher teen pregnancy rates in states where there is abstinence-only education. Giving people the knowledge of how to prevent birth and giving them the tools to do so, will generally decrease unplanned pregnancies. Poor people don\u2019t have as much money to freely buy birth control and it is unrealistic to ask them to not have sex. I believe this creates a cycle of poverty which is immoral to propagate.\n\n* ED is primarily caused by lifestyle choices. Without addressing all of those things first, it is immoral to cover a drug that can most likely be treated through healthier living while not covering birth control, as birth control protects both men and women from a perfectly healthy fact of life (that people have sex).\n\n* Allowing birth control pills to be covered isn\u2019t random, since it is the most widely used form of contraception after condoms. I believe it is ideal to allow all forms of birth control to be free (condoms, pills, IUD, diaphragm, etc.), but this is a step in the right direction. In ranking from most preferable to least, my opinion is: both ED and contraception covered, only contraception covered, only ED covered, none covered. \n\n\nCMV!\n\n\nThe delta is also for reiterating the point that I was comparing two things that are fundamentally different, and when actually comparing analogous medical treatments, it is again an economic reason and not a moral reason for these things being covered/not covered. \n\nHowever, I still believe there is hypocrisy in the (sometimes partial) coverage of ED meds and no (rare) coverage for equivalent female-specific arousal disorder treatments, which can be cheaper than the male equivalent. Another issue to be discussed another day.\n\nResponse A Author: GnosticGnome\n\nResponse A: \nThis is actually untrue.  In 2002, 86% of insurance companies covered all contraceptives; the number has since increased. The copay has always been small (and has to be, since generic OCP costs only $10/month without coverage.)\n\nhttp://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3607204.pdf\n\nMeanwhile, only half of Viagra prescriptions have any coverage from insurance, and most insurances charge a hefty copay.  As far as I know there are no insurance companies that charge zero copay for Viagra.\n\nResponse B Author: peachesgp\n\nResponse B: \nAs someone who works in a pharmacy: at least in America that's so very, very far from true.  ED meds like Viagra are typically a high tier, thus a high copay, typically $25+ and they'll usually cover from 4-6 in 30 days and they hold very strictly to those 30 days, unlike other meds where they'll usually pay about a week ahead of when the medicine should run out.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author GnosticGnome's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

To me, \"active/helpful bystander\" (henceforth known as \"active bystander\") mentality is an irresponsible teaching because it is dangerous, relieves the school of a lot of responsibility, and weakens the success rate of stopping bullying.\n\nBeing an active bystander is dangerous because it redirects the flow of aggression from the previous victim to the person who decided to intervene. The aggression could be anything from just hateful words being thrown to something as severe as a life-ending/crippling weapon being pointed at the new defender (not necessarily a gun, maybe a knife or something else). It forces the defender to cover both him/herself as well as the initial victim. On top of this, if there are other bystanders who choose to be harmful (harmful bystanders), now the defender has to defend against 2 or more people. This, on top of the fact that the victim may or may not be helpful in the repelling of the bully, helps to ensure that from a safety point, being an active bystander is not the best idea.\n\nActive bystanders also remove much of the burden from the school. When schools essentially appoint everyone as a militia against bullying, it rids itself of much of the duty to detect bullying as it happens. As I mentioned earlier, active bystanders themselves may not be powerful enough to even stop the threat. Without the cooperation of the school, overall, people will have a much weaker anti-bullying effort. If a fight actually takes place, the school can just shrug it off by enforcing zero-policy and suspend both the active bystander. This doesn't even solve the problem, for a few reasons. The bully either a) didn't mean what they said/did and just had their emotions get in the way, therefore feeling like they were unfairly treated, or b) don't care about school or their peers and do this for whatever reason they want to. For the defender, well, they just got rekt due to their fail at bullying, and from the victim's perspective, they probably feel cheated for getting punished for something they could not control.\n\n~~My view could be changed if someone could find a better solution that\n1) repels the bully,\n2) nulls the aggression, and\n3) gives the schools some responsibility.~~\n\nPlease convince me if I got something wrong about my logic.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: steinvanzwoll\n\nResponse A: Your arguments seems to mostly focus on fighting, but [most bullying](http://forfreepsychology.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/types-of-bullying-graph.gif) isn't fighting. \n\nYou give some good arguments for not being an active bystander when a fight breaks out, but for most other types of bullying it would really help.\n\nI you call out a bully for being an asshole the bully will realise the bullying is harming their social standing, not just with the kid being bulied, but with everyone. This works especially if the active bystander is a friend/peer of the bully.\n\nOne danger of being a active bystander is that the bully will focus  their attention on you. This is why it is especially important that everyone is a active bystander, a bully can't bully ten people at the same time.\n\nSome bullies might not think of their actions as being bullying. They might think it's just taunting or might not realize how big the impact of their words and actions really are. The simple act of calling them out once might make them see their mistake.\n\nMost fighting involved in bullying is an escalation of previous bullying. If you stop the early bullying you might prevent later violence.\n\nIf everyone becomes an active bystander bullies will have to stop bullying or become social outcast and lose their power.\n\nResponse B Author: NuclearStudent\n\nResponse B: Telling children to be active bystanders is really an effort to make schools hostile against bullies. Bullies usually bully for a sense of prestige, power, or acceptance. After they throw a punch or a jibe, they look around themselves for approval or fear to make themselves feel better. When a bystander looks at a bully and says \"You're a bit of an asshole, man.\", that's more discouraging than a dozen anti-bullying lectures. \n\nWhen entire social groups of children exclude bullies for being assholes, bullies lose their power.

Taken at face-value as you presented them these liberal opinions would likely be a detriment to someone in a post-apocalypitcal scenerio. \n\nHowever, I think you are wrong in one (or two) of four **ways** for *each* of your ten liberal ideals.\n\nHere are the four **ways** in which I think you're wrong (these don't all apply to all of your 10 liberal ideals):\n\n1. You misunderstand the rationale behind this liberal ideal. If you properly stated the rationale you could show that the same rationale could lead to different behavior in a post-apolocalyptic scenerio.\nIn other words, liberals could behave differently in a post-apocalypitic scenerio than they do now without going against their ideals.\n\n2. This liberal ideal isn't a liberal ideal.\n\n3. This liberal ideal would actually be advantageous.\n\n4. This liberal ideal is neither advantageous nor disadvantageous.\n\nHere's how I think you're wrong for each of your 10 liberal ideals:\n\n1: Gun control advocates **(Way 1)**: Gun control advocates aren't \"I hate guns because they're guns\". Most gun control advocates argue against guns because it is safest to leave them in the hands of the qualified, as in, those who are more likely to make the best decisions as to when a gun should and shouldn't be pulled and fired. In other words, the police or military. The police or military wouldn't exist if society collapses, so most gun control advocates could rationally pick up guns until we could reestablish a police force while still being able to say that \"only certain people should have guns once we're safe again.\". \n\n2: Anti hunters/Vegans/Vegetarians **(Way 1)** : Not all Vegans and Vegetarians don't eat meat because they find it disgusting or immoral. Many Vegans and Vegetarians don't eat meat because of health, environmental, and cost concerns. Sure, there are some that don't eat meat because the act of killing animals disgusts them, so these would have to come to terms with hunting and eating meat, which they would likely be able to if confronted with starvation. However, Vegans and Vegetarians with health concerns could eat meat because you have to eat something to stay healthy (they could stop eating meat when addtional food sources were avaiable). Vegans and Vegetarians with environmental concerns wouldn't have to worry because there would be way fewer humans therefore they could eat meat without worrying that the meat industry was damaging the environment. And Vegans and Vegetarians with concerns over the cost of meat wouldn't have to worry because meat would be free.\n\n3: Socialists/Wealth redistributers **(Way 3 )** : I think it can be argued that sharing resources and not worrying about private property for some time would likely be the best way to reestablish society, at which time a more capitalist society could be established. It's difficult to tell for sure, but most humans seem to lean toward sort of a socialist group structure when in a dangerious situation because that is most effective and most consistent with our tribal nature.\n\n4: Pacifists **(Way 1)** : Pacifists feel that violence should be avoided at all costs and that non-violent solutions should be sought. That doesn't mean that they believe they shouldn't ever be violent. They could be violent if it meant their survival while still maintaining pacifist ideals.\n\n5: Cop/Soldier haters **(Way 2)** : I don't think this is a liberal ideal. At least not any more than Fred Phelps' ideals were Conservative Ideals.\n\n6: Feminists **(Way 4)** : So non-Feminist women wouldn't get raped? Only the Feminist ones? How would the Feminist ones be at a disadvantage?\n\n7: Race baiters **(Way 4)** : People don't just shoot other people because they have differing opinions, even in a post-apocalyptic scenerio. If you were to shoot someone because they spoke out slightly about how their race was oppressed, you'd likely be ostrasized by your group and likely killed too. Also, I really doubt a race baiter would speak out against anyone of another race if they were accepting of each other in a peaceful group of survivors.\n\n8: Intellectual snobs/Logic mongers **(Way 2 and Way 4)** : Again, I don't really consider this a liberal ideal. People who are snobby and elitist can be liberal or conservative. And I really doubt that anyone is snobby enough that someone else could rationalize shooting them in the face; we'd still have morals and we'd still feel remorse for the snobby person even if society went to shit.\n\n9: Anti-Death Penalty Advocates **(Way 1)** : This one is tricky. I'll give you that. However, I can try: Many anti-death penalty advocates advocate against it because there are other alternatives to the death penalty in our modern, effective society, such as rehabilitation. I think most anti-death penalty advocates would acknowledge that rehabilitation would be impossible if society collapsed. Therefore, they could still rationalize killing someone if there was no alternative (unlike in modern society where there are alternatives).\n\n10: Environmentalists **(Way 1)** : This is probably the liberal ideal that you least-accurately represented. Environmentalists are worried about humans destorying the Earth on a widespread scale, not about cutting down enough trees for a small group of survivors to survive. The Earth can easily recover from the latter, equivalently, the latter is \"sustainable\". Environmentalists are concerned about unsustainable practices, such as in those that cause permanent damage to the Earth. They wouldn't care about a small group of survivors cutting down trees (or eating certain animals) to survive.\n\nResponse B Author: TBFProgrammer\n\nResponse B: Primary point of contention: It is not the strongest of the species that survive, but the ones most responsive to change. Each member of the human race would face severe stresses that would greatly change their views. Their current beliefs are not a good predictor of their survival chances during such an event.\n\nAlso, it is worth reiterating that *every* member of the human race will have beliefs tested. Yes, that includes the most die-hard prepper. A collapse is necessarily incredibly unstable. Once everything starts changing at such a pace, it continues to change at a rapid pace for a few hundred years.\n\n\nMicrocosms of society would continue to exist and not everyone would need to be familiar with or carry a gun in order to remain useful. Gun control advocates don't advocate removing all guns. They believe they should solely be held by those charged with defending society.\n\n\nMost vegetarians believe it is wrong to kill unless you have to in order to survive. There is no actual conflict for them.\n\n\nA catastrophic collapse of society requires the authorities to be either overwhelmed or to disband. Cop haters are generally used to dealing with things without the influence of cops, whom they cannot rely on. They have more experience with the forms of society that would appear than most.\n\n\nThis is not a point of view, but an argumentation technique. It does not belong in this list (and is not a trait exclusive to either political party).\n\n\nIn a collapsed society, banishment is almost the same thing as a death penalty. Such people would be likely to advocate for this approach. Sure, banishment isn't exactly ideal, but stories where the banished person comes back with a vengeance are usually based on banishing someone who was actually an asset.

CMV\n\nOp: Due to the large overlap in population and revolving door between wealthy corporate interests and government institutions (including elected officials, unelected bureaucrats, etc), I believe that corporatism and state control cause the same degree of negative effects and are equally dangerous to the vast majority of people who are not part of the wealthy elite.\n\nIn the United States, we are presented with a false dichotomy between right-wing \"corporatists\" and left-wing \"statists\", when both sides represent entrenched, powerful interests. The interests of both sides (corporations and government entities) are similarly at odds with those of the majority of the population, and in many cases the corporate interests and statist interests are literally the same people with the same agendas.\n\nIt is often argued that the role of democracy is to ensure that government works toward the common good, but this ignores an important fact: everyone has one vote, but some people have one vote and billions of dollars with which to influence government. Government will inevitably serve the interests of those who have one vote and billions of dollars over those who just have one vote.\n\nThe American right argues that state intervention in the economy and society as a whole is often immoral, unfair, and damaging -- I think this is correct. The American left argues that corporations have the same negative effects, and I think this is correct as well.\n\nI think that the primary cause of this problem is the incestuous relationship between corporations and government (\"K Street\"), but I also think that further regulations on government behavior to limit this kind of corruption would be necessarily ineffective, due to the intrinsic connection between wealth and political power.\n\nI am most familiar with American politics, so those are the examples I have used here, but I don't think this problem is uniquely American. I would like to be convinced that there is a way that we can limit this destructive tendency, but I cannot envision a way that this can be done (at least not without having hugely destructive effects on the rest of society). At the minimum, it would be helpful if I had a reason to believe that one threat or the other was greater, so that I could choose a \"side\" to try to make things better. Please CMV.\n\nResponse A Author: FaustTheBird\n\nResponse A: You've got a strange way of phrasing this post. It sounds like what you're really saying is that concentrated power in the hands of the few is dangerous. In most democratic countries, I would think this is the normative position to hold with respect to the topic. We could try to C your V on this, but I don't think that's what you're asking. We're taking this claim (Concentrated power in the hands of the few is dangerous) as axiomatically true and starting from there.\n\nSo then you're saying that corporations and governments are equally dangerous because they both represent forms of our axiomatic foundation (above). So what can be done to change your view?\n\n1) We could attempt to show that either Corporate-person-hood or Government are not concentrations of power in the hands of the few.  \n2) We could attempt to show that there are more people in one class or the other and therefore power is more distributed in one form versus the other. This would appear to give us a metric that allows us to demonstrably say one meets the criteria more than the other.  \n3) We could attempt to show that the power being concentrated is more or less dangerous for one class or the other. In this formulation, we'll try to address the various powers of each class and then attempt to rank them by risk value.  \n4) We could also try to reformulate your position for you and state that you are attempting to figure out a better system than either of those currently discussed, at which point we can try to point to changes we can make (like anarchy, communism, varying degrees of regulation, etc). I think this spirals into debate and wouldn't be helpful.  \n\nSo let's talk about (1).  \nThe U.S. Representative Democracy allows every citizen of voting age to cast one vote per elected seat. That's a pretty wide distribution of power. Corporations on the other hand allow anyone with money, regardless of citizenship status, felony status, or age to participate in the results of the corporation (goods and services) at any time, as many times as they want, with as much volume as they want, limited by their available funds. Additionally, public corporations allow anyone from anywhere to obtain voting rights with regard to the direction of any corporation in proportion to the amount of money they have relative to others participating. Both of these systems are representative and not direct, so ultimately both systems place true decision making power in the hands of the few, even if there are mechanisms for distributing that power to the many (voting, cashflow, etc). So it looks like (1) stands as is and we must try something else.\n\n(2)  \nClearly, there are more purchasers of corporate goods than voters for any single government. A corporation can sell to all 50 states but a state government only has voters from that state. The US Federal government excludes anyone under 18, many felons, and non-citizens. By contrast, travelers, teenagers, non-citizen immigrants, and even people half-a-world away can participate in corporations either through purchasing power or through owning shares. So it would seem that in this sense, corporations give power to a wider group of individuals than governments. But is that a good thing? What if the actions of a corporation are negative for only one segment of the population but beneficial to the rest? Major tyranny of the majority! The US system is designed to divide people into polities by geography partly because it gives those people more autonomy than being awash in a mass-majority-rules situation. If there were no state, county, or town governments, 300 millions Americans would vote exactly where to put our uranium waste and wherever it went, those people would just have to deal. So here's an interesting paradox: spreading the power out to more people results in those people being disempowered relative to a smaller government with less participants deciding their actions for themselves. Hmmm. Add on the fact that economic power is concentrated in the hands of the few already, and we start to see that one vote per person matters a lot when calculating the level of power concentration and its impact on decision making.\n\nI won't go on because I don't have the time. Perhaps someone else can pick up the last 2 points. But I would like to make this point. Governments are ultimately systems for groups of people to make collective decisions regarding issues that effect them. These issues are not only economic in nature and they are not measured in dollars. There is a lot of value in reducing the number of important decisions you have to make daily and we have found that representative democracy to be better than direct democracy because of that. We must always work together to govern ourselves better and often that means less regulation not more, and sometimes it means more regulation not less. I propose that only representative democratic government can provide the necessary distribution of power and control to the governed. It is possible that the current US system is failing to facilitate this distribution, it may be the case the the US system is poorly constructed from the foundation and inevitably leads to concentration of power away from the governed. But I do not think corporations can provide the same level of power distribution, not without collective decisions by a governing body mandating such a structure (which would ultimately be some form of collective ownership like communism). Therefore, I think that the dangers of corporations will vary on the circumstance throughout the ages but that the mechanisms for control will not trend towards distributed decision making in the best interests of the governed. In contrast, the dangers of governments will not vary much over the ages (violence, economic redistribution, oppression, suppression, etc) but that the mechanisms for control and distribution of power to the governed will continually evolve (at the behest of the governed) and we will design governments to our liking because governments truly live and die by the actions of the governed (and the violence of other governments, but that's another story).\n\n**tl;dr: Governments will always wield more dangerous powers but always provide the mechanisms for wider and wider distribution of those powers to the many. Corporations will always wield less dangerous power (though sometimes only slightly less dangerous) and will always minimize distributed decision making as it is antithetical to the goal of maximal efficiency.**\n\nResponse B Author: deten\n\nResponse B: We have 190 or so economic experiments going on, based on the number of countries in the world.  They are not isolated nor are they perfect... but we are able to look at these 190ish countries and determine things that are working well and things that are working poorly.\n\n**~~The problem with your question is that you don't reference the country which one you are talking about, I am going to assume you are from the USA, but the responses here depend on where you are!~~  Corrected by you :) **\n\nSome countries, like Norway, have higher GDP per capita, higher quality of life, longer lifespans and individual freedom etc etc relative to the US.\n\nSome countries, like Haiti, have disastrous rankings.\n\nWhat we see is that countries with strong governments, tend to have much better quality of life.  Now there are all sorts of unique examples, such as Switzerland, which is a money haven, that create a lot of value by having a pocket of little regulation... but the country overall is not that way!\n\nCountries like Norway, Sweden, Australia, Iceland, Denmark, Finland... some of the highest ranked countries in the world, have strong governments.\n\nYou also see these countries as much more peaceful, less crime, less police brutality, strong personal freedoms...\n\nThe United States, is somewhat unique on this list, in one factor that makes our quality of life skewed (and in fact, many rating systems have an \"equality adjusted\" quality of life to deal with this)... that is that the US is not an equal country.  For better or for worse, and many Americans would say that is the right way to have things.  I won't argue about whether its right or wrong, but we cannot deny that there are negative effects that come from an unequal society.\n\nWhile there are many ways to equate Governments with Corporations, there are far more ways to explain their differences:\n\n* Governments are meant to provide(varying degrees) of a fair playing ground, Corporations are intended to make a profit.\n\n* Governments are staffed fully off of its electorate, who decide its future through whom they vote for, Corporations are staffed by a variety of ways, but the most important difference is the people who consume corporations product tend to not have a vote on who is going to be CEO/etc, in fact most employees don't even have a vote.\n\n* Governments are far less affected by the rise and fall of a corporation, than a corporation is to the rise and fall of a government.\n\n\nIt comes down to what type of government, when a people vote for a government that upholds standards of peace, equality, transparency, quality of life... then this government will result in a more peaceful, transparent, equal, healthy life of its population.\n\nIf a population votes based on the lowest common denominator, ignoring the most relevant issues, for issues of mass appeal (abortion, religion, fringe examples of corruption/abuse...) then the important issues such as privacy, health, national development get lost.\n\nOne final addition, the biggest difference between the US and most top rated countries is that the US has Bloc Voting instead of Proportional Representation.\n\nWhat this means, in short, is that of the total population, say 50% of them vote, and another 40% vote republican and 39% vote democrat.  This means that 20% of the population determining 100% of the representation.  What this does, is it forces groups who would not normally work together, to try to group up, and appeal to the largest margin.  So they can get that extra 1% and gain 100% of the representation.\n\nIn proportional representation, as you might suggest, you receive seats based on the % of electorate that vote for you.  Get 40% of the votes?  You get 40% of the representation.\n\nThis allows a larger spectrum of political parties, and in turn a large buffet for those going to vote to chose from.\n\nWant universal healthcare but don't like illegal immigration?  You're fucked in the US's current system.\n\n**In conclusion, in reality there are plenty of countries that have strong governments and uphold strong standards of human life that reveal your hypothesis' flaws.  Governments and Corporations have fundamentally different goals, and equating them only works in certain specific instances, and does not apply as a blanket statement**Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author FaustTheBird's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

While I haven't seen them all (mostly the Daniel Craig and Pierce Brosnan ones), criticism exists for all movies in this regard. \n\n[Taking it from this article](http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/james-bond-spectre-empire/), it seems their problem is the objectifiction of Bond's one night stands on the basis that he just sleeps with them and then forgets about them. But I don't see how that can be.considered objectification, since both parties agree to have consensual sex and Bond never makes any hints on wanting to build a relationship. Just letting things happen. He does use the woman for sexual gratification, but so does the woman with him. There's no way one doesn't \"use\" someone as something if this is what they mean.\n\nAnother point is that he is cold and uncaring towards his ONS getting killed, but it seems this could be explained more succinctly through Bond's job: he's a spy, a trained soldier who is put in danger's way all the time to defend his country and that through the years he has become numb to death. He doesn't dwell on those deaths because it would be detrimental to his mission, make him lose focus on his objective.

The audience sees Bond sleep with beautiful woman after beautiful woman who serves no other purpose than, as people have mentioned, to be nailed and either betray him or be killed. Other characters serve a purpose to the story overall, but nearly every single female character, save Judi Dench, has a role that focuses soley on her being a sex object. They're there to be seen by the audience as objects, not characters - it's even in the names. Pussy Galore, Plenty O\nToole, Holly Goodhead, Octopussym Molly Warmflesh.\n\nBond is meant to be seen as a suave, powerful, and all around man-you-want-to-be-like. The sexism shows in that one of the traits of this enviable man is that he goes through women like tissue paper.\n\nIf he's so concerned with things that are detrimental to his mission, maybe he should focus on the mission instead of the sexy lady who's totally not going to stab him in the back later (because having half the Bond girls fall into the \"treacherous Delilah\" trope isn't at all sexist, either.)Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author NuclearStudent's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

For example, many feel that the America's FPTP system is to blame, as it reduces electoral competition as per Duverger's law. Others feel that a more powerful criticism is that single-member districts allow legislators to engage in partisan gerrymandering, diluting the voter strength of the opposition party. Some blame draconinan Voter ID laws meant to disenfranchise certain demographic groups. \n\nSome blame America's campaign finance system, asserting that unrestricted donations from individuals and corporations corrupts the system and makes legislators beholden to their donors and backers rather than to their constituents. Some assert that the aforementioned problems are compounded by issues in the political economy: neoliberal economic policies that allowed the rich to take a higher share of national income and wealth enabled them to game the political system in their favor. \n\nMoreover, many political scientists look at how governance is affected by both actors and institutions. The institutional design of the U.S. federal government necessities compromise; however, when the political parties are unwilling to work together (as is the case now), the gears of government grind to a halt. As per the conditional party government theory, when the parties are internally homogeneous and polarized, efficiency increases in the House due to positive and negative gate-keeping by the Speaker, but efficiency is worsened in the Senate due to the filibuster (unless one party has 60+ members). As a result, during periods of divided government, little gets done. Furthermore, the constitutional design of the U.S. and the system of federalism could lead to political dysfunction. \n\nWhile all of these are arguably problems (depending on your viewpoint), I feel that above all else, the main problem is a dangerously ill-informed populace. Most voters don't have any meaningful knowledge of American history, world history, political theory (knowing about the principles upon which America is based), economics, business, science, sociology, foreign policy, etc. I'm not saying that it's practical or expected for people to become experts in all of these fields, but they need some basic knowledge so that they can think for themselves to some degree. \n\nMoreover, people don't spend enough time critically thinking about the various issues in politics (both issues that affect them personally and issues that affect America at large), and don't adequately analyze the positions of the candidates. \n\nFurthermore, people are so ill-informed that they fail to even apply basic mathematics to real world issues. As a result, they fall for all sorts of hilariously misguided policies, and mathematically impossible schemes.\n\nThere's a concept in politics called 10 words-- which is, if you can't simplify a policy issue in 10 words or less, your audience won't get it. Most issues are extremely complex, involving multiple sides all with gains and losses, and the majority of the audience are extremely incapable of truly grasping them. \n\nVoters often use heuristics to determine their vote; as a result, the are easily manipulated by pundits whom voters believe to knowledgeable. Because of low information voters, politicians have an incentive to pander the lowest common denominator, and to appeal to people's fears and emotions. Consequently, voters don't choose the best candidate. They chooses the candidate who promises the most and best things (regardless of whether the candidate can actually get these things done), and uses flashy vacuous feel-good psuedo-inspirational political rhetoric (compare this to Britain where candidates focus more on concrete policy and use facts and figures in their debates).\n\nPoliticians focus more on rhetoric appealing to pathos rather than formulating concrete policy to the nation's problems. Since people are so vulnerable to manipulation, politicians can convince voters to vote against their interests, and make them genuinely believe lies including the belief that man-made climate change isn't a real thing, and that cutting taxes on the very wealthy (aka job creators) will trickle down to the poorest worker. \n\nThe reason why politicians care more about serving special interests is because politicians would rather impose diffuse costs on voters at large while providing specific benefits to politically engaged special interest groups  RATHER than providing diffuse benefits to voters (a politically disengaged group) and providing specific costs to special interests. After all, politicians can later delude their constituents into thinking that their evisceration of energy efficiency standards actually helps voters by \"creating more jobs\" or something. \n\nPeople often blame SuperPACS and the Koch brothers, etc, for rigging the electoral system. But ultimately, what they are doing is airing ads, sending leaflets, disseminating their views on the internet, doing marketing campaigns, etc. It's not as if the Koch brothers are literally forcing the viewers of their ads to vote for particular candidates. Voters still do have the final say in whom they vote for.\n\nIf people became more genuinely educated and aware about these issues, they would be able to think for themselves, and would be better able to critique the positions of political candidates and resist the propaganda spewed by pundits and candidates (and their campaigns). If people actually exercised their voting right in a meaningful manner, politicians would be less beholden to special interests and would have an incentive to pursue policies actually in line with the genuine views of their constituents. Moreover, voters would pick higher quality candidates who instead of focusing all their time trying to fundraise from special interests and deluding voters, would focus on legislating policy to deal with America's genuine issues (climate change, education, etc). \n\n\nResponse A Author: Izzysofizzy\n\nResponse A: I think you are on the right track, however, you have failed to highlight the source of the problem. An ill-informed populace is only a symptom of the disease--a poor education system. While America still ranks fairly high globally for education &amp; developed many of the educational methods used in other countries, they often don't apply here. Inadequate pay for teachers and issues with school funding being assigned by property tax mean that schools aren't often great, duly, many low-income people will not receive a good education or foundation for logic. Later down the line, they don't have as much knowledge regarding child rearing (for ex: reading to a child will help them learn good vocabulary and more) that will ultimately perpetuate this cycle unless the educational system improves. \n\nBecoming educated on issues is not as easy as you think--while for you and I (who clearly have enough free time to browse reddit, access to internet, a computer, and reading/typing skills) browsing \"alternative\" news sources may be a clear option, a great majority of people only receive their news from Fox, CNN, and other media outlets that only present a narrow view. These mainstream news sources often only present the narrow Republican vs. Democrat view, instead of recognizing that perhaps both parties are wrong and stuck catering to corporate interests. Even more people never think on their own -- seriously, 83% of Americans do not spend any part of their day thinking. It's fairly difficult to sit back and muse upon the merits of various social programs when you are concerned with making ends meet or supporting a family. For most people, thoughts and worries are always running in their head &amp; they don't want to think about the world's issues -- just survive the day. Like you, I find it very hard to believe that anyone could not be concerned  with the major issues of our time &amp; not set out to find the truth on their own, but many don't have the educational backing, free time, or mental bandwidth.\n\nI encourage you to approach this issue from a compassionate standpoint &amp; try and sympathize with those who did not receive a strong educational foundation. Meanwhile, focus on correcting the issue if it bothers you so much--spread awareness and advocate for news sources that provide educational awareness on issues (think websites like Vox). On a final note, consider the dramatically different backgrounds most people in America come from. How can we possibly expect someone from a religious small town in Kansas to agree with an individual raised in a big Eastern city? It's frankly quite shocking that we are able to come to some medium of consensus given America's disparate population composition.\n\nResponse B Author: depricatedzero\n\nResponse B: I think it's not that the populace is ill-informed, it's that they're apathetic. This is true on a wide range of topics. The majority of Americans buy into what the Media sells, which is two major points: \"Toe the party line\" and \"Don't bother.\" The first is sold by news outlets, the other by the entertainment industry.\n\nIf you don't agree with every last word Bill O'Reilly says, you're a freedom hating left-wing french atheist chinese muslim. If you oppose unreasonable gun control you're a right-wing frothing redneck xenohomotechnophobe. Fuck me for having my own thoughts, right?\n\nSo the other side of the media distracts from the politics with \"news\" about murderers and feeds people their opinions as facts (looking at you HLN), or provides vapid role models like Snooker or the bearded duck people - who all convey the idea that politics is for politicians.\n\nPeople are taught not to think for themselves, not to be interested in the world at large. I had this exchange with an ex recently:\n\n\n\n\n\naside: Samsung has since rehired said supplier, so I'm now on the fence about them. But that was after this discussion.\n\n\n\n\n[MFW](http://vkunimelb.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/wut.gif)\n\nThat's just an example of what I mean. Elsewhere, being politically minded is considered \"being an asshole.\" For instance, I don't buy from Chic-Fil-A, Hobby Lobby, Papa Johns, Apple, Sony, Coke, and a number of other merchants because of their antics - everything from plain old oppression to instigating and profiteering from war. But when I say, \"lets order LaRosas instead of Papa Johns\" suddenly I'm an asshole because I don't want to support someone who pisses on his employees. When I veto Chic-Fil-A, I'm an asshole because I don't want to give money to groups that will use it to oppress my gay friends. When I say that the people at Apple are monsters because they condone child labor, I'm a bastard for being judgmental.\n\nBut I'm ok with that branding. Because I know that I'm not at fault for what Chic-Fil-A does - I don't have a hand in their shenanigans. Likewise, I participate in every vote - as everyone should. I read up on issues I don't understand and review each candidate against my ethics. Those who pass get my vote.\n\nBut it's not stupidity, it's not being uneducated, ill-informed, or even misinformed. Though the public is also terribly misinformed - the same people who rage against Al-Qaeda are currently supporting them under the name \"Syrian Rebels.\"\n\nIt's because, for the most part, they're apathetic. They have no interest beyond themselves because they've never needed to and have not been given a good reason to have such interest. They're comforted by the illusory blanket that the US has never been invaded - what do they care about what's happening on the other side of the planet? And besides, they're not gay so why should they care about gay rights? I'm not a woman, why should I care about women's rights or male privilege or any of it?\n\nThat's why the advertising you mentioned works. Because it's not about misinformation even - it's just about exposure. Get your name out there, make it big and loud, and make big promises you'll break later because no one is going to follow up and check.\u00a0 Get the\u00a0churches to your side and their followers to vote on your ticket. You get as many people to your side as you can, pressure them into voting, and rely on the apathy of those who might be opposed to you, and the minority of those you intend to oppress.\n\nIt's not that they're ill-informed. They're just apathetic, and that's worse. :(Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author Izzysofizzy's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

[CMV]\n\nOp: I'm sure most reddit users have noticed this bias. It will probably hit your frontpage, no matter what you are subbed to.\n\nThe question is: when does this bias become *hate*. This, as I see it, is the only subjective part. So go ahead and try to change my view!\n\n\nSo it looks like I need to say more. Here are a few of my reasons:\n\n/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut has four times as many subscribers as /r/Good_Cop_Free_Donut *and* /r/ProtectAndServe combined.\n\nAfter searching \"cop\" using reddits search function. The second result is an /r/AskReddit thread about moronic cops.\n\nResponse A Author: cid994\n\nResponse A: No, Reddit doesn't hate the police. And this comes from someone who really knows the matter.\n\nI personally don't like police forces, and I know lots of people who hate cops even more than I do. And that's quite a lot. As far as I know, there are a number of categories that hate police:\n\n* Who hate cops because just got in trouble for something pretty trivial, for example a ticket. Those don't really hate cops, they only go around saying \"**That** cop was a real idiot. He gave me a ticket!\"\n\n* Who hate cops because got in trouble for something serious, for example a robbery. If they spent time in prison, those people are even more likely to express this kind of hate: \"Cops are only pigs, they framed me! I did almost nothing!\"\n\n* Who hate cops because of the social group they are in, to fulfill what's usually seen as a stereotype and conform to the social norm. An example in America nowadays are all those wannabe *gansta* young people.\n\n* Who hare police because of political and philosophical causes. For example: anarchists, communists, some socialists...\n\nMost of Reddit is made up of white, quite sheltered and very moderate, yet progressive, guys in their twenties. This category doesn't really match up with my examples, so I think it's kinda far-fetched saying that Reddit *hates* police and cops.\n\nSome people, a minority, hates or at least dislikes police and police officers. But, considering the anonymity policy we have here, those numbers are likely inflated.\n\nReddit dislikes bad cops and likes simple example of justice it can relate to, but sometimes people target cops in general because people **need** to talk shit about who's in charge. Just like teenagers who won't stop talking about how shitty their parents are.\n\n------\n\nOn an unrelated note, ACAB.

If you could find a number of posts where redditors are hating on good cops that say stuff as in \"This cop turned in his superior for abuse of power and risked his career in standing up for justice...man I hate that guy so much...\"  Then I would believe you.\n\nAs it is, I have not seen even one single example of even a single redditor in any single post globally hating on cops in general.

(NB: I myself am a meat-eater)\n\nOp: Despite having eaten meat from birth, I find it hard to defend my diet.\n1. I believe there are perfectly good alternatives to eating meat (if one can afford it), such as pulses, beans etc and that therefore it is unnecessary to kill animals for protein, no doubt something that cause considerable distress to them. (note that they may have to live in dodgy conditions as well as being slaughtered).\n2. It would also be good for the environment as I believe animal rearing contributes hugely to global warming, perhaps justifying a meat free life. Equally it would free up huge amounts of crops that could feed needy people (?) or assorted others. \n\nFinal note: As a human being I believe I have a moral responsibility to try and prevent suffering as I have freedom of choice, What differentiates me and a bear is free will to make moral decisions which a bear is incapable of understanding. Therefore I should try and be a veggie. That said maybe I should sell my house and live as a hermit, donating my earnings to the poor; ultimately however, I am selfish and unwilling to do this although perhaps I should. Anyway that is probably a different argument.\n\n\n \n\n\nResponse A Author: insaneHoshi\n\nResponse A: Well for one, dont say its morally indefensible, since all top level posters here are morally defending it.\n\n\nDo we really?  Our minds are products of instinct and upbringing.  Hell our free will might not even be that free.  Brain studies have shown that a person makes a choice, before they are conscious of that decision.  Taking that into account, how is our \"choice\" any different from a bears?\n\nAlso bears are a very poor example, who knows somewhere out there there could be a bear that only eats berries.\n\n\nFor one, thats not really how morals work. You cant go out and say, its a universal moral to prevent suffering, hell you cant go out and say universal morals exist.  If universal morals don't exist where do they come from? Certainly not a user on r/CMV\n\nSecond there are probably a lot of acts that you do or do not do that cause suffering, why the suffering caused by you, more morally right than someone who eats meat?\n\nIf you meant you are morally right because you try to cause less suffering by not eating meat, than again there are probably a lot of acts that you do not do that cause suffering.  How is that morally gooder than someone raising a pig off their food scraps?\n\n\nResponse B Author: excultist\n\nResponse B: Life in the wild is generally a struggle of some kind.  Animals have to search or hunt for food and there is no guarantee that they will find enough of it.  Animals fight with members of their own species over scarce resources, and also have to fear predators.  Animals get sick for many different reasons (there are just as many reasons for animals to get sick as there are for people to get sick) yet there is no medical care available.  No one ever sets their broken bones or fills their dental cavities.  In bad weather they may have no shelter.  It's really not an easy life.  Domesticated animals often have a much easier life than wild animals, even if they are intended eventually to be eaten by people.  People take care of their animals.  Now of course, when it comes to food animals, there is a lot of factory farming in which animals live in terrible conditions, but that does not *have* to be the case.  Animals can also be raised for food in a more considerate manner, in good conditions.  Rather than arguing for an end to eating meat, I would simply argue for treating animals better when we raise them to be eaten.Which response is more successful in persuading the op?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author insaneHoshi's response is successful in persudaing the op in my analysis."}]}

CMV.\n\nOp: I have seen numerous posts lately along the lines of \"I don't like bacon, CMV\" or \"XYZ musical act is not good at music, CMV\".  These posts are based on personal taste, and there is no logical argument that could make the poster change their taste.  These posts seem to be more of a statement, rather than a call to change their view.\n\nThe obvious rebuttal to this would be how do we define a removable post, since there would be some grey area.\n\nResponse A Author: canti28\n\nResponse A: Food is one thing, but you absolutely can change someone's view regarding their musical taste. I'm not capable of it personally, because I don't know all that much about music, but why do you think there are so many music review sites? Why are there so many blogs devoted to critiquing and understanding music? There are people who have spent their entire lives critiquing music. Music reviews, reviews of any kind, are arguments for the worth, or lack thereof, of a piece of art.\n\nFor instance, a long time ago, I could not get My Bloody Valentine's *Isn't Anything*. I tried, but it just never clicked for me, and because of that, I didn't bother with the rest of their discography. But, I started reading reviews and analysis of their work, and it forced me to give them another try. I listened to *Loveless* and fell in love with the band, and I went back and listened to *Isn't Anything*, and it clicked for me, because this time I knew what to look for from the band.\n\nHaving said that, this isn't a great subreddit for discussing specific music. I have seen some really great discussions about genres of music, but not for specific works so far as I can remember. Probably because this is a very general subreddit, and music appreciation is a very specialized thing. So, musical tastes *are* disputable, though I would recommend going elsewhere if you want to discuss it. \n\n/r/letstalkmusic is great.\n\nResponse B Author: BallsDeepInLife\n\nResponse B: Well saying CMV is exactly that. Changing a view not a fact. A view is a different angle at seeing something. Whether they be proclaiming a band \"sucks\" or they don't like walking. It's a way of seeing it.

I think it's ok to take the stance that playboy, porn and other forms of \"exposing art\" are wrong, but if you are a subscriber or you consume this form of media you should not have the moral stance to say to your daughter; family member, etc, should not expose themselves in this form of media. I see it like if I was a massive meat eater and my daughter was a vegetarian, then one day she wanted to eat meat. I might not encourage her to do it for various of my beliefs, but because I eat meat I cannot oppose her choice as long as she is an adult. It seems extremely hypocritical IMHO since every single girl in those pornos and playboys are still someone's daughter and if you enjoy looking at them naked you should not be able to oppose someone like your daughter from doing them. Personally I am a consumer of porn, not gonna deny that much; and although I do not have a daughter at the moment, I would not encourage my daughter to do porn, but if she was an adult and made that choice, while I might not be fully comfortable with it, I should not be able to take a moral stance against it since I am a consumer. I am not interested in hearing explanations like \u201conce you have a daughter you\u2019ll understand\u201d or \u201c imagine raising a kid and then seeing them one day having sex with 2 guys at once in front of the world\u201d since once again, I do consume this form of media and every single one of those girls is \u201csomeones kid\u201d and if I really had a problem with it I would not watch it to begin with.\n\n\n\nResponse A Author: OakTable\n\nResponse A: Your title is \"If you are not comfortable having your daughter doing porn you should not watch it.\" but your argument is \"If you enjoy watching porn, you should not object to your daughter being involved in it.\" Which is it?\n\n\"I am uncomfortable with the thought of my daughter doing porn. Therefore, upon reflection, I realize that it would be wrong for me to watch/continue to watch porn.\" is a completely different track than, \"I am uncomfortable with the thought of my daughter doing porn. But because I enjoy watching porn, I feel it would be hypocritical of me to object to my daughter being involved in porn. Therefore, upon reflection, to avoid being a hypocrite I will let my own flesh and blood take work in what I consider a harmful profession for someone to be involved in.\"\n\nI won't argue against the first point, but I will argue against the second.\n\nLet's say you're broke, and steal $20 from some guy on the street. You think it's wrong. Now you're broke again, and your daughter is walking by. You know you could steal $20 from her if you tried it, but decide not to because she's your daughter.\n\nIf it's \"hypocritical\" for someone to put their children's wellbeing above the wellbeing of a stranger by refraining from harming one's own child... well, you could make the argument that it's wrong to harm strangers, but I don't see how you can reasonably argue that it's wrong to not also let your children come to harm. I feel the term \"hypocrite\" is being used to induce false guilt in a lot of situations, to say that doing one objectionable thing means one must also do some other objectionable thing to \"be consistent,\" or that being inconsistent is a worse crime than otherwise performing fewer actions which one might consider wrong.\n\nResponse B Author: CMarlowe\n\nResponse B: Firstly, I don\u2019t think we should lump Playboy and hardcore porn into the same heap. I grew up when Playboy was still a culturally relevant phenomena and I still enjoy it. I dislike a lot of hardcore porn because I do find it demeaning and exploitative toward women, and I\u2019m not father. \n\nI don\u2019t think what you proposed is necessarily a good litmus test, though. I wouldn\u2019t personally work at a slaughterhouse, but I eat meat. I wouldn\u2019t want my child to be a sanitation worker yet I recognize the value of that work. I don\u2019t think being the beneficiary of a certain group\u2019s labor means you also must aspire for the same for your child.  \n\nI think the case can be made that you\u2019re acting hypocritically if you believe pornography or participation in constitutes a moral evil and still consume it.

Unaltered cats have a hormonal urge to roam in search of mates. When your tom gets the urge, he will do his damndest to bolt out the front door and into oncoming traffic. At best, your cat will impregnate another cat and create litters and litters of unwanted kittens. At worst, your cat will die because he was hit by a car. At even worse than that, your cat will get hit by a car, and not quite die, but cost you either hundreds of dollars to be put down, or thousands of dollars of surgery.\n2. Unaltered toms spray. Your cat hasn't discovered the couch yet, but eventually he will, and his piss will cause an eye-watering stench in your home. It's fucking gross, dude.\n3. Unaltered toms also have an increased risk of kidney disease. When cats have kidney problems, they become averse to the litter box, and start peeing all over the house. Sometimes, that urine is also bloody. Oh yeah, and kidney disease can kill your cat.\n4. Millions of cats are put down every year. Letting your cat breed freely only contributes dozens of more cats every year to this death pool. Neuter one cat, prevent hundreds of cats from being killed during the course of one lifetime.\n5. Neutered toms need fewer calories in their diet. You actually save money on pet food in the long run by neutering him.\n6. Cats, as much as I love them, are a disaster for birds. Hawaii used to be a paradise of birds. Then settlers brought rats and cats with them. Now a lot of native bird species are extinct or critically endangered. That's an extreme example, but studies estimate that cats kill billions of birds in the US every year https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-kill-more-one-billion-birds-each-year\n\nRESOURCES     \nfrom BestFriends.org http://bestfriends.org/What-we-do/Our-Work/Spay---Neuter/     \nfrom ASPCA http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/spay-neuter\n\nobligatory [cat picture](http://i.imgur.com/RMS8ASx.jpg).\n\nResponse B Author: [deleted]\n\nResponse B: Consider this - if you are too poor to get him fixed, then you are most likely too poor to have a cat. I didn't understand this when I first got a cat, thinking - how expensive could they possibly be? But, years later and I have spent thousands of dollars on my cats. Obviously I'm not talking about the food &amp; litter (which does add up) but the vet bills. Male cats are extremely prone to developing crystals in their urinary tract which can block them from peeing. This can cause severe kidney damage and even death. A few months ago we had to take our cat to the ER vet, he had 2 catheters and had to have emergency surgery. This cost over $2000. If the main reason why you are avoiding the neutering is because of money, you may want to reevaluate having a cat all together. Yes, you love it and are providing it with a good home. But if you can't take proper care of it - is it really the best place for the cat?
