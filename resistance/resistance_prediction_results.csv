CMV: We shouldn't eat salted peanuts; they're inferior to unsalted peanuts,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,"The author's assertion is based on a subjective preference, which inherently makes the statement malleable. The author presents both objective and subjective premises in a valid structure, leading to an unfalse statement. The reason that makes the statement false is that the author specifically claims salted peanuts have inferior taste compared to unsalted ones, creating a premise that can be debated.","The author holds a logical perspective that eating unsalted peanuts allows for a more pronounced peanut flavor. This is objectively true, as the salt does alter the basic taste profile. The author conflates taste with health considerations, which makes the argument both subjective (taste preference) and somewhat objective (health risks). This duality may lead to misunderstandings. While health messages are influential, many people continue to consume salted foods for enjoyment, which tends to override factual arguments related to health and preference. The author's perspective is highly subjective, as taste is inherently personal. Those who prefer salted peanuts may find it hard to be swayed in their preference.","final fallback, no explanation"
CMV: I think Insurance companies should be able to disqualify people for pre-existing conditions.,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The author is based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of the role of businesses in society. They view insurance companies as entities that can't morally justify providing insurance for those at greater risk, which overlooks the social responsibility aspect that societal healthcare programs aim to provide. The author does not consider the implications of widespread denial of coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions on the health disparities in society. Disqualifying individuals with pre-existing conditions can lead to significant long-term harm, including increased societal costs through emergency care. The author’s perspective is rooted in a rigid interpretation of capitalism, dismissing the possibility of a more humane balance between profit incentives and societal responsibility. This rigidity makes it difficult for them to accept more progressive views about insurance coverage. The author lacks an understanding of the ethical implications and the actual workings of the insurance industry, which can ultimately harm those with pre-existing conditions, failing to recognize that this can lead to unstable health crises and increased burdens on healthcare systems.","The author's reasoning is largely predicated on their understanding of capitalism, specifically that businesses operate solely for profit motives. They are referencing a rationale for excluding those with pre-existing conditions, reflecting the belief that businesses should not be burdened by such moral obligations. The author believes that insurance companies should make decisions based purely on financial viability without any ethical obligations imposed by legislation, indicating a strong belief in a free-market economy. The author's argument is centered on the perception that people's health is a personal responsibility that should not impact businesses, suggesting a deep-rooted belief system about individualism and personal accountability.","final fallback, no explanation"

The author raises concerns about public exposure to sexual content and relies on an interpretation of ‘false equality’—arguing that even if some degree of equality is achieved, the context around sexualization and decency remains complex. The argument reflects a misunderstanding of the objectives of the 'Free the Nipple' movement, confusing the movement's aim of bodily autonomy and expression rights with the idea of universally enforcing sexual exposure through 'equality'. The author posits that current public decency laws adequately protect societal norms and are collectively decided, indicating a resistance to changing the status quo without broader societal consensus.

The assertion typically comes from a place of ideological commitment rather than empirical evidence, making it more susceptible to counterarguments that address the systematic risks associated with mental illness in those roles. The author's characterization of the media portrayal of mental illness may downplay legitimate concerns regarding mental health and workplace performance safety in demanding fields.","The author seems to have an idealistic view of mental health rights, which may prevent them from being malleable.

The author adopts a collective societal perspective on justice, prioritizing an unbiased approach that does not align with the common sentiments expressed in revenge narratives.","The author may have an overly simplistic view of justice, conflating the concepts of revenge and justice, which leads them to erroneously believe that punishment must come from a place of ethical reasoning rather than emotional responses. They might be underestimating the complexity of human emotions involved in justice and punishment, particularly in the context of violent crime, where victims' families often express a desire for revenge.

Today, the music landscape is dominated by genres such as hip-hop and electronic, which shift the focus away from traditional rock, leading to a reconsideration of who qualifies as a 'rock star'. Definitional Ambiguity: The criteria for being considered a 'rock star' are subjective and can change with cultural trends. While Cobain is seen as a quintessential rock star by some, the criteria for being a rock star today may not align with those from the past.

The confusion arises from misinterpreting karma as a direct indicator of post quality. Many posts have low karma due to their nature as more opinion-based. This can lead to misunderstanding the function of downvotes, as not all opinions are qualified or validated by the community in a positive sense. The community evaluates the validity of the argument rather than mere disagreement. The context of use in r/changemyview doesn’t fully support the claim, as a lower karma score could also indicate that the post is unhelpful, poorly constructed, or not relevant to the community, rather than a mere disagreement. Users are often directed by the community to evaluate posts based on their content, leading to a more nuanced understanding of why posts might receive low or no karma, rather than viewing this metric solely through the lens of disagreement.","final fallback, no explanation"

Technological advancements will likely continue to facilitate music distribution, enabling songs to be released more promptly, which aligns with the author's claim.

CMV: Anger is largely an unhealthy investment of time and energy,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,"The malleability status of this author is: False. The author's assertion about anger being an unhealthy investment of time and energy is largely incorrect. Anger serves several purposes, such as motivating individuals to fight against injustice, signaling to others that one's boundaries have been crossed, and influencing societal change when expressed collectively. The perception of anger being purely negative disregards cultural and situational contexts where anger leads to positive actions, such as advocacy or reform movements that challenge unfair systems. Finally, the author's blanket statement fails to account for individual differences in the interpretation and expression of anger, meaning that while anger can lead to negative outcomes in some instances, it can also catalyze positive interactions, growth, and resilience in others.","The author recognizes that anger is a normal human emotion, which indicates an awareness of the emotional landscape. However, they seem to idealize the communication dynamics in relationships, potentially falsely assuming that anger's expression is always ineffective. While the author argues that anger clouds judgment and prevents constructive dialogue, this overlooks certain contexts where anger can motivate change or express necessary boundaries. The author's perspective appears somewhat rigid, as they generalize about the negativity of anger without acknowledging scenarios where anger can lead to positive outcomes. There may also be a misconception in assuming that the expression of anger never contributes positively to discussions and advocacy.","The author’s willingness to accept or reject new ideas is false. The assertion that anger is largely an unhealthy investment seems to create a black-and-white perspective on an emotion that is complex and multi-faceted.

False. The credibility status of this author is False.

The author's argument hinges on their interpretation of admin actions, suggesting that banning subreddits effectively censors the ideas discussed within them. The underlying belief that subreddits are mere topics rather than entities capable of rule violation makes the author's assertion malleable.","The author's premise is built on a misunderstanding of the nature of subreddit bans and moderation policies. While they assert that subreddits are merely topics of conversation, in practice, Reddit's policies aim to regulate community behavior and content. The idea of banning an entire subreddit does not equate to banning the topic; rather, it reflects a moderation effort against specific behaviors deemed harmful.

This misinterpretation can lead to misguided conclusions about what constitutes ban evasion. The author overlooks the role of moderation standards and community guidelines that explicitly define acceptable content and behavior, impacting the sustainability of a subreddit rather than the idea itself.

Many factors contribute to suicidal ideation, and categorizing the act as selfless overlooks the impact on loved ones. The author's argument attempts to reframe the perception of suicide victimhood in a self-centered manner. This perspective might relieve guilt from those contemplating suicide, but it may not offer a realistic view for those who are affected by the act. The complexity of mental health crises, including suicidal thoughts, means that the motivations behind such actions cannot be simplistically categorized as selfish or selfless. The author's framing of the issue does not provide room for dialogue or understanding; therefore, it may lead to oversimplification of a very complicated situation.","The author presents a subjective perspective regarding the motivations behind suicide, which means their viewpoint is interconnected with broader psychological and sociological interpretations. The argument presented claims that those who criticize suicide as selfish are actually the selfish ones, but this perspective can be challenged by varying interpretations of altruism and individual responsibility. The author's position hinges on a complex moral landscape involving interpretations of selfishness and selflessness, which are inherently subjective.

CMV: Population decline is a good thing.,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"The author expresses a belief that population decline is beneficial, indicating they have a preconceived and strongly held belief. The argument presented is primarily centered on an interpretation of future economic conditions, implying that the author feels they possess insights or knowledge that informs their stance. The author's perspective involves complex socio-economic variables, making it less likely to be swayed by persuasive arguments.","The author's belief in population decline being a good thing may stem from a perspective that values sustainability and the reduction of resource strain, particularly in a context of advancing automation and changing economic structures. The author's stance appears to rely on the assumption that a decrease in population will lead to a more sustainable society, which could be challenged by evidence or arguments regarding economic viability, labor shortages, and societal structure. The author may be overlooking potential negative consequences of population decline, such as labor shortages, fiscal challenges (e.g., pensions), or potential cultural stagnation, leading to the malleability status. On the other hand, their perspective may be bolstered by beliefs about automation removing jobs, indicating they might believe economic growth as traditionally defined is not essential or even counterproductive.",The openness status of this author is: False.

CMV: Closed-book examinations are superior to open-book examinations as a means of demonstrating knowledge,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The author's belief is based on the conceptual understanding of knowledge demonstration as a performance measure. This foundational perspective limits the author's ability to be swayed. The author places value on traditional methods of evaluation, which often resist change regardless of the merits of alternative methods. The reasoning is focused on a philosophical stance regarding assessment types; such beliefs are inherently subjective and less susceptible to empirical proof. The typical perception of knowledge assessment in educational contexts often supports the author's perspective, reinforcing their belief system.","The author has expressed a strong belief in the superiority of closed-book exams, which indicates a deeply held conviction. These types of beliefs are typically resilient to change. The rationale provided by the author emphasizes the internalization of knowledge over mere access to information, which suggests that their view is likely rooted in educational philosophy rather than empirical evidence. This belief may also be reinforced by anecdotal experiences that favor closed-book assessments, adding to its resilience.",The openness status of this author is: False. False.

CMV: I think women should not have combat roles in the military,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,"The author has a rigid belief system, viewing military roles solely through a lens of efficiency and gender roles. The author has definitively closed the door to arguments framed around fairness or equality, indicating that these points will not alter their views. The author possesses a traditional view of gender roles that is deeply embedded, making it less susceptible to change under current societal discussions.","The author relies heavily on perceived biological differences between men and women, which is a standpoint often influenced by societal norms rather than scientific evidence. The author's reasoning seems to dismiss considerations of individual capability over gender-based restrictions, which can be flawed. The author's views may be shaped by their interpretation of military effectiveness, overlooking the potential benefits of gender diversity. Cultural expectations and traditional views of masculinity and femininity strongly influence the author's beliefs. The author has expressed a deep-seated perspective that is unlikely to change due to the reasoning employed.","final fallback, no explanation"
CMV: I use iTunes. Why should I switch to something like Spotify when I already have an extensive library set up?,True,True,False,True,True,False,False,"Flexibility and adaptability: The author may be flexible in terms of their music consumption habits and might be open to exploring new platforms if they see compelling reasons to do so. Financial considerations: If the author perceives Spotify's subscription model as beneficial—especially if they want to access collaborative playlists, music recommendations based on listening habits, or an extensive library without having to manage local files—this could incentivize switching. Community Influence: The influence of social circles plays a role; if more friends and peers use Spotify and can share playlists or collaborative features, the author's choice might sway them to switch as well. Awareness of platform benefits: If the author becomes aware of unique features Spotify offers that align with their music habits, like personalized playlists or social sharing options, they might be persuaded to transition.","The author is deeply satisfied with their current music library and the way iTunes integrates with their Apple devices, creating a strong sense of contentment. The author seems resistant to change, showing a preference for familiarity and a large existing library over potential digital expansion. The author's entertainment habits indicate they are not actively seeking new music, which makes subscription-based services less appealing. The perception of iTunes being 'free' adds a financial motivation for the author to remain with iTunes, reducing the likelihood of switching.","final fallback, no explanation"
CMV: Vegetarianism is senseless and is actually equal to being against humans,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The argument presented is an extreme position that lacks acknowledgment of ethical frameworks and the complexity of individual dietary choices. Its reasoning relies heavily on an economic perspective and disregards the varied motivations for vegetarianism. The author overlooks the benefits of vegetarianism in terms of environmental sustainability and health, which counter the claim of it being 'senseless'. The statement is often met with counterarguments that highlight the nuances of ethical consumption.","The argument presented by the author is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that vegetarianism directly harms human welfare by diverting funds from more ethical uses. The statement ignores the potential benefits of vegetarianism in terms of ecological sustainability and health benefits, which may result in overall societal improvements. The reliance on animal-based agriculture heavily impacts the environment and human health, which can be better addressed through plant-based diets. Cultural, ethical, and personal choices regarding diets can have complex factors that can't be easily dismissed.",The malleability status of this author is: False. False
CMV: You should know how to do simple car maintenance in order to be issued a driver's license.,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"The author already holds a strong belief regarding car maintenance knowledge as a prerequisite for driving eligibility, which is inherently a challenging stance to shift. The author anticipates that their reasoning will lead to agreement, creating a psychological environment where they will resist counterarguments. The author's perspective is shaped by their own experiences and interpretations; hence, they are less susceptible to changes in belief. The author has not provided a false premise that could be disputed, allowing them to construct responses that reinforce their original view.","It's not practical to require every driver to know how to do simple maintenance to obtain a license, as it would complicate the licensing process. Many drivers have other forms of support for emergencies, such as roadside assistance, which diminishes the necessity for such skills. In modern vehicles, technology is often used to alert drivers when maintenance is needed, suggesting a changing landscape in vehicle ownership and knowledge requirements.",The openness to new ideas of this author is False.

"CMV: a significant % of non-voters do not vote because they do not have confidence in any party. Countries should have a 'no confidence' vote in elections if they want to increase turnout, while achieving a better understanding of the public's perception of the political climate.",True,True,True,True,False,False,False,"The author expresses a strong belief in the concept of a 'no confidence' vote, indicating they are profoundly committed to their perspective. This inclination makes them resistant to contrary viewpoints. The belief in the effectiveness of a 'no confidence' vote as a means to increase turnout and 'measure public perception' further entrenches their position. The author appears to have confidence in their hypothesis and articulates it in a detailed manner, indicating that they have not considered alternative points of view or evidence disputes to their claims.","The author is driven by a clear desire for increased voter turnout and engagement, reflecting an idealistic change in the electoral process. The author believes that the introduction of a 'no confidence' vote would validly represent the sentiments of non-voters and could catalyze the required electoral atmosphere. The author may be overly optimistic regarding the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a 'no confidence' ballot in political systems. The author's perspective on the current electoral systems lacks empirical grounding, as it assumes all non-voters would partake in a 'no confidence' vote if it existed.

The premise suggests that the author may hold a nuanced view on morality that takes consumption habits into account, leaving room for the potential influence of moral reasoning. The author's lack of outright outrage about the lion hunting suggests that they are already somewhat desensitized to such issues, indicating that their opinion may shift slightly in response to new perspectives, as it's not a deeply held conviction.","The author exhibits a mixed stance on the issue, indicating a nuanced perspective on animal rights and consumption. Their claim relies on a specific interpretation of moral consistency regarding animal rights. The author's position is false since they maintain a balanced view on the morality of their own dietary choices, recognizing that their consumption habits impact animals.
