Perhaps tacking on a tax stamp like current NFA items require, license to possess, require approval from a CLEO, and requiring registration/tight tracking (annual report on whether the gun is still in your possession or not, who owns it, proof of transfer, etc. Much like a C&amp;R). Possession (but not immediately temporary transfer, e.g. letting someone else at the range shoot it) of such guns should require a license, but it should be available to the average non-criminal.\n\nOn the suppressors, they're already an item that only appeals to collectors/enthusiasts. Commercial ones run in the $800-$1000 range, and that's not even the top. Their price alone would help keep them out of the hands of the average violent criminal. There's absolutely no need for a person who's never so much as received a speeding ticket to have to pay a government agency for a private product that keeps him from losing his hearing while hunting.\n\nThese regulations being in place only affect the citizens that follow them. If a criminal has a real desire for a full auto gun or a suppressor, they can make one easily as it is or get around it. Plans for a DIY suppressor are readily available on the internet, and a trigger switch (basically a rotating lever that hits the trigger) can dump a magazine in seconds.\n\nSince Reddit is largely anti-gun, I'll analogize it:\n\nImagine dogs were regulated. Back in the 30s, there was a big problem with mobsters and their attack dogs (German shepherds, pit bulls, etc.). So the government introduced legislation banning them from citizens. This didn't do anything to lower the crime though - crime actually rose after this legislation. Through the decades, more dog control legislation was passed, but none of it ever had a positive impact on homicide rates. In fact, they usually rose after more dog control was passed. Now in the 80s, they decided to ban any new attack dogs from being bred, and regulated their ownership to the point where only people who were in the gun business and had access to thousands of dollars could obtain one.\n \nSure, there's no *need* for an attack dog, but why should they be illegal in the first place? Dogs aren't inherently bad, it's the owners. *I* can safely control my dog, so why should I be punished for the actions of the reckless few? Dog control has never done any good in the U.S., the dog collector/enthusiast community are some of the most responsible owners, dogs aren't even a major cause of homicides, and crime as a whole has been on a steady decline since the late 80s.\n\n It's for the children, of course. The benefit of pleasing a small group of collectors doesn't outweigh the risk of even one person being killed by an attack dog.\n\nAuthor: t3_2t4ji9\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

CMV\n\nComment: *Disclaimer: Because (excluding cross-overs) that's the only fandom i've read fanfics from, this post will include mentions of My Little Pony and the brony fandom. If references to these things give you rabies-like symptoms, allow me to redirect you [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bgzce/i_think_bronies_are_ridiculous_cmv/c96mpbo) or [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview).*\n\nI think the title sums my position up pretty well. Fan fiction is often looked down upon as being somehow inferior to \"original\" works. Even the word \"fan fiction\" has a bad connotation. I, however, believe that fan fiction is just as valuable as any original work and that often good stories are dismissed/ignored because they are \"merely fan fiction\".\n\nNow, to save some time, i will give some arguments against fan fiction that i can think of and will explain why i don't think they are valid:\n\n**Fanfic's have poor quality.**\n\nI'll admit there's a lot of bad fanfic, but i would like to remind people that there also a lot of truly horrible original works. Remember [Sturgeon's law](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StUrgeOnSlaw) (tvtropes link, so beware): \"90% of everything is crud.\"\n\nBasically, there are a lot of shitty fanfic's, but i know for a fact that there are also a lot of great fanfic's. Those that agree with me here can skip the bulletin points. For those that won't believe me i have some example's:\n\n* [Vinyl and Octavia: University Days](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/13477/vinyl-and-octavia-university-days): O god it's a ship fic, right? I mean it even has an [explicit extra chapter](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/47227/university-nights). This has got to be horrible right? Well, no. It's actually a beautifull story about the problems that same-sex couples face and about the importance of becoming independent from your parents.\n* [Fallout: Equestria](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190/fallout-equestria): It's a cross-over. Don't you hate those? Stealing from one work wasn't enough, this person had to steal from multiple works! Well actually, it's an epic story about an idealistic protagonist facing evil in a world that has stopped caring a long time ago and then has to face the consequences. It also does a good job of playing the good-ol' heart strings.\n* [My Little Dashie](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1888/my-little-dashie): Ok, at least a self-insert fanfic is by definition bad, right? Nope, it's just a very sad story about losing a person you care very much about.\n\nBut even if for whatever reason by percentage there are more bad fanfic's than bad original works: *et alors*? That still doesn't justify considering all fanfics to be bad. Most rational people don't think all black people are criminals just because they're statistically more likely to end up in prison.\n\n**Fanfic's are detrimental for the original work/author.**\n\nI really don't see how this is supposed to work. I can't see how fan fiction would hurt the author of the original work. I don't think anyone would ever think \"*Well, i've read this fanfic, so now i no longer have a reason to read/watch/look at the original work.*\" If anything, i image fanfic's have the opposite effect: They serve as free advertising for the original work. For example: I started watching MLP after reading [Better Living Through Science and Ponies](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22535/better-living-through-science-and-ponies).\n\nI can't see how it would be detrimental to the original work either. My enjoyment of MLP isn't lessened because [clopfic's](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=clopfic&amp;defid=5733129) (basically rule 34 for ponies) exist. I know they exist. I haven't read any. My life is generally not affected by their existence. You might say it's similar to the star wars prequels in that you think differently about the original because of the fanfic, but nobody forced to read that fanfic. It's not canon, so it was completely your own decision to read that fanfic. If you read a ship fic and now you can't ever look at those two characters the same way anymore, well then why did you read it?\n\n**Fanfic's are not original and therefore inferior by definition.**\n\nI just don't understand this argument at all. Fanfic's have original plots and often original setting and characters. What's the problem? No work is born out of a vacuum. [All works borrow from previous works](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/). The only difference is that fanfic's borrow more and that the borrowing is more obvious.\n\nSo that is my position.

It pains us as humans to admit it, but a machine that is a better general-purpose worker than all or nearly all people is a theoretical possibility, and after enough time, a certainty. \n\n2) Jobs will be automated out of existence so much faster than we can come up with new ones, due to the (surprisingly rapid) introduction of such technology.  This, barring structural changes to policy or our economy, will cause permanent, very high unemployment.\n\nI won't rehash all the news about automation, machine learning, and AI research speeding up and reaching important thresholds here, but I don't see any way around this. \n\nStated alternately, my view is this: \n\n1) Technology will become good enough to replace, rather than simply augment workers, in large numbers.  2) This will result in many people being unable to compete in the labor market.  There will be no market for many types of labor.  3) Many people won't be capable of performing any type of labor for which there is a market.  4) the market for labor is basically over at this point.  Meaning jobs. \n\nStated yet another way, in economic terms: technology will start to become a substitute for, rather than compliment for, labor.  This means falling long term average cost of labor - IMO this will proceed below any acceptable wage. \n\nFor reference, I believe this will all begin to happen quite noticeably within 30 years, and will be all but over in 70-80 years. \n\nCMV? \n\n\nAuthor: t3_216m8d\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

It gets its name from a hypothetical gun that MUST be fired (within a couple chapters, according to the original quote), if it's so much as hanging on a wall.\n\nI think this is a bad storytelling principle for two reasons.  First, it eliminates a lot of chances for actual immersion in the scene and the world.  More than just losing opportunities for exploring and describing the world, it creates a false sense that everything is \"connected,\" planned, which in itself breaks believability, or at least immersion.  The other reason can be illustrated by watching any episode of Law &amp; Order (SVU is especially guilty) where something \"minor\" happens out of the ordinary.  95% of the time when someone from a main character's past shows up, that person ends up being the guilty party.  An episode I just watched had a guy installing new phones being involved.  In a word, CG makes a narrative predictable, by its very nature.  Any detail can be relied upon to have special relevence if CG is in effect.  This doesn't make a story *necessarily completely* predictable, that's not my view.

You know that they will probably be charged, and you know the order of magnitude of punishment they will receive.\n\nTake a scenario where you knowingly wrongfully accuse someone of murder, and they get the death penalty as a result. I would say that you *murdered* this person and therefore should be exposed to the death penalty yourself in trial. \n\nThis seems to especially apply in cases of rape. While there are no doubt actual rapes that do occur. False accusations of rape have been used as a tool to destroy the lives of others going all the way back to the Jim Crow South, where black men were hung on frivolous rape accusations.\n\nThis tradition continues today with cases like the University of Virginia and (this is what I believe, and not the subject of this post) Bill Cosby. \n\nA person making a legitimate accusation has nothing to fear, but people would think twice before wrongfully accusing others.\n\nI have predicted the generic responses to my argument and will respond to them here.\n\n**Rightful accusers would have something to fear, if the person who victimized them gets away with their crime, they will now face prosection**\n\nThis is a good point, but I think that this can be solved by rethinking the way we choose juries. Jury selection in this country is effectively a rigged process, regardless of the location of the trial, the makeup of juries is almost always a homogeneous group of white suburbanites with predictable opinions. This makes it very difficult to convict criminal archetypes like the college rapist, or the malpracticing doctor. By introducing higher racial and socioeconomic diversity into juries, we can eliminate the predictability of verdicts.\n\n**The punishment is harsher than the crime.**\n\nNo it isn't. Killing someone is no different than setting a machine in motion that will result in them dying. Tricking the government into locking someone away for 40 years is surely a capital offense, and should be punished as such.\n\n**The perjury charge handles this**\n\nI believe that this is too weak, it is not a capital offense, and it should be.\n\nI am willing to change this view, but it will take some level of convincing.

Is it just me or is that just a stupid way of phrasing that ? Wouldn't \"Like you're clean ?\" be more natural, less stiff ?\n\nDc Comics: Red Hood: Starfire, just Starfire.

The way the writers make her wanting sex all the time just because \"fan service\" (she sees no difference between humans, she does not remember them, nor recolonize them ... but sex!!! God, they ruined the animated version of her T_T), that is horrible. Then the ret-con about her lying (she actually does remember them ... stupid).\n\nDc Comics: Teen Titans: The culling ... just horrible in of itself.\n\nAlso I have never seen a comic being smart, usually it's writers trying to be smart.

I have a good number of friends, I've dealt with some anxiety that used to drag me down and I'm much more confident in social situations. I'm passionate about a lot of different things - hobbies, consuming media, gaining more and more knowledge. I'm planning on going to university for a subject about which I'm very excited to learn, and although it'll be a lot of work, I'm expecting university to be a huge amount of fun as well - a whole new social life, a new setting, different activities, and most of all freedom.\n\nHowever, based on pretty much all descriptions of adulthood that I've read, things aren't very good after that. I've heard, many times, that people end up in office jobs that are mentally draining, and that whatever subject they were passionate about in school has become monotonous and dull. I know that many adults have a really hard time keeping up a social life, and trying to improve it is difficult. I've also read that as you age, your perception of passing time changes, and the years seem to slip by in an instant. I think that's one of the scariest things I've ever heard.\n\nRight now, I love so many things about my life, and I want to believe that as an adult, I'll be doing something I enjoy, and still doing the things that I enjoy now - having friends, writing music, reading great books and watching great movies. But based on what I've read, there's a chance I'm going to become this: a person who works all day at a job that's tiring, who comes home feeling exhausted every day, who does something during the evening that doesn't require much thinking - like watching TV - and who goes to sleep early in order to be a little less exhausted the next day. Someone who has some friends from university still, but doesn't see them very often - maybe once or twice a year - and otherwise doesn't do much socially. Someone who, although they might not notice, isn't really *doing* anything, and won't be for the rest of their life.\n\nI really don't want this to be true. I've met some adults who are amazing people, and whose lives seem interesting beyond anything I could want.

I believe that within the next ten years being able to declare bankruptcy on student loans will be \"on the table\" and shortly thereafter will become quickly restructured/irrelevant. Once it is on the table to begin with, compromises will become common between politicians unless the population with student debt lowers drastically and stays down. Otherwise, as an active political force and something at the forefront of many young people's minds (which will shape how they view the future), it will just whittle away at the enforcement structure of America's student debt until it becomes irrelevant.    \n\nIt probably won't be pretty, especially considering how people without degrees would feel about it, but it does look unavoidable due to sheer political force, especially as tuition rises. As someone who spent years as a mechanic, I find it incredibly doubtful that \"trade\" jobs could ever make up for the drop in the amount of actual jobs as technology replaces need.

But sometimes something slips through my precautions and the usual thoughts start streaming through my mind, such as 'whore, slut, attention whore, shameless, disrespectful, no dignity, disgusting person.' I think it's less about the actual person than my interpretation of the event. I was always taught that a persons body is private and not to be exposed for strangers or the world to stare at for a cheap visual thrill. But then again, I've been in art classes where we've had nude models. But it was tasteful and didn't have a sleazy feel to it. The model posed in ways to high light certain curves or angles. No inappropriate showing of genitals. I have no issue with breasts since they're for feeding babies. I have no sexual link to them. I know that people have every right to do what they want with their bodies, but I hold no pity for them when they get unwanted sexual attention. I don't feel ashamed of my own body, yet I have more respect for myself then to expose myself for the sake of others perversions. I realize there is much beauty in the human forms, all shapes and sizes hold their own unique beauty. But I think how it's presented is very important too.

I don't think you are doing anyone a favor by hanging in there out of commitment. I also don't think the potential other relationship is relevant - people often see it as some kind of \"punishment\" of the one who broke off the ltr for it if the new relationship doesn't work out. I however think that doesn't matter, point is that if you can fall in love with another, it says a lot about your relationship in the first place.\n\n\nI also think it is respectful to your partner to leave them. You are acknowledging they have the right to be committed to someone who loves them more than you, and you are also acknowledging they are fine enough to be on their own. Sure it may hurt - it is never nice to be dumped, especially for someone else. But the person leaving did nothing wrong and in fact did the most moral thing possible.\n\nI am also against blaming the one who leaves or seeing it as something horrible to break up if a relationship was long. No, you may have had a lot of good time, and it is fair to end it if feelings change. why would anyone owe you their life? No one can make a commitment that lasts forever, no matter how much people fool themselves that that is what marriage is. There is nothing evil or wrong in falling in love with another - cheating is wrong, being honest and leaving is fair and even brave when compared with attitudes most people have to just stick in the status quo while not feeling it. \n\n\nWhy would anyone want their partner to stay with them knowing they aren't in love with them anymore? Why would anyone want to be seen as a burden and duty? Relationship should be something it is always ok to walk out of - and then the few ones that stay together are doing so for honest reasons, not convenience. \n\n\nSome users (I awarded one delta at this point, but will read through and give more since few opinions/discussions helped me define this part) made me want to re shape my view. You don;t have to instantly leave your partner if you don't want to.

CMV\n\nComment: This tends to be an unpopular position, but here goes. For context purposes, I am come from an upper middle class white family.\n\nWhite people already have affirmative action. It's having parents and grandparents that had equal rights, which therefore gave them more of an ability to get good jobs themselves, and in turn give their children better opportunities. A lot of black people going to college these days are the first or second in their families to go to college at all for this very reason. That's why we have affirmative action. To make up for this HUGE advantage that white people already have. It's not just their parents and grandparents lacking the ability to have good jobs either, it's the lack of an ability to build connections (due to legal discrimination that existed not even 50 years ago) in the community that will help them later on, and in turn help their children.\n\nThere's also the fact that studies show everyone is implicitly racist whether they consciously know it or not. Some studies even show that babies prefer people of their own color, it's a completely natural thing. As of right now, minorities are very underrepresented in positions that hire people or accept college students. So the thought is that a white person on his own will, through no fault of his own, naturally be predisposed to pick a white person over a black person if they have the same credentials. This isn't just hypothetical. [There are studies confirming this.](http://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html) If you didn't click the link, it says that people with black sounding names have to send around 15 resumes to get 1 callback, compared with white sounding names that only have to send 10 resumes to get 1 callback. A white sounding name gets as many more callbacks as would an additional 8 years of experience. That means black people have to make up 8 freaking years just to get on the same level as white people. If that's not cause for affirmative action, then nothing is.\n\nYou're probably also misunderstanding what affirmative action actually is if you oppose it strongly. It's not a system where, for example, a certain number of minorities have to be picked for a college. That system is actually unconstitutional. It's really just giving some minorities possible plus points on their application or something like that. Never before has it been the stereotypical situation you hear from conservatives, where it comes down to one white student and one black student and the university is forced to pick the less qualified black student. That has never and will never happen. Seriously, if a university has it down to two students, they'll just let them both in, it's not like they have a strict number they are allowed to admit. Students are looked at on an individual basis, they aren't compared to others based on their ethnicity. It wouldn't happen. There also is affirmative action for socioeconomic status, which is why I assumed you didn't really understand affirmative action in the first place. Universities have many different factors they look at, socioeconomic status included. Minority status is just another one they may choose to look at if they so choose.\n\nTo sum up, I basically think that arguments against affirmative action are imagining a perfect world that we don't live in yet. They tend to say something like \"we shouldn't just look at someone's race, we should look at only their qualities!!\" but that's a gross oversimplification of the issue, and that argument only works in a world where people aren't judged by their minority status. But look at that resume study I posted. People are judged for their minority status before their qualities have even been mentioned, so we need a system that tries to eliminate this bias. And as I said in my first paragraph, white families have generations of wealth and social status that black families just don't have. In the future, I believe that affirmative action will someday not be necessary, when we get to a point where those disadvantages have disappeared. But for now affirmative action is a necessary stopgap measure. \n\nAuthor: t3_1ens5r\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

CMV.\n\nComment: I understand (or think I understand) the difference between sex and gender. As I understand it, sex is the physical, biological attribute (the genitals, secondary sex characteristics, etc.), while gender is a psychological and social phenomenon arising from the socialization inflicted on an individual as a result of the physical sex. (I.e., if you are born with a penis, you are treated in the way males are treated, and this shapes your psychology in a certain way.)\n\nAs such, it seems that gender is more or less an abstract construct; I don't see that the notion \"I'm of the male gender\" means anything besides \"I have been, as a result of my male sex, treated in a certain way since birth.\" This being the case, if I then announce that I am female, in what way is my assertion true? What I'm saying is that I'm of the female gender. But, again, the notion that \"I'm of the female gender\" can only mean \"I have been socialized as a female,\" which is patently untrue (and will be untrue for most every biological male except in extremely unusual circumstances).\n\nI can take a slightly different tack and suggest that I'm female because I feel more natural taking a stereotypically feminine role in society, e.g. I enjoy playing with Barbie dolls and am very emotionally sensitive, but this seems to be objectionable in a very obvious way; it's the same backward idea seen in \"go make me a sandwich\" jokes, i.e. that certain activities and characteristics are inherently appropriate for men or for women. As such, I don't think this is what's meant, and I doubt that people advocating for transgenderism would take this line of reasoning seriously.\n\nSo, again, in what way can my assertion that I'm female be true? Does it mean that I don't *like* being of the male gender, that I feel I'd be more comfortable if I had been raised as a female, even though I haven't? Well, not liking a state of affairs doesn't mean I can change it at will. Does it mean that I, in some way, see myself as being of the female gender? Well, then I'm simply *incorrect*, in the same way I would be incorrect if I \"saw\" Joe Biden as a purple walrus, because no identifiable characteristic of me is female.\n\nIt's as if, unhappy with the idea of myself as a white person, I suddenly decide to \"identify as\" a Chinese person. I'm not physically of Chinese descent, I haven't been raised as culturally Chinese, so in what way can I possibly claim to be Chinese?\n\nI do understand that there exists a neurological condition whereby individuals instinctively perceive their sex as being inappropriate for them. But not only do I doubt that the majority of people identifying as transgender have been diagnosed with this condition, it also doesn't at all account for the myriad other \"gender identities\" people sometimes use, such as \"genderqueer,\" \"genderfluid,\" \"agender,\" \"pangender,\" etc., etc., and I think a great many people would argue that claims of transgenderism carry water regardless of the presence of the neurological condition.\n\nWhile I don't think that there's anything inherently *morally* wrong about transgenderism, it does frustrate me to see the amount of dignification commonly given to what seems to me a very unsound idea.

Obviously being born with a penis or vagina does not make you a man or a woman and your gender is determined by what gender you feel that you are and what gender your brain is. Therefore if LeBron  identified as a woman then that would be an example of a woman who could compete (very well) in the NBA. \n\nHowever I do not believe this proves me wrong. For the purpose of this argument I think we should only look at completely objective (yes I know gender identity is objective) traits of physical prowess. \n\nI think that you would find that a majority of people would fall into two groups by their physical characteristics. These groups are typically called men and women and although that is very politically incorrect you all must recognize that there are physical differences in people are born especially in these two groups that I would imagine the majority of people fall into. \n\nPeople who have certain characteristics at birth can be objectively categorized. About half of them will naturally have characteristics like testosterone that lead to more overall body strength. This overall difference in strength when examined in the top elite athletes of either sex are quite apparent. \n\nIf you were to measure attributes that are considered athletic, such as how fast you can run, how high you can jump, how fast you can change direction, dexterity, amount of weight lifted ect. you would find that one group greatly outperforms the other and that the other group could not successfully compete with the other in certain athletic events. \n\nIf these two groups were both eligible to be drafted into professional sports, only members from one group would be drafted simply because their athletic abilities of even the bottom tier of professional players, would be greater than that of the top tier of players from the other group. \n\nI am of course forgetting about people who are inter sex (spelling?) so I really have no idea about the typical athletic abilities of those individuals. I am however saying that people who we would assign the sex female to, at birth, who have those traits that a vast majority of other individuals have, are not as strong and athletic and those born who we would assign the sex male to at birth, who also have characteristics that a vast majority of the population have.

For reasons other than flying around in space is cool(for the record, I do think flying around in space is cool).  The idea, I think, is that continued investment will one day allow us to colonize other planets, and if we don't work toward that immediately, it could be \"too late\" when we need it.\n\nI have a few problems with this.  First, if in fact mass colonizing planets outside of this galaxy will ever be possible, it will not be for many, many years.  Meanwhile, there are problem on *this* planet that are potentially imminent.  Existential risks like nuclear proliferation, climate change and engineered bioweapons will not politely wait while we spend decades or centuries coming up with a way to leave the galaxy.  Beyond catastrophic events like that, there is still untold human suffering in the form of poverty, famine, war, disease, oppression, slavery and any number of other cruelties that could potentially be helped by the investments we might spend on space programs.\n\nAnother argument that comes up is that development toward space programs can lead to innovations that are useful in other areas.  True enough, that has certainly happened before.  But is investing in space programs with the hope that something like this happens actually better than just directly assisting the scientific disciplines that are specifically dedicated to making advances like these?  That's difficult for me the believe.  While this may be a side effect of space programs, surely it's not the primary reason for their existence.\n\ntl;dr convince me that national space programs are worthwhile for reasons other than space is cool(even though it is)\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_33lkcg\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

CMV\n\nComment: There's no denying it, Fred Phelps was a man full of hate.  He was abusive and deplorably disrespectful.  However, he also held a Biblically justifiably position on hate and sin.  The Bible Phelps, and other Christians, believe in supports his worldview.\n\nFred Phelps preached hate because when he read the Bible, that's what spoke to him.  Phelps believed that God was capable of hate *and did hate*.  A lot.  [Some Biblical support from the WBC website.](http://www.godhatesfags.com/bible/God-hates.html)\n\n[This website](http://www.evilbible.com/) calculates that the God of the old testament is directly responsible for over one million deaths in the Bible.  It also points you to incidences of God demanding child murder, telling his chosen people to slaughter entire civilizations because they did not worship him, etc.  \n\n[Just for reference, here is a search for \"hate\" in the Bible.](http://www.openbible.info/topics/hate)  No bias, just verses.  \n\nI want to make it clear that I think the Bible can be used to justify other worldviews too.  The loving Christ of the New Testament is in stark contrast to the God of the Old Testament.  (Though even Christ spoke of the appropriateness of hate. \"\u201cIf anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.\" Luke 14:26)\n\nHowever, just like Fred Phelps ignores the message of love that can be found later in the Bible, most Christian denominations diminish the hateful, wrathful God and downplay his morally questionable behaviors.  \n\nI also want to point out that Phelps seems absolutely obsessed with the \"sin\" of homosexuality, all but ignoring the other sins.  This might explain something about his psychology.  It doesn't make him incorrect in his interpretation of the Bible.  \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a supporter of Fred Phelps or his position.  I grew up in a Southern Baptist family and I know the Bible so when I watched a few interviews I realized that despite the crazy packaging, the man had Biblical support for the hate he was spewing.  \n\nWell, there it is.

Western culture is European culture.  The linguistic, philosophical, artistic and political heritage of Europe. It\u2019s social norms and ethical values.  Inherent means to be an essential quality.  Racist means that white experiences and traits are privileged over others.  Sexist means that masculine experiences and traits are privileged over others.\n\nWestern culture has the essential quality of privileging white masculine experience and traits over others.  \n\nLinguistically, this essential quality manifests itself in all nouns being gendered in the Romance languages. Philosophically, western though has been universally dominated by men.  These men using their masculine experience as the sole epistemology with which to classify and label all aspects of the world.  Artistically, women are depicted as objects of beauty and desire, people\u2019s of color are barely depicted at all and white men are the creators of art.  Politically, well, it\u2019s fucking Europe,  2500 years of war, violence and oppression.  Alexander the \u201cGreat\u201d marches east.  The roman empire sends it\u2019s legions to all corners of the continent, killing indigenous peoples wherever it goes.  Those indigenous peoples resist an overtake the empire, so on and so on.

By this, I mean that you see, hear, taste, smell and feel nothing that is not filtered, processed or otherwise distorted by your brain.\n\nSo why does your brain filter, process and distort sensory information?  Because  your perceptual faculties are shaped by evolutionary pressures.  There is a selection advantage to accentuate survival maximising data that your senses pick up, and also to minimise sense-data that does not confer some sort of advantage, be it survival and/or reproductive.  That is to say that nobody's brain is selected for directly perceiving reality.  Only selected for perceiving elements of reality that relate to survival and promotion of genes.\n\nSo, I don't understand why it is appropriate to say that because someone who is psychotic, or under the effect of hallucinogens, has less legitimate contact with reality.  In fact, with psilocybin, brain regions that limit one's perception are temporarily inhibited and if anything, a more direct way of perceiving reality may be achieved.

Just some observations\n\nI believe that if you can drop out of school at 16, then if you elect to stay in, the school should not be babying you.\n\nExamples\n\n-If someone wants to use their cellphone quietly in class, provided that it doesn't distract others (making sounds, etc) its stupid for the teacher to intervene. \n\n-If someone wants to not hand in homework, etc, there should be no consequences. Their consequence is that they fail/do poorly. \n\n-If someone wants to do work from another class and/or not pay attention, that's their prerogative.\n\n-Gym is a ridiculous requirement. Kids should be preparing for college/work in their last years of high school, and gym does ZERO toward either.\n\n-If they want to skip classes, they should be able to pass the classes provided that they pass by doing well on homework, tests, etc, and skipping shouldn't be a factor.\n\nI believe that it is fair though to have teachers decide these policies for their individual classes. But these would be my policies if I were a teacher. I just think that school wide policies against skipping and cell phones are ridiculous. People 16 and above are not required to be in school, so its time to treat them like adults. \n\nI don't know. It might just be my high school (which is a public school) but I hear other schools have similar policies. \n\nOh, and oddly enough, I am a very liberal progressive guy. I still believe schools should provide a good education and should receive a lot of funding, I just think at a certain point its time to treat young people like adults.\n\n\nBoth Classes I'm Describing Are Honors/AP classes, so the same type of student is in both. These are both real-life classes I'm taking right now.\n\nHISTORY CLASS:\n\nAs an example, my history teacher this year has this philosophy. He has sort of communicated that he turns a blind eye to cellphones if they're not distracting, in contrast with the policy. He won't force you to do well in the class. \n\nAnd this teacher is one of the best that I've had in recent memory. No one ever uses their cellphones, or doesn't pay attention, or anything like that. I believe that its not just because he's a good teacher. I think its also because he treats students as adults, and that has created a sense of respect between the teacher and students.\n\nMATH CLASS:\n\nThis teacher has the direct opposite policy of my history teacher. She takes away cellphones on the first offense, and will call you out for not doing your work, not paying attention, or doing other work in her class. As a result, I constantly see people doing these things. I believe that its partially because of the fact that she doesn't treat students as adults.\n\nAuthor: t3_1telg2\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

For example, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that our current infrastructure is going to require [$5 Trillion worth of repairs in the next five years alone](http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2009/2/11/our-infrastructure-mess.html), and no politicians are even discussing how we're going to pay for it.

Although possibly a topic for another debate, morality and ethics are constantly changing in ways which the law already has trouble keeping up with and codifying properly. Adding a constitution into that mix makes the whole process 100 times slower, 100 times out of touch with the moral reality of the age and 100 times more ineffectual. \n2. The problem of hermeneutics. Like religious texts, written documents require interpretation and an understanding of the *context* that they were written in and constitutions are no exception. Look how dramatically different  the political, technical and social landscapes are now, compared to when the US constitution was originally written. ([this gun control ad is an apposite example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LORVfnFtcH0)) The debate over the 'spirit' of what was written will continue to get worse and worse as the landscape continues to change; wouldn't it be easier to just have a system where law can change along with the landscape? \n3.

For example jokes about black male criminals are not \"politically incorrect\" only because they are offensive. They are criticized because they are harmful - they reinforce the social structures that keep black men in poor circumstances. \"You're being too sensitive\" is a giant distraction - the world would be better off if people did not make jokes about black male criminals. This is why I oppose those jokes. Offensiveness has nothing to do with it.\n\nNow back to 1: There is a reasonable definition of political correctness - it is the idea that some views are unfairly silenced or opposed because some political group dislikes it rather than because the view is incorrect. However I think that accusations of political correctness are usually a harmful response for two reasons:\n\na) The debate quickly dissolves into a debate over whose viewpoint is being unfairly opposed or silenced (due to the hostile media effect, everyone thinks that they are the underdog - I can cite examples if needed).\n\nb) Instead of \"You're just being politically correct\". It is much more productive to say \"I think that what I have said is true, important and will bring about more benefit than harm. If you want to debate one of those, then do so.\"\n\nNow onto 2: the way that I usually see political correctness used is as a way to simultaneously claim that some widely held viewpoint is a brave and daring new insight (the puffin effect); and to shut down a certain class of criticisms against it as being \"politically correct\". In other words it is a way of insulating one's own beliefs, while also giving oneself a pat on the back for being oh so daring and edgy. Anyone who suggests that your claim might actually be harming other people is dismissed as being too \"politically correct\".\n\nTo CMV, it is not sufficient to say \"but political correctness is out of control! Look at all of these people that were unfairly punished for saying reasonable things\", you have to also demonstrate that political correctness is a useful way of communicating that problem. And you have to also show that the benefit of using the term outweigh the harms that I mentioned in 2 and to a lesser extent 1a.\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2aloc0\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

CMV\n\nComment: I believe that absolute values for moral and immoral behavior exist, and that every action is in fact made up of several separate moral and immoral components. Within this system moral behavior could be broadly described as that which endeavors to aid the human race, protect life and human rights, and preserve a healthy environment for the prolonged future of the species. Immoral behaviors could be similarly defined as those which are purposed to bring death or injury to another, those which benefit one member or subset of the human race at the expense of another, those which actively neglect another human in need, or otherwise do physical, emotional, spiritual or other harm to humans on any scale.\n\n\nFor example, a police officer responds to an armed robbery in progress. In the course of discharging his duties he is forced to fire his weapon at the perpetrator, killing him, to prevent the death of the victim. The police officer has done both a moral act (in protecting the life and property of the establishment and victim) as well as an immoral one (in taking a human life).\n\n\nObviously this system is flawed and the various \"shades of grey\" become harder and harder to distinguish in higher-order situations (such as making an immoral decision to preserve resources for a later, larger moral decision; or else the only \"pure white\" path through life would be to give away everything you own and wander the world doing what good you could without ever keeping anything for yourself). Personally, however, I take issue with the fact that I can't come up with a scenario which allows for one to realistically make it through life without making immoral choices.\n\n\nAll thoughts appreciated, of course, but specifically I'm looking for things which help me reconcile the fact that I'm pretty much doomed to make immoral choices and can't do anything about it. That could be showing me a way to work my system to \"live white,\" convincing me that the black/white line is in a different place than I believe, showing me how to be ok with living some shade of grey, or whatever else you brilliant folks come up with.

Such an aspect of well being obviously includes a child's physical health, including weight. While genetics do play a factor to an extent, and there are certain (and incredibly rare defects) that cause near unavoidable weight gain, the vast majority of people are not genetically predispositioned to be morbidly obese, and are more often than not a product of horrendously poor parenting. Obesity has more than just health risks, obese children are significantly more likely to die early deaths, suffer from low self-esteem, and be bullied in school. I believe that should a child get to a point where their weight is a significant risk to both their long term and short term health, the parents should be reviwed and face charges of child endangerment, and possibly abuse.  Due to the structure of due process, medical evidence could be heard if the child was a rare case of a glandular/pituitary gland problem, and extenuating circumstances could be taken into account.\n\nAuthor: t3_2f1t3o\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

CMV.\n\nComment: This is a bit of a frightening thing to post because people get very, very defensive about this sort of topic, and understandably so.\n\nI would like to start by saying that I am a gay rights activist. I have participated in protests, days of silence, and voted on all the pro-gay legislation I could. I have plastered my town in signs to vote \"Yes\" on gay marriage, and even defaced anti-gay displays (not that this in **any way** legitimizes me. The anecdote is provided for understanding of my views.) But I've never really accepted the \"T\" in the LGBT community.\n\nI am proud that a community could band together to support a group which faces discrimination and ostracization from the world at large. I'm not condemning the decision to defend a group of people who need defending. But I don't think trans-sexuality should be encouraged. \n\nFrom my point of view, the entire idea of the gay rights movement, and by larger extension the LGBT community, is to accept who you are. It asks you to accept yourself and to accept others as they were made, and to end judgement based on arbitrary terms like sexual preference or gender roles. That is why I want to fight for this community, to see more people happy and accepting themselves. Gay or not.\n\nBut I don't feel like trans-sexuality is self acceptance. I think it is self denial in the most extreme form. We cannot, scientifically, turn a man into a woman, or the reverse. We can remove organs. We can alter the shape and appearance of genitals. We can provide hormones which impart characteristics of a gender. But none of this truly changes a sex. Your given sex affects the development of your brain, which is something you couldn't change with all the surgeries in the world. So shelling out huge money and undergoing major biological changes just to chase the idea of the other side, it doesn't seem healthy to me. It seems like the ultimate denial. And I don't think we should be acting like it's an alternative to loving yourself for who and how you are naturally.\n\nI don't hate trans-gendered people and I don't want them to be treated unequally. They deserve love and compassion as much as anyone else. But I think we're doing a grave disservice by promoting it as a regular sort of thing. It is, undeniably, very unnatural. And it far overextends the boundaries of sexuality which LGB is literally named for. \n\n**In summary:** I don't understand why the practice of extreme bodily mutilation/manipulation gets mixed in which a stance on sexuality. I shouldn't have to support something which I think is totally misguided in order to support a civil rights movement that I think is just. I obviously mean no offense to people who were born a non-binary gender. This complaint is about the deliberate decision to make a binary gender an artificial version of the other and my supposed responsibility to defend it.\n\nI'm pretty set in my ways on this.

Its establishment via settler-colonialism, displacement of already-existing populations, offering of an exclusively Jewish \"right-of-return\" and continual occupation and colonization of Palestinian lands is untenable.\n\nThe maintenance of a state upon the basis of ethnic and/or religious identity is simply anathema to the idea of liberal democracy. Any country that is committed to maintaining a majority of one ethnicity over another and the expansion of its country as an ethic homeland is by definition non-inclusive and puts the priorities and interests of one ethic group over the other.\n\nTherefore, the two-state solution is effectively a denial of pluralism and multiculturalism in favor of antiquated notions of ethnic nationalism and separatism, a preference of colonialism and tribalism over coexistence. Extremist right wing groups on both sides of the conflict - motivated by these ethnic and religious reasons - have repeatedly repudiated the two-state solution, choosing instead to deny each other the right to live. \n\nThe state of Israel decreased the likelihood of a successful two-state solution each and every day by its continued occupation of the Palestinian territories and the complete social and economic subjugation of its people, all while supporting the continued construction of settlements in the West Bank. Their continued oppression and colonization of the occupied territories not only decreases the chances of the two-state solution, but radicalizes Palestinians, causing them to join Hamas and other reactionary organizations. It is a never-ending cycle of depravity and there is no indication that it would be stopped even after the creation of a Palestinian state. Israel is the dominant economic and political power in this uneven conflict and last year's military operation in Gaza - which can only be described as ethnic cleansing or collective punishment - is exemplary of this disparity.\n\nI believe the only permanent solution is the creation of a single binational state that combines all of Israel and the occupied territories. The state must be completely secular, democratic, and inclusive - not Arab or Jewish in character. No priority should be given to any ethnicity or religion. All Jewish settlements in the occupied territories must be immediately abandoned as a prerequisite. The right of return and full citizenship (or monetary remuneration) must be offered to all those displaced by Israel and their descendants. The new country will no longer be a Jewish state, but will continue to offer the original Jewish right of return. Rights for all minorities must be enshrined in the law so that Israeli Jews will never be targeted for retaliation based on their previous actions. This new state will be disarmed and have a permanent UN peacekeeping force throughout the country. Perhaps, if absolutely needed, a confessional system similar to Lebanon could be put in place to ensure that the Jewish people will never be disenfranchised. \n\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_30wxso\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

Regardless, seeing how FOSS (free and open-source software) stacks up against closed/proprietary software, it would seem like a no-brainer to use it in government.\n\nA few points to consider are:\n\n*  Open source technology ensures that anyone can see what goes into a program. This allows bugs and security holes to be found and repaired faster. Also, it weeds out the contributions of less qualified people since their algorithms will be replaced with better ones from more experienced/qualified people.\n\n* Open source prevents unapproved or suspicious modifications to the programs. It's hard to slip bad code through when, theoretically, every citizen can see how the entire code.\n\n*  Employing open source is a step towards transparency in government as a whole. If all the raw data government agencies churn out are publicly available, this will ensure consistency when some of that information is used by the media or other agencies. Also makes fact checking easier.\n\n* Reduced cost. Instead of paying someone to use their own proprietary algorithms, a lot (if not all) of the work can be done for the low price of free... or very little. Plus, you can check out their algorithm yourself.\n\nI have especially wondered if there are any downsides to successfully implementing this in light of the United States' healthcare website fiasco. I am sure an open source community would create a usable system (backend and frontend) on time and for less than what it cost taxpayers (I admit, I don't have the exact dollar amount for how much the website cost to get up). Even if only the frontend was open sourced, you'd get good ideas/recommendations for how best to set up the backend, and the GUI would actually make sense.\n\nAnother area that could benefit from an open source mentality is voting software (once again, applies strongly to Murica). How is a whole country OK with some private company owning voting machines and the [software that counts the votes??](http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/06/experimental-software-discreetly-installed-on-ohio-voting-machines/)\n\nFinally, imagine if your state DMV or veterans benefit applications websites were designed by people who actually used them.

CMV\n\nComment: First, I must say that the pursuit of better electric vehicles (henceforth denoted EV) is worthwhile.  As we find new and better ways to generate electricity, the EV will perhaps become the norm, so it makes sense to continue research and improvement on the cars, themselves. In this vein, some buyers may purchase EV's to deliberately give financial support to a budding technology, and that's great.  We will need nice, efficient vehicles to drive once everything else is worked out.  Those details that have not been worked out, however, create a dissonance in the idea of \"doing good\" by driving an EV.\n\nLet's take for granted all the energy that goes into creating an EV and maintaining its batteries.  I think there is probably a great argument that you'll never break even on the net energy poured into the production of a modern EV, but I want to ignore that aspect.   Let's say an EV just materializes, dropped off by aliens, perhaps.  With our current means of putting energy onto the electric grid, one may very well trade a gasoline powered vehicle for a coal powered one by choosing an EV, and that doesn't make much sense to me.  Alternative energies such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric need to comprise a much higher share of total energy production before running an EV can truly be considered a \"cleaner\" way to drive.

Maybe that's because it's stupid and easily refuted, but I need it laid out for me: no one explains how *equal protection under the law* somehow renders unconstitutional the *uniformly applied* right to marry someone of the opposite gender.\n\nLet me try to illustrate with a silly example. Suppose there was a law that gave everyone the right to record and publish a duet version of *Over the Rainbow*, but only so long as the other person of the duet resides in a different city than you. And say you get some tax break for doing this as a bonus.\n\nSome people may wish to record the duet with someone who lives in the same city they do. They may even despise the idea of recording the duet with someone outside their city. Can they claim the fact they can't get the tax break means they're denied equal protection? I don't think so. They basically have the same status as someone who doesn't wish to record the duet at all. For whatever reason, the law says the tax breaks kick in under only the conditions specified. You could say it's arbitrary but it's not unconstitutional because *everyone has an equal right under that law* whether or not everyone exercises it.\n\nAs with other rights, some people don't even desire to exercise the right, or would rather the right be expanded. Such as, some people don't want to own guns and some people want to own (illegal) automatic weapons. It doesn't mean there's no equal protection.\n\nIn the case of same-sex marriage there are extra emotional stakes. But I don't think this is constitutionally relevant. One could say the thing we're equally protecting is the *right to marry who you love* but as far as I know that's not a rationale for marriage in statute.

CMV\n\nComment: I often hear people say that the Westboro Baptist Church aren't \"true Christians\", oftentimes while simultaneously saying that they know about the [No True Scotsman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman) fallacy.  They often claim that since Jesus said the greatest commandment was to love god/neighbors as yourself, and their actions are demonstrably unloving, that they therefore can't really be considered followers of Christ's teachings.\n\nMy current position starts with the fact that \"Christianity\" wasn't used hardly at all in popular American vocab until the late 1800's.  There was no unifying label of Christianity - there were Baptists, Catholics, Quakers, etc, and the thought of using one label for all of them was kind of absurd and pointless...at least, until the rise in popularity of alt viewpoints coming from people like Mark Twain, Bertrand Russel, etc.  The coming together of various denominations under the banner of Christianity is an invention of the last 150 years, generously speaking.  \n\n(I'm sounding way too confident here in my knowledge of history, these are simply things as I understand them and I am very willing to be corrected about any of it)\n\nIt would be much easier when talking about WBC if they claimed a specific denomination with specific dogma, but when we're talking about a very broad classification that contains around 40,000 different denominations (based on a book containing shittons of arguable contradictions and translations), you're very limited in what you can say about someone being \"true\".  \n\nIf the WBC dogma surrounding god's nature was true, then their actions would be loving (and complacency in regards to the issues they care about would be unloving).  The WBC take their dogma from the book that classifies them as Christian.  You might can make an argument about how their interpretation is flawed, but that is completely besides the point when we're talking about NTS.  With that kind of rationale you could eliminate everything from the Crusades to the Inquisition to Pat Robertson, and all of a sudden Christianity is this thing that was only figured out sometime in 1994 (and even now there are probably more people that disagree with your position than agree).\n\nCMV\n\nAuthor: t3_1k6j0n\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

For those that, god forbid, don't already know:\n\n\nCalzones have several virtues over pizza.\n\n1) Calzones are easy to transport cleanly. By virtue of being surrounded by dough, no sauce or toppings are going to spill during transportation, making carrying a calzone a largely risk free proposition.\n\n2) Calzones maintain their temperature better over distances because their encompassing crust acts as insulation for the pipping hot toppings in the center. \n\n3) As any New Yorker will tell you, the proper way to eat pizza is to fold it in half with each end of the crust pointing upwards, and the crust itself enveloping the toppings. Sound familiar? It should, because it's a calzone!\n\n4) Calzones can be filled with more ingredients than a typical pizza by virtue of their design. Since they are a stuffed bread, there is little risk of excess toppings threatening the structural integrity of the calzone. With a pizza, the more you put on, the greater the risk to the integrity of the pizza, particularly when you take an individual slice. Ever had ingredients slide off the top of a pizza slice just as you were about to take a bite? Sounds like a bit of a food engineering problem. Allow me to introduce the solution: calzones. \n\n5) Calzones reduce wast. Calzones can be baked more readily to sizes fitting an individual portion. Personal pizzas are possible, but are rarely seen in the pizza world. Pizza is a group food, and most restaurants provide that option. To help meet individual needs, slices are offered. However, this introduces the problem of waste. If slices remain unsold, what remains of a pizza will inevitably be thrown out. This is wasteful! Calzones don't have that problem. Calzone's are generally made to order for the individual in a size an individual can eat. One calzone for one person. No waste!\n\nTo me, the answer is clear. We should become a calzone nation. Thank you Benn Wyatt for revealing the truth. \n\n\n1) Presentation. Pizza can be presented visually in ways a calzone cannot.\n\n2) Preparation. Pizza can be cooked in ways that produce an ideal outcome in terms of flavor a way that calzones cannot because the toppings are directly exposed to heat.\n\n3) Pizza is a superior social food as it is more easily shared. \n\n4) Pizza can at least *approximate* some of the advantages of a calzone by folding a slice in half.  \n\n5) Calzones have to have more bread relative to the number of toppings (this is disputed, but if true it is certainly a point in pizza's favor)\n\n6) Moisture buildup is a problem if you add too many moist toppings into a calzone. This prevents certain combinations in a calzone that can be put on a pizza, and is why many times sauces are delivered as a separate item in a ramekin.\n\n7) Calzones cool slower and less evenly, making it difficult to eat on the spot, and meaning that you will get an uneven flavor experience. \n\nThese are all very good points. I will have to think this over more. If I change my mind, I will start deep dishing out deltas.\n\nAuthor: t3_2g1ea5\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

If someone doesn't love you for who you are, you're better off finding someone else.\"\n\nThese sounds like perfectly reasonable pieces of advice. Here's the problem though: this advice discourages people from honestly assessing their strengths and weaknesses and making concerted efforts to improve themselves as a person. It encourages complacency. We should always be seeking to change, reinvent ourselves, and evolve. If people have spent their lives being extremely unsuccessful at dating, clearly something is wrong and something has to be done to improve the situation. People don't accidentally fail at dating. \n\nUnfortunately, this is advice is grounded in the horrifically unbalanced way in which Hollywood depicts romance &amp; relationships. Our society has the broken notion that even the unmotivated , slightly out of shape and comically awkward guy always seems to get the girl. I'm sick and tired of hearing the old and obviously wrong notion that love is something that just falls in your lap rather than something that needs to be worked for and earned. Society doesn't owe me anything. Women especially but occasionally men often fall into the trap of fate and \"The One\". No magic is involved with finding someone to date. The harsh reality is that if you don't earnestly work on becoming a better, more appealing person, there is no reason for the girl or guy \"of your dreams\" to want to be with you. If you have flaws, it is better to work on improving yourself than to sit back and expect to find an amazing partner regardless.\n\n\nFar better if more nuanced advice would be something along the lines of \"Don't be yourself... Become the best version of yourself.\" Working hard to improve yourself is important for any area of life, whether it be academics, sports, business or any field. No one ever told Wayne Gretzky to \"just be yourself\" when he was starting out in hockey. He still needed coaches to point out when he had flaws in his play and where improvement was needed.\n\nTL;DR Society has the wrong idea when they tell people to be themselves in order to succeed in dating. Hollywood unfortunately pushes the idea of fate and one true soulmate which is not in line with real life. Better advice is to encourage real growth and development, not to fall into a pattern of stagnation.

I think digital piracy (for the most part) is not only not immoral, but probably necessary. CMV\n\nComment: Firstly, digital piracy is illegal. Anyone who does anything illegal whether you agree with it or not should be prepared to face the consequences.\n\nThat said, the *only* reason that piracy is illegal is because the creators of digital media are either unable to or unwilling to update their business models to suit today's technology. The fact that some people argue that *the consumer* should be the one to adapt, rather than the companies and creators themselves, is baffling to me.\n\nClaiming that piracy is immoral is like saying, \"walking into my house is immoral.\" No it's not, it's just some arbitrary rule I just made up.\n\nBut of course the argument is that you're \"stealing\" or that you're \"taking profit away from creators,\" which is similarly absurd. Piracy is not \"stealing.\" You are not taking something from someone else, you are making a copy of something. The entirety of what makes stealing immoral is the fact that you are disturbing/harming/inconveniencing/etc someone else by taking something that belongs to them. This is not what is happening with digital piracy.\n\nThe only \"inconvenience\" caused from piracy is the idea that someone *may* *theoretically* have lost some *theoretical* money. And again, this is not because digital files have any value, but because of the arbitrary, outdated business model that media companies have.\n\nMaking piracy illegal implies that people are downloading things that they would have otherwise paid for, i.e people just want free shit. But obviously this isn't true, all you have to do is look at the amazing success of things like iTunes and Netflix. People don't mind paying for media, as long as it's good, cheap, and convenient. I suspect that companies and creators know this, but they are just trying to maximize profits. And I doubt I'll ever be in favor of screwing over the consumer just so you can maximize profits.\n\nSo not only do I not have a problem with piracy, I almost feel that it is compulsory to force companies and creators to, as they say, *get with the times.* How can they update their business model to take advantage of the ease at which we can download and transfer digital files? Well A. That's another discussion and B. It's not really my problem. The fact of the matter is, you don't throttle the use of technology so you can make more money. Screw that.

CMV\n\nComment: You may have heard a couple of stories about a man being raped by a woman and then having to pay child support for the kid. Or a kid who was raped by a woman (I think he was 13 or 15 at the time) and then having to do the same. Or some stories about women lying to their partners that they are on birth control so that they can get pregnant.\n\nI believe that in this circumstances, men should have the ability, in those places where abortion is legal, to force the woman to abort.\n\nMy rationale is this: the child will be born a child of rape. That on itself is terrible. Then it would be born to a broken home, since one of its parents raped the other. On top of that, the man is now obligated to aid his rapist (not just a criminal, but his abuser) to raise their child, while sharing the rights. Since the man never wanted the child and did all he could to prevent its birth (he was raped, he had no choice), I don't think he should be obligated to raise it.\n\nNow, since just forfeiting the obligation to raise it would still leave the child to its own fate, in the best interest of all, the best alternative is to prevent it from existing. Thus, the one just way I find is to have the embryo aborted. If the woman refuses, too bad.

I think of them as stamp or coin collectors - think what happens when you try and take an album from an avid collector (\"who needs so many stamps, most of which are cancelled anyway!\").\n\nIt should be no surprise that many pieces of regulation provoke the same response. And they should - think about recent pieces of legislation that limited the number of rounds in magazine to 7. It just so happens that many highly collectable military guns from WWI and WWII are over this limit - and now you said that someone who have just paid $5000 for a fully matching (including the magazine!) WWII Luger needs to get rid of this pesky mag - which will lower the value of the gun by 2/3.\n\nNow, stamps or coins can't kill people, right?\n\nThis is true, of course, BUT forcing restrictions on guns, especially the ones that make very little impact on the actual number of deaths (majority of gun legislation has been recently focused on mass murder, which kills fewer people per year than lightning) pushes a very large number of people into Republican camp. This is especially true for white middle class males with less than high school education, who benefit the least from Republican policies, yet are drawn to them because of red meat issues such as gun control.\n\nMy assertion is that letting Republicans own gun issue kills vastly more people than gun legislation prevents. If we took gun people from the Republican camp, they would have no change for legislative victories in their current ultra-rightwing form. Many wars would not have happened, saving literally hundreds of thousands of people (it will take a few hundred years for our current gun legislation to just make up for Iraq body count, for instance). We would have had better health care, sooner, also saving tens of thousands per year.\n\nSo IMHO, based strictly on the body count, our current attempt of gun legislation is a VERY BAD THING. CMV!\n\n\nI am pointing out that there are specific firearms that have NO IMPACT on violence at large, yet are the first ones targeted. The proponents of this legislation justify it by saying that it is worth it even if it saves one life.

When I first started shaving, my grandfather taught me how to shave properly using a safety razor.  I have used disposable razors or razors that use disposable cartridges before, but I've found that they are less comfortable and they don't get as close of a shave at all.  All of that is simply my opinion.  But here's the facts: you are losing a lot of money by not switching to classic shaving.  You can buy a Dovo Shavette Straight Razor on Amazon for just under $30.00 and a 100 ct. box of Derby blades to go with it for $9.62.  You can use each side of the blade multiple times before it gets dull, and you can soak your blades in baby oil to keep them sharp before you switch to a new one.  So for ~$40, you can shave your face almost EVERY DAY for an entire year this way.  The alternative?  You can buy a cheap plastic Gillette razor handle for around $15 at your local store and an 8-pack of disposable blades to go with it (which you can only use 1-2 times) for $30 dollars.  So for $45 you can get a couple months worth of shaving if you only shave once a week this way.  \n\nOther than not knowing about this method, I can't see why anyone would CHOOSE to buy low quality disposable razors and razor blade from the store when you can actually save a couple hundred bucks and get a better shave, not to mention shave more frequently whenever you feel like it or the need arises.

This profit-seeking has resulted in a society in which Americans are divided into two distinct classes- the owners of capital, and those that find themselves as wage slaves. \n\nThis is driven by the reality that the wealthy will leverage the desperation of the poor to realize further profits- an act of coercion that is at the root of American inequality.\n\nCapitalists often rationalize this by appealing to the idea of \"private property\", which they insist must be preserved, as aggression is (according to them), in and of itself, a moral wrong.    \n\nI find this position fails to take into account the historic violence that underlies our current capitalist system.\n\nAlmost every patch of land on Earth was obtained through violence at some point in its history. The stolen land was later inherited or sold until it reached its present owners. Thus, property over land and natural resources is based on the initiation of force.  By extension, private ownership of all goods originally derived from violence, as natural resources are required in the production of all goods.\n\nThe exploitation of the working class, the environment, and the like, in the pursuit of profit, then, is an assault against all of humanity.

I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans, they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality, but really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better, because of the side of a line they are born on, that are at fault. Patriotism is really just this belief.\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2rc3p3\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

I believe the culture in which a person lives can influence at least some people to be gay/bi/pedofilic.\n\nI have two general reasons for this belief. First, I have read a few accounts of people in the modern day that grew up in a gay subculture bubbles, lived gay lifestyles for long periods because of this, and the later realized they were straight. I feel like as homosexuality becomes more widespread and accepted many nominally straight kids might be attracted to it as the \"new thing\" or just grow up in that environment and think of themselves as gay. My second, and for me, much more important reason, is that historical fact that certain societies had much higher rates of homosexuality/pedofilia than we have today, an example of this being ancient Greece. If homosexuality (or pedofilia) is entirely based on biology, shouldn't the rate of homosexuality be consistent with very little variation across all societies?\n\nCMV\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2etqul\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

As a reaction, in the US there is a backlash movement that encourages people to love themselves.

The USA did it very simply: Limited government (oversight, rules , regulations and bureaucracy) The founding fathers understood that all governance is necessary but equally hungry and evil, thus they established means to keep the three branches of government in balance. The other \"legs\" of right wing political philosophy are PERSONAL property rights, The Rule of law, and that the government works for the citizen (PUBLIC servants) and it is none of the government's business what you want, do (legally) with your life, liberty and pursuit of happyness. Politically you can move left from there.. to probably the most Left Wing government on earth North Korea,probably the farthest you can get from the right wing \"Baby America\". From this simple \"political\" comparison and you see that it's \"left wingedness\" looks more like Fascist Germany than Early America..

One even went so far as to call me an \u201casshole mom\u201d, which I found ironic.  Moms are quick to cry fowl when someone questions their beliefs and refuse to listen to opposing views maturely.

Passing laws that specifically and exclusively ban texting while driving is asinine [cmv]\n\nComment: The number of people texting and driving has gone up by a HUGE number. If, as so-called \"studies\" show, texting is the most dangerous action - even worse than drunk driving, the number of accidents would have increased.\n\nPerhaps other factors are offsetting the increase in accidents form Texting. Even in that case common sense as well as your own experience will show you that taking your eyes off the road to text is little different than taking your eyes off the road to eat, put on make-up, fiddle with the CD player, turn around to talk to other people in the car, read, watch a video, write notes, play air drums while rocking out to the radio, and many more actions. Not saying it is any safer than those things, but it is certainly not any more dangerous.\n\nThe idea of passing laws that specifically and exclusively make texting illegal is silly. We don't have a law that says you can not stab someone. We don't have 78,519 laws that ban specific ways to harm someone. We just have laws against assault and battery. There is no need for laws that single out texting while driving. All you need are existing laws against distracted driving\n\nThe only reason I can imagine why some are making texting to be the single most evil thing to do on the road is far more young drivers will text and drive than older people. 20 years make for a better target than the 50 year old who is eating, reading, and driving with his knees.\n\nAuthor: t3_1vow52\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

I just don't think universities are an appropriate environment for them to be taught in. I think the only subjects that should be taught in universities are ones that meet the following three criteria:\n\n* Difficult to learn without a teacher\n* Not subjective\n* Not best learned by practice*\n\nFor example, if you want to become a writer, the absolute best thing you can do is spend a bunch of time writing. But if you want to learn calculus, you can't do that by practicing algebra a bunch. I think liberal arts should be taught in a more casual setting, like a writer's group, or through tutors, and only harder subjects should be taught at universities.\n\n* There seems to be some confusion, which is my fault. I mean not best learned by practice *alone*.

CMV.\n\nComment: \nGenerally, women face a plethora of impediments that men do not. In employment settings, women are less likely to get promoted than men (due to a variety of concepts, including 'the glass ceiling', or the idea that women aren't trusted to tackle top leadership positions, and the widespread view of employers that women who have children aren't likely to be dedicated workers). They have less areas of employment that are reasonably accessible to them, even though men in female-dominated positions like primary education or nursing are frequently noticed as exceptional workers and fast-tracked to success. They're expected to undertake a 'second shift' at home, as cooking, cleaning, and child care is still done primarily by women in dual-sex households. They're subject to ridicule and constant sexualization in male-dominated spaces, but are ostracized and chided for their inability to take a joke when they express their discomfort.  \n\nMany men seem to feel that women have the seamless ability to coast through life by relying on a man. First of all, this only applies to young, attractive women (and, given preferences, non-whites are additionally disadvantaged). Second of all, even if many beautiful women can get men to sleep with them, that doesn't guarantee marriage. Even if it did, that doesn't guarantee financial stability, merely that they can find a spouse (and then, even if they found someone who was rich, they have, at best, a dependent status that is likely to decline with age). \n\nMoreover, women are valued on the merit of their attractiveness rather than their intelligence/ability/personality far more than the converse is true. It's very difficult to get a job or access many social spaces without performing a variety of beauty rituals, including shaving all of your body hair, doing your hair with regularity, applying cosmetics, and carefully selecting clothes. Appearance isn't meaningless for men, but it's far less socially required. \n\nYou're all familiar, likely, with several common social conventions, including the slut/prude dichotomy (which doesn't exist for men to nearly the same degree it does for women), the inability to express aggression or frustration without being perceived as an bossy, shrill, bitch, and the tendency to ascribe a wide variety of negative traits (being bad at math or science, etc) to their gender, discouraging further improvement and closing off potential routes to self-improvement and success. \n\nI'm curious what MRA's have to say when confronted with this line of argument. \n\nCMV. \n\nAuthor: t3_1mlh17\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

I feel that having open auctions (with a leaderboard of sorts showing the minimum bid required for a ticket/first shipment item) would solve many problems we have to deal with when things sell out in minutes or even seconds, and they show up on ebay the same day.\n\nThe only real downsides I've thought of are: \n\n1. The lucky few who manage to beat scalpers for their products (it's awkward wording this so it applies to tickets and hardware equally) would instead have to pay market price.\n\n2. Retailers may not play ball with auctions. But honestly, they could be offered the same proportional cut of the added revenue and see things a bit differently. Also, not having people trampled in stores has to be worth something.\n\nBut the upside so easily trumps it, in my opinion:\n\n1. **Kill the resale market**. An auction that's open as close to the show/launch/initial shipment would mean that the market would be well established, and would only have from the close of the auction to the day of the event (or the next shipment) to grow. This would significantly increase the risk for scalpers, and make it not worth the trouble in almost every case.\n\n2. **More money to the people responsible for the product**. Ever wish your favorite artist would come to your hometown more often? Make shows more profitable and they just might. If Oculus had auctioned off places in each wave of shipments of the Rift, that added revenue might've let them put off selling for a bit longer, or possibly even altogether (both the facebook deal and the one before it). And the current plan to sell the consumer version at or near cost may only again bolster the resale market should they underestimate demand.\n\n3. **Elastic price to react to elastic value**. What was the value of a Wii in November 2006? Or a PS2 in 2000? How about a Tickle Me Elmo or Furby when people were going crazy for them? Now what were they worth the following Spring? Letting them be auctioned off would allow for the extra revenue without being burned later on by the drastic change in what people are willing to pay for the product. It also prevents these items being sold at retail for so much less than their actual initial value, which is what allows for the existence of the scalping market to begin with.\n\nCan anybody change my view?\n\nAuthor: t3_2atbmd\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

So in people who don't want to pass on their genes something must have \"gone wrong\" in the code.

CMV\n\nComment: 1. The U.S. is the dominant world power. This is an envious position and one that is first and foremost determined by military strength, from which other strengths are derived (for better or for worse). To lose this dominance would be catastrophic, therefore justifying the position of the federal government as being responsible for keeping the U.S. far ahead of other powers in terms of military strength.\n\n2. If the strength of a nation is viewed economically, the U.S. is still dominant due in large part to the industry generated by military/defense projects. Though many of these efforts can lead to weaponry and other dangerous materials, much modern technology with peaceful applications (radar and GPS are major examples) was originally researched for military use. \n\n3. Institutions funded under this budgetary umbrella, from research centers to military hospitals to the large bases scattered across the nation, provide secure employment and education for large numbers of Americans. I think that this is something that is often overlooked: for example I advocate increased spending on veteran healthcare and housing, as well as efforts similar to the GI Bill. In a time of high unemployment providing people with secure employment is a huge benefit. This also goes for the large private companies (like Boeing and Honeywell) and large research universities (both public and private) that depend upon defense contracts with the federal government.\n\n4. I think that this is, at heart, a question of semantics: for example, people often lament the reductions in the budget of NASA, when in fact much space exploration technology (NASA or otherwise) is being developed under a military framework. DARPA was created in response to the 'technological surprise' in the U.S. upon the launch of Sputnik by the Soviets, leading to the NASA programs that put men on the moon. In short: would the NASA Curiosity rover program be any less impressive if it was conducted by DARPA? Would it surprise anyone to learn that DoE facilities like Livermore or Los Alamos are primarily military research centers?\n\n5. I believe that there is a compelling argument to be made that money is often wasted via the bureaucracy of these military/defense institutions, but I do not think that translates into an argument for decreased spending. The best course of action is to reform within the basic structure, so that much-maligned services (like veterans affairs) can be revitalized with the money saved.\n\n6. Finally, I see no problem in embracing military strength as an essential American ideal, and I see our continued military strength as evidence of the intelligence and industry of the American people (and by extension, Western Civilization). We should always confront our failures to adhere to this ideal (I do not support much of the American military's conflicts since WWII), but this does not take away from the importance of dedicated time, money, and research towards military/defense initiatives.\n\nAuthor: t3_1wipir\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

Since the invention of the internet, many of the questions that we test become obsolete. For high school exams, memorizing specific dates, names, functions etc. are fairly pointless when you could look it up in 5 seconds. Even in university, when writing essays becomes common, producing an analysis of passages in such a short time and stressful environment is not an indication many times of how much one knows, but often how much they have memorized what is mentioned in class. In particular, computer science exams, consisting of writing programs with no aid, is extremely ineffective and does not examine how much one actually knows of a subject.\n\nI believe a much better assessment would be through the use of final assignments, where students have a larger time in a less stressful environment.

One of the most common is that gay marriage somehow cheapens their marriage or that marriage is between defined as being between a man and a woman. \n\nIgnoring the glaring flaw, that marriage is specifically not defined as between a man and a woman (in America), people should be looking at this stance as religious intolerance. first off, their are christian churches that are willing to marry Gay people. So right off the bat, to take this stand against gay marriage is being intolerant against certain forms of christianity. Many Buddhist sects are also accepting of gay marriage. \n\nSo when you look at the fact that multiple different religions have opposing views, how could you possibly come to any conclusion other than the fact that you are being intolerant of other religious traditions? \n\nThe part of my title that mentions civil unions is a response to another common argument by anti gay marriage advocates, which is that they just don't think it should be called marriage between same sex partners. This still falls under the category of being intolerant because you are trying to dictate what their religious beliefs label their union but it brings up another concern. If you think that marriage is a religious term, why do you think the government should be issuing marriage certificates to anybody when we are supposed to have a separation of church and state in this country? Shouldn't it be the same as most of the rest of the world where you can get a government union and then have a religious ceremony separately?

CMV\n\nComment: A few years ago back in high school I was hanging out with some friends in my neighborhood when we decided to go visit another mutual friend who lived down the street. When we got to his house, we rang the doorbell and heard a dog barking inside. I have a dog, albeit a small dog, and am very familiar with their classic behavior of barking at whichever stranger arrives at the front door and subsequently running up to them and checking them out. I had never had a bad experience with dogs and wasn't freaked out by them at that point in time, so when we walk in and I spot this kid's German Shepherd at the top of the stairs, I don't think much of it. The dog is barking, starts to run down the stairs, and I start to brace myself in the event that the dog jumps up on me to sniff me or what not, but I'm not afraid at all. Then suddenly the dog jumps up and onto my friend standing directly on my left, bites into his shoulder, and thrashes his head back in forth. When they finally pulled the dog off my friend, he was bleeding all over the place. I've never seen someone's flesh so torn up. After we left to take him to the hospital, I couldn't help but think that that could just as easily been me. The dog apparently had no history of that kind of thing. Why he bit my friend, no one knows. He wasn't displaying any kind of aggressive behavior, wasn't being threatening, he was literally just standing there and within 15 seconds of being in the room, he was attacked.\n\nNeedless to say, this event left me pretty scarred and I have never been able to look at big dogs the same way. My belief stems from my opinion that while dogs can learn to trust their owners after being fed and cared for over a long period of time, they are **simply too unpredictable to be considered safe for strangers**. There is no way you can know the behavior of a dog at first glance, whether it is friendly or aggressive. Even good natured, well trained dogs can't be considered safe, because if they perceive you as a threat to their owner, they will attack you defensively. \n\nI'm writing this post because I have recently become friends with a few people who have bigger dogs and I know in my head that it is illogical for me to feel this way, but I just can't shake the fear. I just want to be able to sit on the couch, or walk into a room, and not be on edge all the time that the dog is going to go berserk. So, please please please help me out Reddit and CMV!\n\nAuthor: t3_1jcbnv\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

Obviously, in the situation where you put developing minds in a room together for 12 years of their life then they of course will learn SOMETHING, because human children are hard-wired to learn stuff.

They control almost the entire west coast of the former United States, and have conquered many great civilizations such as Vault City, the Enclave and the Brotherhood of Steel, but as they began to take more and more land, their forces began spreading thinner and thinner, and now the NCR controls so much land that they can not even protect their citizens from raiders. It is stated numerous times throughout Fallout: New Vegas that the Legion does have the military power to protect it's citizens and trade routes. How can an empire support it's citizens if it cannot protect them? The raider groups of the Mojave would have died out quickly if the Legion took control, but instead the NCR have turned New Vegas into their puppet state and refused to properly attack the raiders from the source, destroying the threat, and putting many towns like Goodsprings in danger.\n\nTheir lack of security has also lead to the NCRCF riots and subsequent take-over and raids, which has put the Mojave region in chaos due to the large amount of escaped convicts raiding areas and killing NCR Troopers. This would never happen under Caesar's command.\n\n**Secondly,** the NCR's economy is down the toilet. While the NCR may have forced the Brotherhood of Steel into hiding, they failed to protect their valuable gold supplies, resulting in the collapse of the economy. The NCR dollar is worth less than a bottle cap, which is pretty sad. Conversely, the Legion denarius is worth 4x the amount of the cap, and while this is still low, it is far better than the NCR's dollar. An economy like this can support the citizens properly, and as the Legion presumably still use the gold standard, they can properly manage their economy and not cause it to go out of control.\n\n**Thirdly,** the NCR suffers from extreme corruption, far worse than what occurs within the Legion. Approval of President Kimball is incredibly low, and the country is on the verge of falling apart with him still in office. The fact that he is still the President even with such low approval ratings is proof that the NCR is rife with corruption. Kimball has been in office for 9 years, far longer than he should have been in office with such low approval. The Legion does not suffer from this, as Caesar has developed a cult of personality around himself, and he is virtually loved by all within the Legion.\n\nNow despite all of this, there are still some things that the Legion does that are around the same level of \"badness\" as the NCR.\n\n**1.** Both the Legion and the NCR use prisoners as slave labour, with slaves being forced to carry stones up mountains at the Fort and slaves being forced to destroy railroads with dynamite in the NCRCF.\nThe Legion is considerably worse about this, however, as the Legion do take women and children as prisoners.\n\n**2.** Both the NCR and the Legion use conscripts as a major part of their militaries, resulting in many being forced to kill for their countries. However, the Legion does this considerably better, as most of their military are willing to die for Caesar, and ferociously loyal, whereas the NCR Troopers just want to go back to California to see their families.\n\n**3.** Both countries are on the brink of civil war. The NCR has extremely low approval ratings and poverty, whereas if Lanius takes over, his approval ratings will also drop and plunge the country into civil war. Both countries can easily be saved by getting another person to take their place.\n\nI definitely found myself agreeing with Caesar when he said that the NCR was best under Tandi's rule, and she was essentially the Queen of the NCR, ruling for over 50 years and being titled as \"President for Life\".\n\nNow, i'm not saying that I think that the Legion the best nation ever, I'm just saying that they are the best choice for the Mojave and the Wasteland.\n\nSo, please, somebody, change my view.\n\n\nAuthor: t3_25xgob\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

This events can go from a one person assassination to big massacres with thousands of victims.\n\nBut the way that social media treats each one of these cases upsets me. Firstly, a hundred people being killed in a poor country like Pakistan is much more irrelevant that the same amount of victims being killed in a rich country, like France or the USA, but that's not the issue I want to talk about today.\n\nI'm going to talk more about the USA in the next paragraph. I know these things happen in other parts of the world, but you know what? Even here in Europe, the USA news seem to be more important that the news related to any other continent or geographic area.\n\nSo, since I started watching the news more attentively, I've noticed that there's many gun violence episodes every year in the USA (again, I know this happens in other countries). In fact, I found this on Wikipedia:\n\nThese numbers are scary, at least for me. I'm absolutely **not** going to discuss whether the US government should or shouldn't take actions about this issue. But I've seen many news about gun shootings, especially in schools. However, many (there are exceptions) of those incidents are forgotten within a week or less .\n\nAnd we have bomb explosions. Yes, there are horrendous. Yes, I'm absolutely against people who made it or plan to do it. However, I start to think that the social media consider it much more horrendous that a gun shooting massacre. I'm not saying it'll be preferable to have this or that incident. Both crimes are horrible. But let me give you an example:\n\nAlmost a year ago we had the Boston Marathon bomb explosions. Hideous act. But (and I'm going to hell because of what I'm saying) only four people died. I know many people got seriously injured and they didn't deserve that. I'm aware of all that. I'm aware people got scared and they saw their security taken away. I know people in the Boston area got very emotional a year ago because of that event (believe me. Despite living in Europe, I'm a Red Sox fan and I saw that crowd at the tributes). Now, it'll be a year since the explosions happened, and the TVs from my own country will certainly remember us of what happened.\n\nBut I remember some gun shootings that hadn't half of the importance of the Boston bombings, even those in which more that 10 people died. Why? Is it because the shootings are supposed to be a normal thing? Is it because the bombs are placed by foreigns who don't like the USA?\n\nTL;DR: I think if two criminal incidents have the same amount of victims, they should have the same importance.\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_22oxbh\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

That said I really don't like Liberterianism. I'm no Communist and believe the far left is as bunk  as the far right.  Then Why do I hate Libertarianism you may ask? Because I believe Libertarianism is selfishness turned into a political philosophy, that is all. The only Liberty in Libertarianism is the liberty to amputate yourself from society and only opt to care about your fellow countrymen when it suites you.\n\nIt is a well established fact since the time of the Romans that taxation works. If you want nice things from your government, it needs the money to pay for them. Now Libertarians do not want the government to have nice things- thus causing deregulation and lowering taxation. However they never stopped to consider that maybe People less fortune then them NEED these things from the Government to survive; and it would be sure nice to drive on a road without potholes.\n\nLibertarians bemoan how big government is a problem and it needs to be downsized. Government is big because it needs to govern a big population and a big Area effectively. Granted Bureaucracy can often be stifling, but only with the active participation in government can it be fixed. You don't amputate your hand when you get a paper cut. Furthermore Regulation are there for a reason. when economies are completely unregulated- despite sometimes good intentions- they move towards wrecking themselves. It is a historical fact. I know the world is looking for solutions in the wake of the GFC- Libertarian Economics is not it. Most mainstream economists regard the work of Libertarian poster economist Ludwig Von Mises as bunk. Furthermore I would point out that the Austrian School as whole has flaws in regards to mathematical and scientific rigor. \n\nThis country was not founded by Libertarians they built this government so it could be expanded and tweaked in order to create a more perfect union. Not to be chopped up piecemeal and transformed into a feudal backwater. Also there is a reason why Ron Paul is not president- not because of the mainstream media censoring him- it is because his ideas are BAD, even by the standards of the GOP. Finally Ayn Rand is not a good philosopher. Objectivism is pure malarkey. Charity and Compassion are intrinsic to the human social experience- without them your just vain, selfish and someone who does not want to participate in the Human experience.\n\nPerhaps I would like to see ideas for fixing the government other than mutilating it. Ideas that would help all Americans not just the privileged few. Government is there for a Reason. So Reddit, am I crazy? does Libertarianism work in the 21st century? \n\nAuthor: t3_1jmlq3\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

CMV.\n\nComment: I've been reading the recent top thread about organ donation and couldn't find a good place to jump in with my opinion, I made a new thread. A large majority of the comments in the organ donation thread rely on the argument that \"you\" have a right to decide what happens to your body. I, however, would say that there is no \"you\" to even have rights. You are dead and gone.\n\nIn one comment, someone made the comment that you must lose rights to your body at some point. Eventually, you decompose, your bones are ground to dust, and the molecules that make you up are scattered about the earth. It is highly probably that some of the molecules that make up your body once made up the body of Julius Caesar. Should Mr. Caesar have the right to decide what happens to those molecules? No. That would be ridiculous. I simply say that the point when \"you\" lose those rights is immediately after death.\n\n**Anticipating some objections**\n\nPossessions and wills - I still support the idea of distributing your possessions as you wish via a will. This does not contradict my view, as the will can be viewed as taking effect immediately before death and not after. Your body is not your possession in the usual sense. You possess it while you are alive, but after you are dead there is no \"you\" to possess it any more.\n\nReligious arguments - I am not religious and I support the complete separation of church and state. To me, what this means is that no law can include any sort of religious beliefs in its justification. \"Some people believe their immortal soul will be destroyed if their body isn't treated in a certain way\" is a religious justification, and I don't think it can be used to determine laws. I can't think of any other justifications for giving dead people rights in the eyes of the law, but I'm open to suggestions. \n\nHow this relates to organ donation - I would vote for mandatory organ donation. No opting at all. Lets say 5 people can be saved by the organs of one body. By not using the organs, the are losing their right to life. And this is an attempt to give rights to a person that I don't even believe exists, because they are dead. That seems nonsensical to me.\n\nMaking organ donation optional for the purpose of not freaking people out - In some places, if organ donation were made mandatory, people would leave, or take some other drastic and undesirable action. Possibly a large fraction of people. This is a good reason for making organ donation optional, but it has nothing to do with rights and everything to do with practicality.\n\nFunerals - I don't believe people have the right to have their body disposed of in a way they desire. If they (or their family) has the money to do something specific with their body, they are free to do so, however, nobody should be under any obligation to give them a specific burial or anything like that. \"But wait\", you might say, \"how are they free to have a burial of their choice if their organs get harvested?\" and this is a good question. I view dead bodies as a natural resource. If the resource is useless, as most bodies are, it can be returned to the family. If it is extremely useful, as some bodies are (anything that can save 5 lives falls into the category of extremely useful in my opinion) then the useful parts should be used, and the rest can be returned to the family, after reasonable effort is put into making the body presentable.\n\n**One last, simpler reason for my belief**\n\nInanimate object do not have rights. Dead bodies are inanimate objects. Therefore, dead bodies have no rights. A lamp or a tree does not have the right to determine how it gets used, why should a dead body?\n\nAuthor: t3_1vxa67\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

The work is usually menial and grueling. They are rarely things I am passionate about. I once worked a minimum wage job over the summer and it was extremely boring and felt pointless. I came to this conclusion as a consequence from working that job.\nMy viewpoint has pushed me to work harder to find better opportunities. For example, I always strive for better paying jobs by searching through multiple mediums (web, newspaper, friends, etc.). I also once came up with my own lesson plan to teach junior high students which landed me 20$ an hour. I sell things on the internet for profit. I own stocks and do market research. I also simultaneously have MORE time for personal use such as reading, leisure etc. If I want to go to the library, I can. If I want to hang out with friends, I can because I don't have to work a grueling night shift for measly pay. If I settled for a minimum wage job, I never would have pushed myself to find better opportunities out there which takes time and effort. By the way, I am 19.\nI'm asking because it seems like my view point is offending a lot of people. I think it is because some of them work for near minimum wage and they believe I am looking down on them as people.

I do not mean by this that they are not responsible for their actions when they commit sexual abuse but that the number of children harmed could be reduced if society had more empathy and understanding for paedophiles. To be clear my use of paedophile within this is someone who is sexually attracted to those below the age of consent in its different forms. A sex offender within this post is someone who has acted upon these desires in a wholly unacceptable manner. So when I say empathy and understanding for paedophiles this does not extend to the actions a percentage of them commit. Whether paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder or a distorted sexual orientation does not matter, what matters is this is something I would not wish on my worst enemy. To have a sexual desire for something so opposed to anything that society can or will accept and that without breaking human morality fundamentally to ever follow it through is among the worst things I could imagine having. There is no cure currently accepted and only therapies with limited results which can have very serious side affects.\nMany may also have other mental conditions which make self control and life even harder. \n\nSo this group is automatically condemned by society for being who they are without any choice in the matter, the sexual desire is not a choice, any action is but the state of being a paedophile is not. In the UK just by saying you have desires for children and wish to receive help you are placed on a register and this will seriously affect employment prospects and if anyone you know finds out you will be shunned and be isolated. Within this isolation of having no one to talk to, no one who can provide support or help to control their desires I am not surprised a percentage commit unspeakable acts. A large number of these have the additional mental conditions which in many cases will make it harder for them to distinguish from right and wrong. \n\nI do not expect society to embrace them, but by shunning and pre condemning them society drives paedophiles away from help, into the corners and dark places. To live lies to protect themselves and only makes negative outcomes more likely. I am not certain the precise way to make this happen or how it would work but we need to start thinking about paedophiles as people with a condition and not monsters in the night. \n\nWith all of this I understand why people feel about it they way they do, from the heart without rationality. To any victim or family of a victim I can't imagine the pain, but what I want is the least number of children affected and condemning things and keeping them in the dark is almost always the worst way to achieve a desired outcome.\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2awie8\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

CMV\n\nComment: Many people have marveled at how time appears to operate as a line.  The present is much like a point on that line.  Geometry defines any given point on that line as being immeasurably small, and yet the line is somehow made up entirely of these immeasurably small points.  Even though this seems paradoxical, when we experience time we are experiencing this exact model.  How long is the present?  It's immeasurably small.  Yet time seems to be made up of a never ending string of these present moments.  In other words, you know you're in the present now as you read this, but you couldn't possibly say how many present moments have passed since you started reading.\n\nFollow me so far?  I promise I'm going somewhere with this.\n\nThe next thing to keep in mind is that we only experience the present.  We have memories, of course, but those memories aren't you actually experiencing the past but rather they are thoughts presently stored in your brain.  Much like if I open a five year-old file on my computer, I'm not actually experiencing five years into my past.  Everybody's experience of the universe is strictly limited to the present.\n\nNext, recall that in order to define a line, you need exactly to know exactly two points.  Through any single point, there are an infinite number of lines.  Ah, now we begin to see the problem.  Determinism says that time is one fixed line that is fated to happen, yet we only experience one point, the present.  How can any of us say that there is only one past or one present, if we can only experience one point on the line?\n\nThe combined work of Newton, Faraday, and other early scientists seemed to have solved this problem.  Eventually, science came to believe in a very mechanical view of the universe.  All objects acted in by a predictable set of rules.  What happens in the present appeared to be an unalterable outcome of the past.  If you know the velocity and acceleration of a cannonball in the present you can calculate its velocity and acceleration before and after the present.\n\nEssentially, once someone learns about Newtonian physics it's easy to conclude that if we could somehow know everything about the present, it would be theoretically possible with calculation to determine everything about the past and the future as well.  Even if this is actually impossible for a real person, the theoretical possibility proves that the mere existence of the present implies one and only one fixed line.  In other words, you know there's a definitive second point out there to define the timeline.\n\nBut then Godel came along, and his Incompleteness Theorem gave mathematical proof that it is logically impossible to know everything about a closed system.  Suddenly the idea that 'if we knew everything about the present we could know everything about the future or past' loses a lot of value because it's logically impossible to know everything about the present.\n\nNext came Einstein's theories.  He showed that two different observers can have contradictory experiences of the universe.  For instance, imagine a guy at the back of a dark train who turns on a flashlight.  Now imagine there's a second person watching from outside the train.  According to Einstein's relativity, the light will hit the front of the train for the guy in the train sooner in time than for the guy outside of the train.  In other words, the deterministic theory that there is only one singular timeline hit another major blow.\n\nFinally, there came quantum physics.  Hizenberg's Uncertainty Principle, crudely stated, shows that it is impossible to know a subatomic particle's position and velocity at the same time.  Where Godel proved theoretically that we couldn't know everything about the present, quantum physics showed there are an uncountable number of real world examples.\n\nTo summarize, determinism requires that time be considered one singular defined line.  However, all we ever know of time is one point, which is not enough to define a singular line.  Ever since a Newtonian/mechanical view of the world has been disproven, we have no choice but to abandon the idea that time is one fixed line.  As it's impossible to complete know the present, there will always be an infinite possibilities of potential futures (and pasts).  Since there are many possible futures, determinism is false.\n\nAuthor: t3_1i25nw\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

While it's arguable he shared the spotlight with Hugo Strange and Bane in Arkham City and Arkham: Origins, respectively, both games ended with Batman confronting the Joker. In all three games Joker consistently outsmarted and in some cases outmuscled various other super-villains-- most notably Black Mask who was completely made a fool of and his threat totally neutered. \n\n In the popular and acclaimed Scott Synder/Greg Capullo on-going comic book series Joker used Two-Face, Riddler, and Penguin in one of his schemes and then captured them in a cage and left them for the police. In the most recent issue, spoilers ahead, Batman had to ask for the assistance of several other members of his rogue's gallery (including Scarecrow, Mr. Freeze, and Bane) to defeat Joker. \n\n In the Brian Azzarello's \"Joker\" graphic novel Joker humiliates and press gangs Penguin into laundering him money. Later he forces Two-Face to seek Batman's help because the former is scared for his life after Joker murdered his gang. \n\n Famously, Joker also displayed immunity to Scarecrow's fear toxin. When the Scarecrow attempted to poison him the Joker literally laughed in his face and beat him nearly to death with a chair. \n\n These are just a few examples off the top of my head. As my cmv title says, I think portraying the Joker like this, making him look cool at the expense of the rest of Batman's rogues gallery, diminishes and marginalizes the rest of Batman's rogues gallery to the detriment of Batman's mythology overall and the other stories writers and creators can tell. \n\n When Joker is always the scariest, the most deranged, the most in control, the most out of control, the slickest, and the coolest why should I read about Batman's other adventures against people who are *less than*? If Batman beat Joker we know he can beat Two-Face. If he survived Joker's mind games we know he can survive Scarecrow's fear toxin. If he got out Joker's death trap we know he can get out of the Riddler's too. How much better would Batman's Universe be if when, say, Two-Face was revealed in the first issue as the bad guy for a particular arc it was immediately an \"oh, shit\" moment rather than a \"well, let's see what this writer has in mind\" moment?\n\n Needless to say, I think the Joker is being Captain Jack Sparrow-d. I think Joker is being Wolverine-d.

However, I've learned over time that if something has been a smash hit the world over, it probably caters to too many different interests, and as a result is less interesting to me than it could have been. My main point here is that I feel this argument applies to everyone.\n\n**TL;DR:** If something appeals to everyone, it fails to completely satisfy each person's interests when lesser known, more esoteric content could.\n\nAuthor: t3_2vhhar\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

What was it attempting to do?\n\n2. Did it succeed in doing that?\n\nNow there's plenty of room for squabbling the details (what if a piece of art succeeds wildly in a category it wasn't aiming for?) the general idea is fairly well applicable, and the difference between \"good\" and \"bad\" becomes more clear when there are more examples to compare to.\n\nTake someone learning to play the violin, for example. If a newcomer were to rake the bow across the strings in an awkward attempt at *'Ode to Joy'*, I do not believe their attempt can be considered as \"equal\" to that of a virtuoso. I believe that one's performance is objectively better than the other.\n\nI believe this can be applied very well in structured forms of art. An episode of a television series, for example, provides a very clear image of a \"good episode\" and a \"bad episode\" and while there's obviously a lot of room for personal taste there are some things that can be near-universally understood as \"bad acting\", \"bad writing\", or \"bad cinematography\".\n\n\nAuthor: t3_1cnl02\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

In my life, I've worked jobs in several fields doing retail, tutoring, tech support and fast food. These jobs had a pretty wide base of people of various income levels and intelligence.  While I started working I had the pre-conceived stereotypes of the dumb jock and ditzy sorority sister. Working in retail and technical support I saw increasingly that the customers who got angriest and most frustrated at simple things tended to be less attractive. The same thing happened for tutoring later in college. A lot of students came for tutoring but it was the less attractive ones that seemed to really struggle. While it\u2019s pretty easy to accuse me of confirmation bias I want to stress that my bias flipped directions based on personal observations. I also believe I\u2019m  a somewhat unattractive guy who\u2019s a slower learner then a lot of people so I\u2019m really not doing my ego any favors holding this view either. \n\n\nMy conclusion is that social Darwinism, despite it being used to justify classism and racism, has had a measurable effect.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to believe that intelligence would be used to find more attractive mates. Also intelligence would lead to a better chance at wealth and power and in polygamist societies it would mean intelligent males would have a higher chance to have more children with multiple females. While In a monogamist society, someone who is both smart and attractive would be more likely to find a mate who is also smart and attractive. \n\n\nFinally, a quick internet search on the subject returned this paper stating: \u201cIn the United Kingdom, attractive children are more intelligent by 12.4 IQ points(r= .381), whereas in the United States, the correlation between intelligence and physical attractiveness is somewhat smaller (r=.126)\u201d\nhttp://personal.lse.ac.uk/kanazawa/pdfs/I2011.pdf\n\n\nJust a disclaimer so I don\u2019t sound like a total ass, I\u2019d like to stress that I generally try not to judge people by looks as much as I used to.  Anyone can be a genius or moron when you get to know them but I simply believe there is a statistically significant amount of people of attractive people who are smarter.  I\u2019m open to this view changing since it does feel unfair but right now if I have to make a snap judgment of someone  I see no reason not to choose the more attractive person. \n\nAuthor: t3_1k8fe0\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

I was eating too big of bites. She said I needed to savor it. \n\nThere are apparently a large number of ways you could do this. Almost all of these involve eating slow so lets get that out of the way. The standard way would be to just bite straight in and have a nice amount of the chocolate enriched outer segment and the peanut butter segment. Nice and balanced. And alternative way to eat a Reece's would be to eat around the edge and to then eat the center as a finale. I could see this working for peanut butter lovers or chocolate lovers equally well it would just depend on whether you want to have your favorite portion at the end. Alternatively you can pop the center out, eat it, and then eat the rim. You could split the reece's in half, eat the center part of one half, the rim of that half and then repeat for the other half. \n\nThese all have their pros and cons but the one thing they have in common is that allow you to fine tune your eating experience to match your preferences. So for every way of eating a reece's theres a personality type that is well suited to that method. Since there is a bunch of different personality types, there are a bunch of right ways to eat a reece's and arguably no wrong way to eat one.\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2sk852\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

I rode the same busses to work that they have targeted in the past, and was thankful to not feel like I was in too dangerous a position.\n\nRegarding the settlements, they were started on land Israel justly received when it won the 1967 6-Day War. Had the Arabs not declared aggressive war on Israel, they would still have it. Most of the land is in the West Bank (of the Jordan River) that used to belong to Jordan, but was lost by it because it was one of the countries that launched an unprovoked attack that year on Israel. There was never any \"border\" after the 6-Day War, only an armistice line and Israel was not obliged to stay there or honor it. When you launch an aggressive war and then lose, you can't complain if you lose land, but the Israel's enemies don't see it that way, and have used every tool in their arsenal, including money, to get rid of Israel and obtain the land. Israel, faced with a massive military invasion, not once but several times, needed depth and created settlements decades ago for this purpose and also to have a place to locate its growing population.\n\nCMV\n\nAuthor: t3_1woay8\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

I seriously mean this. Knock some fucking sense into me because right now this view that I'm about to describe is ingrained into me from several years of negativity and I want it turned around and gone from my head if it's a wrong view. I'm not sure if this sub can do that but I thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nBasically I've grown up to unfortunately be a foreveralone. My current situation is I'm a 22 year old male and still am a kissless, foreveralone virgin.\n\nFrom around 17 years of age, I've been put into nearly all-male schools. First it was a fucking applied math school in the states, and this was chosen by my parents (terrible choice really). We had about 10 girls to every 50 guys or so.\n\nBecause I hated the school so much, I decided to leave it, but by some miracle of absolute retardation I though that choosing to study programming next was a good idea. Needless to say, the school I ended up in next (and I am still currently in) was a school to study Computer Science. The ratio here was about 5 girls to 100 guys.\n\nNow meanwhile growing up, all I saw around me was all kinds of guys (Jocks, even nerds, even neckbeards, skinny or tall or fat you name it) getting into relationships and falling in love. But (and I went out of my way to ask as many acquantances who I knew) each couple that I asked said that they met the usual \"Ah we had 35 classes together in high school and it just happened\" or the \"Ah we had the same major in college and it just happened.\n\nHell if you go on some random internet forum, like the bb.misc you see heaps of threads on there like \"my gf of 5 years just left me, devastated me because we've shared everything for 5 years, our life and school and classes etc\".\n\nMy facebook is filled with high school sweethearts or ppl who just met in college (via same major or at least via friends).\n\n\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that from what I've seen, esp ages 15-25, people seem to fall into relationships from their immediate social circle. And because of my parents retarded choices and later my even more stupider choices, I feel like I stripped myself of any chance to get into a relationship because my entire life I've had social circles that consisted of all males, friends who were either completely nerds or who had zero female acquantances/friends. I've actually never in my LIFE had a single female \"friend\" either and I highly doubt this is my fault. I just literally meet zero females a yeare due to poor fucking life choices.\n\nIn addition to all of this due to all this negativity and what I perceive and think as lack of opportunity, I somehow developed a worldview where I can't imagine how a female who already has several dozens of guys in her immediate social circle would ever go for a guy who is a stranger to her. \n\nFor example, I'm referring to pickup. Let's say you try picking up a girl on the street but she is a total stranger. You approach be as uncreepy as you possibly can and you try to go for some form of contact. She might even give it to you, but why would she ever in her right fucking mind ever truly want anything to do with you when she has a real social circle with tons of males she already knows and trusts and she can just choose from them.\n\nSame with rarely meeting extra curricular classes. I actually took dance classes (salsa) for 2 years just so I could meet women, and I found that since we only meet once a week (hardly can be considered immediate social circle) none of them were even remotely interested. As a matter of fact despite trying several times to start conversations with them, none of them had the time nor interest to even talk after dance was over.\n\nSo all of these experiences made me extremely bitter and feeling left out and feel like I never have a fucking chance in hell of ever finding anyone. Because of this mindset I have refrained from trying online dating or trying to get into pickup (to be fair I did try to get into this but gave up quite early).\n\nI'm sorry for the wall of text and I hope this doesn't get downvoted. I'll gladly hear any stories to defy my sad theories or some advice on how to break my negative mind cycle...\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_27my6e\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

Or perhaps a better way of putting it would be to say that they believe an atheist-run world would be a less oppressive world. I believe this not to be necessarily true. Looking outside of the West, we can see that the religious have historically been brutally persecuted by atheists in Communist countries like China, North Korea, and the former Soviet Union (which incidentally, are among the only countries in human history run by aggressive, militant atheists). We can even see the beginnings of it today in certain European countries who persecute religious people for preaching their faith, or daring to homeschool their children in contravention of the nation's laws mandating secular State education. Point being, it's a simple matter of which groups hold power and which do not, and IMO it is by mere virtue of the fact that the religious have historically held power for much longer than atheists that there are more atrocities attributable to organized religion than there are attributed to \"evangelical\" atheism. Too often, people conflate the evils inherent to all forms of human collectivism, tribalism and totalitarian leadership with the traits of specific groups or leaders.

An optimistic person who has high expectations which can may be unrealistic is bound to fail to meet these expectations and thus is more likely to feel sorrowful as a result. In comparison having a pessimistic view means you are less likely to be disappointed and any success you get will be a pleasant surprise. Thus you are less likely to be sad or dejected with this mindset. Think about it if I go in a race with low expectations in comparison to going in expecting to destroy everyone I much less likely to be sad if I do fail. Optimism seems to be just setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\nFurther more optimism seems to reduce the joy of actually succeeding.

I'm really just a normal guy, most people would say 'straight-acting' although I hate what that phrase means so much lol. The way I see it, there are struggles with your **sexuality**, and then there are struggles with your **gender identity**.\n\nI don't understand why the T is in LGBT - because trans people are often outcasts like other 'non-heteros' such as myself? To the majority of transexuals, they ARE straight and their body simply doesn't reflect that! If sexuality is associated with gender identity, then it can be retroactively implied that gay men are actually fantasizing about being women on the inside - which is *ridiculously* wrong.\n\nI'm not saying that there's anything bad about trans people, that they should be excluded from things like pride or segregated in any way. I'm a huge sympathizer, in the sense that if I was THIS confused about my own sexuality before, I couldn't even begin to imagine the pain a person might feel if they were a different gender on the inside than they were on the outside. \n\nIt's in a class of its own, and little do most people realise that it's a completely different thing from transvestites/cross dressing. When uneducated people think 'gay', they jump to an image of some bulky dude dressed in drag on a cheap karaoke stage. None of this applies to sexuality in any way, and having all trans things in the same group as LGBT is causing more confusion when we should be fighting our separate battles for acceptance and equality.\n\nI'll say it again, to really *stress* this point: **Sexuality =/= Gender Identity**. Linking the two would be like putting pizza in the burger section of the menu - it just doesn't fit in with the section's whole point.

Specifically, Arby's series of **\"We have the meats!\"** commercials ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCOwU_MxrtY)). For those unfamiliar, in this series of commercials, a deep-voiced man shouts at the audience through the duration of the commercial, getting louder as he goes, ending with Arby's current slogan of, \"We have the meats!\" It is loud; it is obnoxious; one gets the impression that the belligerent shouter's next move would be to slam the viewer's head into a table of meats, forcing them to eat whether they want to or not. For vegans and vegetarians, there may be a further degree of moral offense at the suggestion they be required to consume meats.\n\nI think businesses like Arby's should refrain from putting up commercials like this because:\n\n* They have an aggressive tone, suggestive of imminent physical conflict, which can be stressful to some viewers.\n* They are excessively loud, which requires temporarily muting or turning down the TV's volume.\n* They belittle the sensibilities of vegans and vegetarians who may happen to be watching.\n* Business-wise, they dissuade potential customers by building negative associations with the brand.\n\nI don't watch much TV these days, but these are probably some of the most obnoxious commercials I can recall seeing for a long time.\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2rcby9\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

There does not have to be an abysmal depth for the heights of a pyramid to exist. The fact that our distant ancestors agreed to place value into worthless pieces of paper to the end of coexisting peacefully does not mean that we must be bound to the exact same archaic system established centuries ago. So many of the rich are under the impression that they alone earned the money they have, well, who allowed them to accumulate all this cash? The people, everyone collectively consuming goods and services allow the so called elite to rise above. What the hell does a billionaire need that much money for? At that point it can really only be used to accumulate even more gems and baubles into their proverbial mountain of gold; allowing them to sit on top of it masturbating their ego. Furthermore, when anyone brings up the fact that we can redistribute this wealth with little to no effect on the wealthy and a drastic positive effect on the poor everyone screams about \u201chandouts\u201d to druggie hippie homeless rapist murderers that somewhere along the process of losing any notable property also lost their status as human beings. Pegged as leeches upon society and blamed for institutional shortcomings, the excessively poor are completely trapped between a lack of economic capital and a stigmatized existence as worthless. When presented with this opinion of the poor and destitute, I simply say why don\u2019t we just kill them then? With near 100% occurrence people are appalled by this notion because everyone is on the same page when it comes to everyone having the right to live. The fact that life is seen as an intrinsic right, yet the basic necessities for life are viewed as something that must be worked for is a disgusting contradiction pervasive throughout human society. While many economic models such as universal basic income and negative income taxes propose a feasible way to eliminate poverty in a given society, they will never be ratified because those with the power to do so only hold onto their power through maintaining the status quo.\n\nI hope this can spur some discussion :)\n\nFood: Already we have an incredibly small % of the population involved in agriculture (~2% I believe) and they provide more than enough crops to feed everyone and create countless biochemical products as well. It's not far fetched to assume that less and less man hours will be able to feed more and more people moving into the future. So a few people running a predominantly automated farm can feed thousands even millions of people. Meaning, that the food is available to sustain everyone without them directly working in agriculture.\n\nShelter: This is a bit more convoluted, what is the motivation to build housing to give away for free? Well in a UBI system, which i believe is one of the few feasible ways to turn this idea into policy they would still be getting paid rent for their buildings.

Sending the child to school does not absolve them of that responsibility, and does not transfer that responsibility to the school.\n\nThe most common argument I have heard is that children are required to go to school, and therefore the school is acting as a \"parent\" for those eight hours and is responsible for providing for the students' needs during that time. I don't find that argument reasonable for two reasons. The first is that the school is not responsible for providing any other consumable goods to the students (pencil, paper, clothing, etc.) and it is unreasonable to arbitrarily assign the responsibility of nutrition to them. Secondly, if the child was not at school, the parent would be responsible for providing lunch. The need for lunch is not caused in any way by the student being in school, and I cannot understand why the parent would be absolved of this responsibility due to a change in venue.\n\nPlease note, my argument does not include parents who provide lunch for their children by signing up for the free/reduced lunch program, as I feel this adequately fulfilled their responsibility.\n\nPlease help me, as I can't help but feel all the people who argue for free lunches for all students are a bit off their rockers.

First, they are tall and top heavy. This makes them easier to knock over and spill than ordinary glasses. While their wider base alleviates this a bit, they have the additional problem of being very easy to break, so that if they do fall over, there is a good chance that they will shatter, leaving a mess that is difficult and potentially harmful to clean. On the subject of cleaning, their shape makes them difficult to clean and their fragility makes them difficult to clean well. You cannot get your hand inside them to apply pressure to certain stains, and even if you could, you still can't apply the pressure needed to clean some stains without risking breaking the glass. Furthermore, the stem of the glass is also brittle and serves no practical purpose.

My viewpoint is probably less unpopular here than it is with the general public. That said, the media, and most people IRL, seem to hold the belief that anonymity is dangerous, for kids and teens in particular, because bullies and mean people can hide behind their words without having to face any consequences.  Anonymity is treated like bad words, or weird pornography\u2014people respect its right to exist, but they don't think it has any place in kids\u2019, teens\u2019, or for that matter, any normal people\u2019s lives.\n\nIn short, I think this is bullshit, in a couple layers.  For one, the idea that society keeps people in check by imposing consequences for saying hurtful things strikes me as deeply flawed.  It seems to be the same system that ostracizes \u201cdifferent\u201d or \u201cweird\u201d people.  Society operates under a hierarchy: the greater status you have, the more weight your words carry.  Thus, someone higher up the food chain can get away with saying or doing almost anything to someone lower down the food chain, facing little consequence.  In my experience, bullying is usually the result of the bully using their greater power to prevent the bullied from fighting back.\n\nI also believe that the way to combat these issues isn't to hide the internet from kids, or convert it into an extension of society.  I think parents and schools should educate them about the internet. And I mean actually educate them about it, not just say \u201cthe internet is scary, stay away from it\u201d.  Because telling them to avoid it isn't going to work, and without understanding how to deal with it, kids are going to treat it the same way they do real life.\n\nThe reason I care about this issue is that I actually think there is some serious good that can come out of anonymity for kids.  The internet is a great place for temporary escape from a difficult real life, and anonymity is an equalizer.  Some people would like to think that people with greater status have all earned it, and outcasts deserve it, but that often isn't the case.  Anonymity allows kids who are different, who wouldn't otherwise get their voice heard, to have the same playing field as more popular, confident, higher status kids.  And I don't think it's right to ignore that.\n\nI don't get to talk about these kinds of issues with many people I know in real life, so I am genuinely interested in any alternate viewpoints.  I'm just tired of hearing the same assumptions, and certain points not addressed.\n\nAuthor: t3_1smktm\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

That really is complex. /s\n\nI just don't understand why this unhealthy behavior deserves any more \"hate\" than any other unhealthy choice.

The struggle has two sides:\n\n1) Transgender is a mental illness and moving towards a society where we support transitioning is tantamount to supporting schizophrenic delusions.\n\n2) That's exactly what they said about homosexuality, and a viewpoint like this could lead to long-lasting harm to individuals who could live a perfectly normal fulfilling life.\n\nThe hard evidence that backs up my feelings is that there's a fairly minimal change in suicide rates no matter whether gender-reassignment has happened, and no matter how they report to feel about their own life.

However, a so-called \"share\" doesn't carry the responsibility that it should. When someone buys stock in a company, they theoretically have a small say in that companies operations, while at the same time having little to no responsibility for that companies success or failure. Perhaps I'm merely misunderstanding the function of a share, but it appears to me that shares allow people to reap all the benefits of \"owning\" a company, without carrying any of the risks that true ownership should entail. No-one but the majority shareholders actually contribute to a companies decisions, even though every shareholder technically has a vote they could be using.\n\nIf it can be shown that a stock market is necessary for a thriving economy, then I'll concede that it's merely a \"necessary evil,\" like death or taxes. I think theoretically an economy without a stock market could work, but I don't know enough about economics. \n\nThe main issue is the lack of responsbility and authority that shares should carry. In short, value is added to an economy through work. Since share holders do little to no work, their trading and investing add little to no total value to the economy. I'll admit I don't know as much as I should about this to have a legitimate opinion, but if someone could explain why I'm wrong about this I'd be extremely grateful.\n\n----\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_23dzpq\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

If you are a moderate voter, maybe that could sway you. Maybe. More likely, you will, as everyone else does, be skeptical of campaign ads. This is especially true if you aren't a moderate. It gives you more visibility, but 99.999% of the time you aren't going to change anyone's mind. \n\nMoney doesn't buy elections. At the end of the day your vote is all that matters, and how influenced is your vote likely to be by smear ads?\n\nOn the other hand, most people look to the few major news sources (CNN, MSNBC, Fox) for their actual information when it comes to campaigns and making decisions. People seek out news that agrees with them and are then fed selective soundbites that influence their view of a candidate. If you're conservative, you go to Fox, if you are liberal, you go pretty much anywhere else. People tend to be less skeptical of their news sources just because it is the news.\n\nNow hopefully I don't need to explain why this is bad. Obviously the majority of news sources are bias, and there is a plethora of instances of false reporting.\n\nWhy do people get so upset about Citizens United? I feel as though more than anything it is a scapegoat for people opposed to republicans and corporations. I don't feel as though reversing it will prompt any real change. I also don't feel like those opposed to it realize that there are plenty of motives that are likely to be held by democrats that aren't any more justifiable than republicans. Democratic candidates get most of their funding from unions, which, as far as I understand, aren't corporations and would still be allowed to donate (could be wrong). If that's true, it seems like one could easily argue that its a political power play to cut Republican campaign funding.

In other words, I don't think a song should have 1 verse then repeat the chorus ad nauseam. \n\n* **Originality:** A song/artist/album should have some semblance of originality when compared to other artists in their genre.\n\nI believe that all popular genres have at least some of these qualities (and I'm sure I've left out some other qualities of good music) and that 90's grunge does not. It does not have interesting instrumentals in that they all give essentially the same sound and are not difficult to play from what I have heard. The beat, if there ever is one, is slow, monotonous, and basically always the same. The lyrics of every song I know from that genre are very boring, they are not deep in any way nor are they intellectually/emotionally stimulating. I hear people talk about how Cobain's lyrics are all so great but they all seem very shallow. The songs are not complex since they are often repetitive and both structurally and sound-wise. Finally, in my opinion they are not original from one another either since they all have basically the same sound and pseudo-deepness. \n\nI would like to make a disclaimer that I am not extremely well versed in the genre, but have heard my fair share of songs and have not liked any of them. I also do not country or rap, but they fall into some of the categories listed above and I can see how some people would find that type of sound/style appealing.\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2fegtd\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

See: Female character model controversies, Mirrors Edge 2, Assassins Creed, etc.\n\n2) Jobs dominated by men (engineering, blue collar jobs, etc.) are being encouraged more and more for females to join. At the same time society is essentially calling these jobs/companies sexist because of the low percentages of women which has resulted in lots of companies pushing hard for more women in the work place.\n\n3) Domestic shelters are dominated in numbers by women with few shelters being available for men. \n\n4) Websites on the internet, like reddit, have the communities called sexist all the time and even now we are seeing a constant push towards making reddit more female friendly (see: twoxchromosomes becoming a default subreddit) and pushing aside the male demographic.\n\nAnyway, the result of all of this is I think that men essentially have limited/no avenues for places to talk to other men, where as women have a plethora of places that they can go to.

The view states that it is *good* that cultures abide by their idiosyncratic definition of the good.  Proponents of normative cultural relativism would also tend to hostility to those who would impose one set of cultural valuations on another culture.\n\nThis view is problematic for several reasons.  Firstly, it treats all change as being wrong, but then right as that change becomes established and institutionalised within a culture.\n\nTake for instance the position of women in society- for the longest time, women had no political representation and very little in the way of codified rights.  What would a relativist have to say about such a state of affairs?  Nothing, of course, except to convey a blithe sense of pluralistic approval.   However, English moral philosophers (particularly of utilitarian bent) like Bentham and Mill argued from their principles that women deserve political representation and rights **a hundred years in anticipation of feminism**.  The relativist is bound to decrying this moral foresight as lunacy on part of those that first conceived of it, or as a wicked sort of moral perversion.  If the culture is always right, morality is mob rule.\n\nFurther, the intuition that we should live and let live, abstaining from enforcing our beliefs and will on other cultures is self-defeating within the context of cultural relativism.  What if my culture approves of violent and exploitative colonialism?  It does not follow from the view that all culture's ethical beliefs are \"right for them\" that the violent imposition of my own cultural values is wrong.  Further, it would seem to state that my culture (or at least its attitude to colonialism) actually is wrong in some objective sense.  This is a completely arbitrary specification.\n\nWe can be moral realists whilst taking into account cultural differences.  If in culture A, dying one's hair purple is grievously hurtful to a lot of people but in culture B it is not, then that behaviour assumes a different moral importance relative to culture.  But this leaves room for moral realism and ethical systems like consequentialism without arbitrarily asserting the ethical supremacy of culture. \n\nAuthor: t3_2mbv93\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

This is about the same price for an entree in a pub/chain eatery/sports bar (at least where I'm from).

The overhead of food trucks is FAR less than a restaurant. A restaurant pays for a piece of real estate, air conditioning, interior seating, and more. Some Googling tells me that a food truck business can be started for as little as $40,000, up to $250,000, which is still far less than a Chili's-size restaurant would cost to start up. \n\n2.

So I am a firm believer in cultural relativism, that you can not judge a culture base off of morals or societal norms you gained from your own culture. So we have example one, that being gay is okay because we have seen it throughout history in many different cultures, the Greeks being a prime example. However they also were constant offenders of pedophilia, forcing twelve year old boys to give oral sex to grown men. We bring up pacific island cultures, that idolize drag queens and transgenders, however there are also cultures where the women teach the 9 year old boys how to have sex. How can the first be okay but not the second. They are both acceptable in their respective cultures just one is deemed disgusting in our culture. We bring up animals, point out how so many different species have gay relationships, but animals also start having sex as soon as they are able to produce babies, which is like twelve for us. Being gay is natural, being a pedophile is natural, we see both through out history and across species lines. Neither are the \"norm\" but are widely accepted in many cultures. However, westernized cultures have deemed sex with children to be wrong. I ask a westerner what they think about pedophilia they say its disgusting. Its the same when I ask a homophobic Christians what they think about gay people, they say it's disgusting. Both are view points that have been instilled in those people through their culture. Since it is widely accepted that pedophilia is bad, I feel like the gay community gets defensive and tries to distant themselves for pedophilia, when in truth they are very much alike. \n\nBefore I get all the messages of being homophobic or being a child molester, I figured I'd state my views.

This system leads to swing states, which hold disproportional power over the elections compared to their actual population. A way to remedy this is to change the way the votes are given out. This is the percentage-based system:\n\nLet's say that State A is traditionally Republican/Democrat with a consistent 75% majority. The electoral votes can be easily predicted to go to one party. But under my system the minority party would receive 25% of the electoral votes. \n\nA couple of effects would occur from this:\n\nPoliticians would have to campaign in every state in order to consolidate their votes, \"diluting\" the amount of money they bring to the elections. \n\nThe amount of \"wasted\" votes is minimized. If State A goes Republican/Democrat, then all of those who vote for the minority accomplished nothing under winner-take-all.\n\nAs a *possible* effect: Voter turnout increases. If people know that they don't have to beat the majority anymore, they might vote more.\n\nNegative effects:\n\nSince the amount of money entering politics is diluted, the amount of money that needs to be raised for any politician to run is significantly higher. However, I believe that since the amount of money has already reached incredibly high levels (Almost $1b spent by each party), this bar already exists. \n\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_306yu2\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

CMV.\n\nComment: It is my position that Feminism is an example of *slave morality*, and that as such can only serve to empower women in direct proportion to the amount of actual gender-based oppression they experience, and that in the absence of a strong, coherent and concrete male master class, the inherent re-sentiment of feminism is incapable of empowering anyone.\n\nWhat I mean is that as a society approaches equality, the tools feminism provides for the empowerment of women become increasingly less useful and ineffective.  I would argue that we have already reached and passed the point in history (at least in the West) at which feminisms diminishing returns become overwhelmed by the inherent limiting nature of slave morality.\n\nSlave morality is fundamentally disempowering because slave morality makes no allowances for the possibility of a person to act on their own agency and exercise their will to power.  Slave morality, but its nature, must necessarily condemn agency and the will to power, as these are the hallmarks of the Master class, and the primary purpose of slave morality is to demonize the Master class.\n\nThus feminism has no concept of healthy masculinity, seeing masculinity as only a symptom of the Master and thus seeing all hallmarks of masculinity as oppressive.  This is highly problematic, since traditional masculinity is a form of master morality intended to prepare boys for their potential roles as leaders of men.\n\nThus, traditional masculinity places extreme emphasis on personal responsibility for one's actions, honor as an assurance of good faith and trustworthiness, and stoicism in the face of hardship and pain.  The man who whines constantly about his disadvantages, blames others for his failures, and insists on being rewarded and praised for existing is defined by traditional masculinity as a loser, as not really a man.\n\nA generation of women who came of age in a time when legal and social barriers made it impossible for women to excel developed feminism as a critique and deconstruction of traditional masculine gender bias, and launched a widespread series of social changes that resulted in full legal equality for women.  The generation that followed them was raised, male and female alike, with a belief in social equality.\nYet, women do not yet posses equality of *outcomes* with men.  Men are still more likely to hold political power and economic power.  Why is this?  My suggestion is that it is due largely to feminism, which has failed to adjust its central premises in the face of the end of institutional inequality.\n\nWhy are there fewer women in political office than men?  Recent studies have shown little evidence of gender bias amongst voters, and the problem seems to largely come down to one single factor:  **Women just don't run for office very often.**  In fact, if women had won every single race they participated in during the 2012 elections (which they very nearly did), the make-up of the government would still have been overwhelmingly male.\n\nThe traditional feminism response is to seek out blame and find an oppressive force working against women, except there isn't anything there to find.  What's lacking is encouragement to women to seek power.  Something which, not surprisingly, is fundamentally at odds with the worldviews that feminism derives from, in which seeking power is Master morality and inherently anti-feminist.\n\nThus, strangely, we see some unusual trends in society.  For example, Republican women candidates are, [according to surveys](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/11/25/why-did-women-do-so-well-in-2012-because-gender-bias-is-declining/), seen as more competent and more qualified as leaders than Democratic women.  I would suggest this is due to the fact that Republican women tend to reject the *Woman As Victim, Male As Victimizer* model of feminism, and instead see themselves as true equals of men -- every bit as capable of acting on their ambitions and pursuing their will to power as men are. Meanwhile, Democratic women are more likely to embrace feminism and portray women as victims of society, which in turn makes them seem less powerful (as powerful people do not see themselves as victims).\n\nThus it is my position that modern women, faced with the reality of political and social equality, will never gain equality of outcomes unless they abandon feminism.  So long as they rail against an oppressive state that no longer exists, they cannot truly empower women.  Instead, they can only turn their energies towards more and more frivilous and meaningless displays of \"oppression.\"\n\nThis is most vividly seen in the blogs of \"Tumblr feminists\" -- young women who, rather than embracing the tremendous freedoms they have and seeking to make meaningful careers for themselves, instead assign themselves to perpetual victimhood.  They make charting their own victimization, mapping the intersections of their oppression, their primary hobby.  Rather than empower themselves, they scream at the world \"Why won't you empower me!!!\"\n\nAnd no wonder, when the philosophy they embrace defines being a victim as the highest good.  People seek to be good, and if you teach them that being good is being a victim, they will devote their energies not to improving their own standing and achieving their dreams, but rather to proving that they are, in fact, a victim.  This leads only to \"oppression olympics,\" where different historical out-groups fight amongst themselves over who is the most oppressed, and meanwhile the straight, white men they villify continue to run the world -- because those straight, white men are the only ones actually expressing any interest in running it.\n\nThe modern feminist engages constantly in pointless, aggravating and irritating actions that only serve to make feminism increasingly irrelevant.  Examples would include silly, incomprehensible and pointless forms of protest such as \"Slut Walks,\" [censorship campaigns](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/12/robin-thicke-blurred-lines-banned-another-university) to ban Robin  Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\" (a song that literally has *nothing* to do with rape), and [idiotic complaints](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/feminists-protest-life-size-barbie-dreamhouse-berlin-article-1.1346327) about Barbie (quite possibly the most empowered fictional woman to ever exist).\nI don't expect this to change any time soon, nor do I expect women to make any significant advances as a class, until the slave-morality of feminism is set aside and a new philosophy, a philosophy of the *Uberfrau*, develops to take its place.\n\nBut please, feel free to Change My View.\n\nAuthor: t3_1u9vif\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

Of course this is the internet and I have used a semi-private username, so it is easier for me to say this. The reason why I\u2019m not completely open about reading the book made me reflect on the reasons for why I am ashamed about reading this book\n\n\nThe reason for this is that Fifty Shades of Grey is more than just about sex. It\u2019s about relationship violence, manipulation, and the sexual objectification of women. The book is a source of romantic fantasy for women, but the key word is \u201cunrealistic\u201d fantasy. If you are familiar with the story, you know that Anastasia, the main character, and Christian Grey fall in love and she is the one to \u201cchange him.\u201d It\u2019s almost a sexual and abusive version of Beauty and the Beast, one of my favorite Disney movies. My concern is that women read Fifty Shades of Grey and get nothing but negative messages from it. These messages tell them that they can change an abusive relationship, they are to appeal to the man\u2019s eye, and that it is okay to objectify your body for the sexual pleasure of men. I want more opinions about this, because to me I am a hypocrite for buying the book.\n\n\nConclusion: I am not a hypocrite for buying and reading the book while disagreeing with the content. I think it\u2019s important for me to express how I feel about the book, but in the end Fifty Shades of Grey was meant for entertainment. I didn\u2019t enjoy the BDSM theme of the book and can\u2019t relate to that sort of \u201cpleasure,\u201d therefore I am already bias to the book and I can\u2019t understand this appeal. I think the fact that the actions were consensual in the book don\u2019t an abusive relationship because it was about submissives, so the characters are not \u201cencouraging\u201d this type of relationship for everyone. It was my choice to read the book, and now it\u2019s my choice to give my own review. I may feel it has a negative influence, but I never said \u201cI would never buy that book\u201d for these reasons, therefore I am not a hypocrite. I still think this type of imagery for couples, of any sexuality, is not healthy. Abuse and unequal power between men and women isn't an issue that should even be danced around. It's something to take seriously.\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2vtswv\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

Although it might be due to a high percentage of Americans and British culture is different. But I want a different view anyway since all my friends think what I'm doing is fine. I'm an only child if that changes anything.\n\nLong story short is I got employment after university with a different university that happens to be about 4 miles from my parents home. I couldn't realistically move much closer due to how the roads are around me that lead to the University require you to take a main road which is near my house. So without that motivation I've never seen the point to move out. I earn a very comfortable wage which is a good starting salary in IT business. I do my own washing and often shop for my parents and have payed for meals out and the like. I also pay rent to them but much less than 1/4 of what I'd pay for renting my own property. I don't feel like I'm scrounging in any way and they're financially better off with me living at home.\n\nObviously I don't want to live here forever and if I was dating in a serious relationship I'd move in with her. But in my present situation I really can't think of any reason why I'd spend 80% of my salary on moving out rather than to save it for the future at home. I don't spend a lot of money so it's all going into savings. I'm personally against one night stands so the likely hood of going out pulling a \"bird\" and bringing her back here are zero. If I were to meet someone that wouldn't date me on the premise I live at home, well I wouldn't  want to be with them anyway if they thought that was a legitimate reason not to be with somebody.\n\nBut considering how much a large part of Reddit believe this lifestyle is literally worse than Hitler, I wanted some counter opinions on it. I admit that living at home at 30 with kids and no job forcing your parents to raise your children for you is very irresponsible. But I feel given the right responsible circumstances living at home can be a good thing for both parent and child. \n\nAuthor: t3_1xdxmn\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

This brings up two views I hold that I challenge you to change:\n\n* \"Free-range parenting\" is not a bad thing at all, and in fact is the ideal way to parent. Smothering you child and being a \"helicopter\" parent is rarely beneficial for a child's mental and emotional development. Playing outside until dark increases a child's physical activity.

Crimes where children would be the primary victims (rape, murder, kidnapping) are at an all-time low.\n\n* \"Free-range parenting\" shouldn't be the labeled form or parenting, it should be seen as the better, *normal* way to raise your kids. \"Helicopter parenting\" or \"smother parenting\" should be the ones labeled because those actually harm the development and self-esteem of a kid. Through the label \"these\" parents are suddenly not \"normal\" anymore.

The chimpanzee often conducts homosexual acts *(though the greater scientific community agrees this is to advance social bonding or spice up sex lives, and not affection)*, and many gay rights activists use this against the idea that homosexuality is specifically a \"human sin\".\n\nHowever, chimpanzees also follow an alpha male, and females take the backseat to raise children. Does this mean we are justified in our history of having men lead, and women stay at home, up until the 1800s? \n\nFemale chimpanzees also are known to kill the young of other females to gain power and enforce their dominance in the female hierarchy. So should we accept the idea that the murder of the children of royal families in the age of monarchies was just a natural cycle of power to keep the lesser bloodlines in their place?\n\nAnimals are...well, *inhumane* in almost every aspect of life. We shouldn't be able to pick and choose, that one activity performed by a chimp is *beastly* and \"below\" humanity, while another is *natural* and should be integrated into society.\n\nPlease stay out of gay marriage if possible, and more into \"is homosexuality ok\" territory.\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_1rvhfc\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

I disagree.  I think myths about the virtue of a hard day's work are a useful to make the under-classed and working classes take pride in their bondage.  (As an aside, Twitter hashtags like #riseandgrind only show that in this age of technological advancement, there is still a stubborn and obsolete blue-collar pride-in-drudgery which refuses to die off).\n\nMy larger problem is that historical trends toward full automation and the widespread use of labour-saving devices show that we don't need to and truly don't want to be working hard when we can instead work smart or not at all.  \n\nI would further posit that this sense of pride actually comes from a place of fear; people sub-consciously recoil in terror from the thought that they might have wasted all or part of their lives working obsolete, socially pointless, technologically irrelevant jobs, and so their mind, as a coping mechanism, formulates this myth which allows them to blithely keep working only vaguely aware that they are complicit in stymieing the progress of the species.\n\nCMV PROVE TO ME THAT THERE IS VIRTUE IN HARD WORK.\n\nNOTE: Im talking about all hard work.  I dont want to hear a comparative analysis of why home-builders do more virtuous work than lever-pullers.  I am talking about all work that can be outsourced to machines or automated processses or otherwise streamlined in efficiency.\n\nNOTE2: Also, lets try and avoid personal attacks against me; I dont hate my fellow man, I have nothing against workers and I am not an elitist by any means.  I am the child of immigrants who worked their asses off and I have done my own share of menial labour in my life.\n\nNOTE3: I am not saying intellectual work is better than physical work.  Hands-on tinkering an learning is just as important as mental exercise.  And even office jobs and more cognitive processes that can be outsourced to machines should be.  I mean we hardly expect physicists to forego the use of calculators, right?  We know they know how to add and subtract, let a computer take care of that while they work on larger order problems.  Similarly, we now a carpenter can build a house, if a large-scale 3d printer can build one and allow the carpenter to work on passion projects, why not make that happen?\n\nAuthor: t3_1qsasw\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

I truly feel that other countries, while similarly patriotic, *also* enjoy watching soccer.\n\nBut in the US, no one gives a shit about soccer the other four years between World Cups. It's derided as \"not a good sport,\" youth programs receive way less attention than football, basketball, or baseball, and the MLB is pretty much the most poorly attended national sport their is. I don't even know if they show it on TV.\n\nSure, this may have to do more with advertisers and TV networks, but that makes it *worse*. That means that American's may be watching games that they might not even like, save for the fact that it helps big media companies get rich. You can sell way more ad space during a 3 hour football game (with about 30 minutes of game play) versus a game of soccer which is 90 minutes with only 3 ad breaks. Baseball has 168 games per year which again suits advertisers very well.\n\nAs a soccer player, I went out to a few bars to watch the games, and I was absolutely stunned at the turnout. The place was packed! But for what? The US's team never had a chance; they suck. If the fans had been supporting soccer for the past few decades by watching MLS, going to games, and spending money there, maybe the MLS would've attracted better talent, better youth players who would rise up, give us an actually competitive team, etc. The fact that any American can think you can just have a great team once every 4 years is pathetic.\n\nSo what do you think?\n\nThanks CMV'ers!\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_29qeeu\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

CMV.\n\nComment: Before I get downvoted to oblivion, knowing reddit's position when it comes to drug legislation, I'm referring to the actual advocates who promote marijuana legality (what I term the \"marijuana crowd\"), who I believe do more harm to their cause than good, rather than marijuana users themselves.\n\nI think it's only fair to start with my first, already implied, criticism against them - which seems to be the complete harassment or suppression of anyone who disagrees even slightly with their views, despite the majority being from liberal backgrounds. I think that was probably my first observation of the behaviour of the group, which is a behaviour I personally oppose, as a person who sees myself as quite liberal and open-minded and likes people to have a freedom to express opinion.\n\nThen, of course, we have the whole conspiratorial role - their ramblings that anyone who disagrees with them is \"brainwashed\" by \"big pharma\", and their belief in how their group is being \"victimised\" by the wider public (a public in which, from my view, they either make up the majority, or most others tend to be quite apathetic towards marijuana that antipathetic). \n\nMy biggest opposition of marijuana advocates came when, following a discussion about someone whose father died of cancer, one such advocate cropped up and said (to paraphrase) \"Damn big pharma! If your father had just smoked a joint, that would have cured his cancer, easy!\". It would have been fine if they'd implied \"helped with\", as I had heard that claim enough times, but that experience of \"cured\" had quite a defining effect for me in locking me into the mindset that such people are just parasites preying on the ill and the vulnerable with peer pressure and appeals to emotion; drug-pushers trying to recruit to their cause with so-called \"health benefits\".\n\nIt led me, quite frankly, to the belief that such people are selfish and ignorant towards the problems of others - almost sociopathic in either their suggestion or conviction that \"One puff solves all\", and that their drug is the \"best\" (or, at least, \"not as bad as [insert drug here]\").\n\nWhilst, I agree, cannabis has little to no physically addictive effect, I believe that cannabis culture has an almost indoctrinatory structure that provides almost a psychological addiction in and if itself. People are targeted at their lowest low, and don't quit because of all of the reasons I've mentioned above (they feel part of a community/culture and adopted the norms and values - a culture than, in my opinion, seems to have many of the traits of a sect etc.), plus it having provided them the thrill to get them out of hard times.\n\n**How to change my view**\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, in spite of all this, I'm looking for some form of evidence or reassurance that marijuana advocates are actual human beings, and that many of the extreme behaviours are just the actions and opinions of a vocal minority.\n\nI don't want evidence that the drug itself is good, but I am looking for some reason why I should vote to let such people get what they want. \n\nEven better, I want you to challenge my perception of such people - try to find a way to show me that I have, infact, got it all wrong, and most advocates aren't like that.\n\nAuthor: t3_1tqnn6\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

My little brother wasn't vaccinated, and he's one of the healthiest kids I've ever seen.  He's never sick, even when there is a disease going around in his class.  People have to understand that vaccination is part of a business like anything else.  Of course they're going to push unnecessary vaccinations on the public if it's profitable!  So we immunize our children against diseases that they will more than likely never come into contact with.  I know a main argument against vaccination is that the chances of getting infected or contracting the disease from the vaccine is a bigger risk than the actual disease itself.  Maybe this points to the fact that we need better vaccinations, which is something that most people ignore blindly, except for the anti-vaccination crowd.\nI think that the new idea that unvaccinated children should be isolated from other children is unfair to those children.  They might suffer isolation and stunted social development all because their parents refused to get some vaccine for a disease that hasn't existed in their country for 30 years.  In any case, if you are so sure that vaccines work, why are you worried?  If vaccines function the way they should, children should be immune to these diseases and therefore the well being of unvaccinated children should be irrelevant and left to the parents of those children.\nMaybe I'm missing something, but I get aggravated whenever I see people spewing vitriol against a viewpoint that I can sympathize with.

Right now I'm balancing my time between studying for the LSAT and trying to do research for my senior honors thesis and I'm just having such a sense of \"who the hell cares about my honors thesis.\" It would be really nice if someone could change my view on the topic. I'm also drunk so please excuse some informal argumentation.\n\n**Argument 1:** Philosophy never ever ever leads to figuring out anything true. Not one time in all of history has philosophy ever found truth on even one small itty bitty thing. It's come up bone dry in the past 3,000 years. When I tell this to people, I get a number of responses:\n\nResponse 1: \"But philosophy practically created science. In that sense, every physics victory is a point for the philosophers.\"\n\nThis line of argumentation doesn't work. Sciences like physics weren't examples of philosophy successfully solving a philosophy problem. It was an example of people figuring out that these problems weren't philosophical to begin with. Philosophers didn't create science either. This is a myth. There's no nice clean scientific method produced by philosophers and handed down to the scientists. I was a big proponent of this myth for a while myself but it's just not historically accurate. Scientists have a lot of methods adapted for the specific questions being asked. There's no crisp formula for what they do. I don't really want to write out the entire history of science, but it really is the case that we just got better at writing down our observations and better at testing our ideas to give us better information. Many of those doing so happened to also be philosophers. And then eventually natural philosophers just called themselves scientists.\n\nResponse 2: \"But look at Kant or Frege or whoever *my* favorite philosopher is, they did a whole lot. Surely they figured something out!\"\n\nNo they didn't. Every philosopher I tell this to has a different person in mind for who figured it out. It's hard to come up with why anyone would ever think a philosopher figured something out. I've had people tell me that Kant figured out how to bridge the gap between rationalists and empiricists, that's figuring out something, right? No. There are still empiricists today who think rationalism is false. There are still pure rationalists too. Kant didn't end the debate, he just added yet another possible answer. He didn't convince the world of the noumenal/phenomenal split either. Tons of philosophers doubt the existence of either one of those. The categorical imperative isn't universally considered true, just nothing he said convinced the world definitively. \n\nI've have people tell me that Frege made progress with symbolic logic and made things happen. Unfortunately, that's not the only logic out there. Defenders of paraconsistant logic say Frege got it wrong. \"But he still gave us symbols to use for logic right?\" Okay, so he gave us a new way to write things down. Where are the true facts about our world? No philosopher ever convinced the world of anything. We can't even get philosophers certain that A=A. I just picked Kant and Frege randomly by the way, I could have picked anyone. No philosopher has ever convinced the world of anything.\n\nResponse 3: \"But we figured out that slavery is wrong, that women should have rights, and all that good shit. Look at society's progess on philosophical issues.\"\n\nNo. Social activists, politicians, and society as a whole figured all that stuff out. Not philosophers. There has never been a time where the philosophical community as a whole has gotten together to lead the charge on an issue nor has there been a time where society has looked to its philosophers for the answer to deep moral truths or any other kind of truths. Philosophy had to catch up. And even then, we couldn't derive these truths. Go ask 500 different philosophers why women should have rights or why slavery or the holocaust is wrong. I bet you'll get 500 different answers. Hell, even if you ask 500 consequentialists or 500 deontologists then you'll get 500 answers. What this means is that we have no idea. Compare this to if you ask 500 physicists how we know the speed of light. You'll get one answer 500 times. \n\nResponse 4: \"Well, philosophers can't agree but odds are, at least one of them as said something true. You can't just dismiss it as false because there's no consensus.\"\n\nOkay, this is probably true. But who said the true thing? I can't look at any one philosopher and go, \"Yep, he got it right.\" I can only look to a sea of them and say, \"Odds are that at least one of them got it right on something.\" Near as I can tell, that's no better than just calling it all wrong.\n\nResponse 5: \"But look at this phil survey. Atheism is at like 70% or something, non-skeptical realism is at like 85% or something, surely that's a consensus, right?\"\n\nNo. If 30% of philosophers or 15% of philosophers who are well educated professionals can reasonably hold a contrary view to the majority then whatever view that is, isn't knowledge. Imagine if only 70% of engineers thought a car's breaks would work past 80 mph. I bet you wouldn't speed in that car. Or imagine if 15% of well respected biologists were creationists, I bet you wouldn't think creationism was obviously stupid and you'd be somewhat skeptical about evolution. \n\nResponse 6: But what about fields like feminist philosophy? There's a lot of consensus on things like that abortion is morally permissible, women are XYZ, and other stuff like that.\n\nNo. That's just philosophy written by a demographic that's likely to agree on those things. It's not that the philosophy figured out deep truths and came to a consensus. It's that they got a bunch of people who (mostly) agree with those claims to write philosophy. No shit there's a consensus but it doesn't really count. In fact, philosophy professors in general are of a particular demographic which is responsible for a lot of false consensus. Nobody ever conclusively proved God's nonexistence. 70% agree on it because they're demographic is likely to agree on it.\n\n**Argument 2:** Even if philosophy was able to come up with true statements and what I said in argument one was false, a lot of philosophy is still bullshit.\n\nI can understand the value of figuring out what knowledge is or what the most general structure to think about the world ought to be. I can see the value in knowing how language works or how consciousness related to the brain. My problem in argument one is that even if this stuff is worth figuring it out, we can't figure it out. In argument two, I want to spell out that some of it is just fucking stupid. \n\nSomehow psychoanalysts started to get called philosophers. What the flippity fuck? How can a discipline have self respect with these guys in the department? Moreover, why is feminism philosophy? I'm not anti-feminism or anything like a lot of redditors but feminism belongs in the Women's studies department and not the philosophy department. It's not questioning the fundamental aspects of the universe. It's social justice/activism mixed with politics, trivial amounts of ethical theory, and at its worst, psychoanalysis. The conglomeration of all that does not make it philosophy. \n\nAnd then there's the continentals. Hoooollllyy shit. They are just the worst fucks ever to get called academics (the disciplines in the above paragraph are continental disciplines). I'm not interested in the meaning of life and absurdism or anything. Existentialism is stupid. Derrida belongs in the english department and not the philosophy department. It's just such a waste of time. Fortunately, my department is pretty much entirely analytic because I go to a good school but Christ. It's just embarrassing to be thought of in the same discipline. I guess the existence of continentals does nothing to ruin analytic philosophy, I just hate it so much when people assume that these guys count as philosophers. \n\n\n**Argument 3:** It's not a magical and productive use of your time to learn that you can't really know anything. \n\nI guess this is a cool thing to really understand and figure out but it takes one year to fully understand that you know nothing and then (in my case) another year to figure out that the realization at the end of the first year was a wall and philosophy never does anything after that and then you just waste time for two more years. I guess there's always more to read but I think I figured out the main point already. The world is weird, unknowable, we can't even know that it's unknowable, but acknowledging that means we can, which means we can't, and yeah... After figuring out that weirdness and really experiencing it, you're just at a wall. It's never changing. You're done. \n\n**Argument 4:** It doesn't give you deep sounding pretentious things to say at parties.\n\nI guess you can be pretentious about anything but analytic philosophy doesn't lend itself to that nearly as well as you'd think it does. Continental philosophy on the other hand....\n\n\n**Argument 5:** Nobody even knows what philosophy is. \n\nIt makes it really hard to tell people what you do or why they're not doing it. \n\n**Argument 6:** I hate being associated with stupid 16 year old stoners. \n\n/r/stonerphilosophy is a thing. Why isn't /r/stonerphysics?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_291go8\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

Probably a couple of years at the very least. But I kept putting it off because I wanted things to get better, to heal, to change. I worked side-by-side with people that I thought were pushing for a better con community for fans. With a few exceptions, in the nine years I've been working with the con community I've seen:\n\n1. More harassment, either verbal or physical.\n2. More sexually-charged environments, with more children in them.\n3. More predators using cons as a place to find a cheap dinner.\n4. More exploitation of fans. (Higher prices for less. Special fees for signings, special premium packages, more fans crammed into the same space, making guests inaccessible, etc.)\n5. Less support for the emerging artists, authors, actors and 'little people' that are actually what supports a local fanbase.\n\nSmall Tomatoes Press has done a lot over the years to support the con community. We've provided prizes and auction items. We've done presentations for several cons. When the  business had to move, we looked into our local options and quickly ran away. It is so toxic. \n\nThese cons are hurting people. They are hurting a lot of people as far as I can tell. How many poor underaged girls does con security need to scrap up off the floor of a drunken party before they shut the friggin' parties down? \n\nThere are still some very good people involved in the larger con community and some cons have a lot of good people working for them. But they all seem to be fighting the same problems over and over and over. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s getting better because it seems like at every con there are several key players are total creeps. The community seems to accept with varying degrees of disappointment the under aged peep-show vibe and pandering to various special interests groups that have nothing to do with Sci-Fi, Fantasy or Gaming within the con space.  \n\nBut the most damning issue is that most cons no longer seem to be for the fans. They've turned into trade shows for companies, actors and authors that serve nerdy tastes. If a big name shows up, it's almost impossible to get face time -- they are surrounded by security and whisked from one monotone panel to the next. Everyone is there to see or be seen. \n\nI still have a great deal of affection for my home con, but even it has some struggles in the last few years as it has gotten bigger. \n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2l2lja\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

I feel they are too quick to draw their guns and fire. I believe that we should hold police to higher standards and deliver proper indictments when the shooting was unjustified. \n\nHowever, I also believe that we should hold communities affected by police brutality to a higher standard as well. It is very easy to point at the cop who shot the unarmed man and blame him/her for this egregious injustice. However, some of the responsibility needs to fall on these communities. The types of neighborhoods most affected by this are low-income, inner-city neighborhoods. A major reason that there is so much police presence and tension in these areas is become the crime rates are so high. People are selling drugs, dropping out of school to join gangs, fighting in the streets, waiving their guns around, etc. If these people cleaned up their streets and did the right thing the police would have no reason to harass them.\n\nI believe that making this into a race issue is the easy way out.

Many cyclists (including, I'll admit, myself on occasion) already run stop signs on empty streets, and this would make normal cycling behavior that is currently illegal, legal. \n\nMoreover, any legal changes governments can make to benefit cyclists will  benefit society as a whole, by reducing emissions, increasing open space on roads (compare the footprint of 1 person in a car, even a small car, alone vs 1 person on a bicycle), and increasing the overall health of the community. This law is straightforward and simple, and does not require significant additional investment, compared with, say, painting additional bike lanes.\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_31btbz\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

To elucidate my point, there is a map by a reporter named Colin Woodward that expresses the kind of cultural and political divisions I\u2019m talking about: (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2013/11/08/which-of-the-11-american-nations-do-you-live-in/). It would be very helpful to at least look at the maps on the link before responding.\n\nI believe that it would be ideal that these U.S. \u201cNations\u201d or culturally independent regions, in fact become independent and form their own independent governments. I feel this would benefit their populations in the following ways: \n\n1. It would allow for these governments to address individual problems more effectively, as the problems effecting each region are quite different. The inference being that the population of a cultural group knows best how to address those problems. \n\n2. It would foster more effective democracies since the will of the people to enact their own legislation would not be bogged down in the wash of so many other groups interest (as the situation currently is in D.C.). Since legislation would be more easily passed, it would give people the empowering feeling brought about by self-determination, and make the populations of these regions ultimately happier.\n\n3. If those countries continued to have governments with representatives, it would be easier to effect the political process since (considering reductions of scale) talking to your local, or state representative would have a more powerful impact on the laws actually passed.\n\nNow, let me consider objections that I anticipate:\n\n1. For those of you that say that for some of these regions there is a history of human rights or social justice problems that are only properly addressed by a larger central government, I don\u2019t entirely disagree with you, and I won\u2019t say that you\u2019re wrong or that no intervention is necessary by the \u201cmore socially enlightened\u201d cultural group. What I will say is that the situation is analogous to  (although in a slightly less extreme way than) the U.S. interfering in the affairs of other countries (like, for instance, Pakistan). It seems like the solutions that work to problems like these in the current global situation are diplomacy or sanctions, not domination\u2026 especially considering that the kinds of human rights problems that would arise if the U.S. split up today, pale in comparison to many of the human rights issues faced in other countries that we would never consider (nor should we consider) invading. Again, because we have seen that when we invade the country of a different cultural group and try to impose our own cultural regime, it often has unforeseen consequences that members of the foreign cultural group are vlid to by virtue of their foreignness. The different cultural groups within the United States are more similar, but still different enough for this problem to still arise, albeit to a lesser degree.\n\n2. For those of you that say a solution like this is impractical to implement given the current infrastructure of the country: this is a valid objection, but for the purposes of this discussion I\u2019d like to talk about what the ideal situation would be, not the nitty gritty of how it would be implemented bureaucratically or technically. To CMV, you should tell me why this would not be the ideal situation should we be able to implement it successfully.\n\n3. For those of you that say that creating new borders would cause a burden for travel and commerce given the creation of new international borders: I can easily travel to another country now, if I have a passport. And, boarders have not posed much of an economic problem for current international companies that have aspects of their production and distribution processes scattered all over the globe. There may be a problem when it comes to moving to another state (which would turn into immigration), but I don\u2019t see this as a major issue. Again, issues such as immigration are one of the things that these individual cultural cohorts should be able to self-determine.\n\n4. For those of you that say \u201cThe south already tried that and it didn\u2019t work out so well...\u201d I will say again that to CMV, you should not tell me why it\u2019s impractical to implement given the current infrastructure of the country. I\u2019m only interested in why this would not be the ideal situation should we be able to implement it successfully.\n\nThat being said, please CMV!\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nThis is exactly what I was doing. The problem is not necessarily that the country is too big, but that the current electoral system does not do a very good job of adequately representing the will of the people (and therefore, in my mind, violates the basic social contract that the government gets it's authority to legislate by the consent of the governed). But it does not follow from that that the solution is to break up the country. It would be more reasonable to advocate for electoral reform. How to do that or whether that is practical is another question for another thread.

I don't know of any chef or restaurant that takes it from the oven to the cooler for it to reach it's optimal quality before serving.\n* Therefore, warm/hot pizza will always be better than cold pizza, and spending even 45 seconds in a microwave will make the enjoyment increase several orders in magnitude.\n* If you disagree with this, I posit you a) are lazy b) have poor taste in pizza c) have great taste in quiche d) all of the above.  \n\n\nAuthor: t3_2chdyb\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

A quick search gives us this:\n\n\nWhile this is good enough I don't think its sufficient. This may be the definition of art but it is hardly the purpose. The purpose of art (imo) is to convey a complex idea. And that is really what comes into question when it comes to Video Games. Nobody could really contest that a game creator uses \"creative skill and imagination\" to make their product. The contention comes when you think about whether games convey an idea or are simply entertainment. In the rest of this post I will show firstly the difference between things in a medium that do and do not fulfill the purpose of art. I will then show how video games are a superior art form as opposed to moves painting and the like. Finally Ill show some examples of games that fit into the categories of art and non-art. I realize that I'm dealing with a lot of abstracts here and it's impossible to be truly objective, but I'll do my best to represent what I mean.\n\n**What does and does not fit the definition and purpose of art**\n\nThe easiest medium for this would be photography. First ill show some pictures that fulfill neither the definition or purpose of art: [this is not art](http://i.imgur.com/rToHN7V.jpg), [this is not art](http://i.imgur.com/R3KWNYh.jpg), and [this is not art]\n(http://i.imgur.com/3nDiflo.gif). \n\nThe second category is a bit more difficult, but here are some that fit the definition of art but not the purpose: [This fits the definition of art](http://i.imgur.com/SNtyCAo.jpg), [so does this](http://i.imgur.com/hgSE2zo.jpg), [and this](http://i.imgur.com/wapYmO9.jpg). They are all certainly a product of human creativity and fit the definition of art. But what complex idea do they convey, do they meet the purpose of art?\n\nFinally pictures that meet both the definition and purpose of art: [This is one](http://i.imgur.com/Kjjc37e.jpg),  [Another](http://i.imgur.com/GShdiyo.jpg), [I'd even say this too](http://i.imgur.com/lHgFjs5.jpg).\n\nI was planning to do music and movies as well but these media are much more difficult to breakdown and as a result it would make this about twice as long and three times as abstract.\n\n**Why Video Games are a Superior Art Form**\n\nThe main idea here is that video games are interactive. You directly experience the feeling or idea that is being represented in the work. This makes it a much more powerful and personal experience than watching a movie or listening to a song. I have never went to a friend and talked for 20 minutes about how a song in which the artist was portraying their anger and talked about how angry I was. But I have had a bad game experience and went to talk to my friend for 20 minutes about how I was mad. What im trying to say is best represented in this quote [\"...you don't have to empathize with a character on a screen, the feeling happens directly to you.\"](http://youtu.be/8FpigqfcvlM?t=14m51s). Its like taking the phrease 'show don't tell' and moving it to the next level, 'feel don't show'. \n\nI find that games are the best art form because they fulfill the purpose of art in a way no other medium thus far can possibly hope to.\n\nMost of this power comes from good game design but this is also true of other forms of media. A badly made movie will fail to show the struggle of a father/son dynamic as well as 'The Godfather'.\n\nI realize that this is going to be the most controversial pert of my post so, fell free to reply even if you think that video games are an art form but not the best as I claim here.\n\n**What games do and do not fit the definition and purpose of art**\n\nNote: I am not saying that the games listed here are good or bad simple whether or not the fit the definition and purpose of art. I'll be using commonplace titles so that even people who don't play very many games will have a general idea about what game I'm talking about.\n\nGames that do not fit the definition of art: [FIFA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_(video_game_series)), [Farmville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FarmVille), and [Solitaire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire_(Windows) ). You can see that most of these are simulations of things in real life and are not very creative, mostly they fill the purpose of simple entertainment or time filling. This is not to say that simulations cannot be artful as [3rd World Farmer](http://www.3rdworldfarmer.com/) is a simulation game that fulfills the purpose of art very well.\n\nGames that fit the definition of art but not the purpose. [Super Mario Bros.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.). Its hard to think of specific examples of this but I think the one is sufficient. Its a very creative and well designed game.\n\nNest are games that fulfill both the definition and purpose of art. In this section I'll talk for a short biit about what parts of these games make it artful. [Amnesia: The Dark Descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia:_The_Dark_Descent), this game is fear and panic incarnate. [Mark of the Ninja](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_Ninja), ever wonder what it's like to be a ninja? [Papers, Please](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papers_please), this game is really difficult to describe, pretty much you are a worker at the boarder of an oppressive dictatorship, it's definitely worth a play if you are looking got something truly unique. Lastly [Antichamber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichamber), for if you ever want to break your brain.\n\nWith games, I have added a 4th category that comes directly due to interactivity. These ae games that *can* be art. I think what I mean by that will become more clear as I show some examples. [Call of Duty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_duty), of course you have the well known '12 year old who slept with everyone mother' but many parts of this game are powerful message about what war is like; there are better representations of this but this game fits this category very well. [League of Legends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends), this game can be anything from a mindless time sink to an immersive experience where you directly experience victory, defeat, panic, triumph, fear, and even the occasional sportsmanship. [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyrim), this is truly the best representation of this category, anybody who has played can tell you about the amazing landscapes (I just gotta freak out for a second, when I first saw the Soul Cairn, my brain exploded. And the last area of the main quest just makes you feel like a bad-ass who has crossed worlds to beat this evil, its just awesome). The potential art in this game is immense, from the world design even to how the character interacts allows the player to fell and be something the never could. This is what I mean by the category *can* be art. These games fulfill the purpose of art if the player makes it so.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nGames are a superior art form because they have interactivity and allow the player to directly feel the idea that is being conveyed by the creators. This at its core fulfills the purpose of art better than any other medium can. All media have things that are art, and that are not art. Just because you can point to some games that are not artistic does not mean the medium is invalid as a form of art.\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2bkf5u\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

CMV\n\nComment: I used to openly disregard the idea of fate. The concept of destiny seemed so akin to religion (something I find totally unfounded in logic) that I immediately rejected it. However, after reading some philosophy on the subject I ended up developing a perspective that I can't seem to logically disprove in my head. It goes as follows. It is commonly accepted that every action has a reaction. Thus every reaction was caused by an action, and that action was caused by an action before that, ad infinitum. Thus, it seems logically feasible to trace every reaction back to its origin action all the way back to some original, massive action (for example, the Big Bang). It seems to me that if one could accurately predict the reaction to any conceivable action, we could predict the future 100% accurately. Of course, the requisite mathematical models will probably never be discovered by humans because they would have to be incredibly complex (taking into account myriad variables) as well as incredibly accurate. In terms of free will, I do not believe that it truly exists. Any action being made out of \"free will\" was in fact made as the result of some kind of thought process, however \"random\", that was the result of some environmental catalyst(s), which served as the origin action of the \"free will\" action.

CMV\n\nComment: I'm a couple years deep into a career as an educator. Between my experiences with all kinds of students, and reading blogs such as [YANSM](http://youarenotsosmart.com/), I've come to see that behaviors or attitudes that many would call stupid is just the result of the brain being really resistant to change.\n\nI want to clarify that I'm not sure about people who have legitimate neurological difficulties. You may call them stupid, though that wouldn't be very fair. I'm mostly talking about your average jock student or facebook bimbo. I don't think even they are stupid.\n\nHere is what I think about intelligence:\n\n - Being wrong about anything is not a sign of stupidity. There are a thousand tricks the brain employs to cling to its misconceptions. Confirmation bias is a huge one, for example.\n - In addition, not knowing a fact that \"everyone knows\" is also not a sign of stupidity. People haven't had the experiences you have.\n - Judgment of intelligence is antisymmetric. Mistakes that we make are justified and forgotten, but someone else can make a single mistake and that's a sign of a weak mind. It's unfair and it's false. \n - While some *are* born with greater mental acuity, many of the characteristics we would associate with intelligence are trained skills. For example, see the family of [L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Polg\u00e1r](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r). Perhaps people we'd consider stupid are just people who have chosen to pursue other skills. (This is related to my other idea that \"natural\" intelligence as a characteristic is extremely overvalued, but that's for a different post).\n\nThe reason I brought this to CMV was because I don't think most people share this view. Am I \"advanced\" because I've thought about this stuff for a long time, or am I missing something obvious that everyone else is getting? I'm hoping you guys could help me decide.\n\nAuthor: t3_1mrmht\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

This will lead to most men just hiring prostitutes as a substitute to real relationships and a population crash will happen\n\nComment: Sorry for the long title but I think all of these events will all happen in tandem as a larger structural social change in relationships between men and women.\n\nHere is overall what I think will happen. I apologize, this will be long. I have sources below.\n\nWe are already seeing online dating become the \"normal\" way to meet people, but in 15-20 it will be the ONLY way that is acceptable by society to meet people. Sorta like how when women go out with each other on a \"girls night out\", they don't want men approaching them. It will be like that, but everywhere. Everyone will be expected to \"meet\" online before actually going on a date in person.\n\nRight now, we already know how loopsided online dating is, even though it's becoming the \"normal\" way to date, as far as the number of messages women get versus how much they actually reply to (less than 1% maybe). So most guys already hate online dating and regard it as a waste of time but just do it because it's \"easy\". I expect this dynamic not to change at all over the next 10 while online dating slowly completely takes over with a few giants like facebook or google becoming the dominant players in online dating. Just like now how pretty much everybody has a facebook profile, everybody will have a online dating profile to check to indicate their relationship status and will be used to find dates.\n\nNow after the 10 year mark of this dating transformation (moving to completely online), there will actually start to be a huge decline in the **male user base, due to the frustration that most men can't get dates online and it is now impossible to get dates in real life either since that is not an option due to the social stigma of approaching women. Online dating sites will actually start having a loopsided userbase where it is vastly female dominated, at about 5:1 female:male ratio.\n\nSlowly, over the next 5 years, prostitution services will see a huge boom in business, and will start moving to accommodate. A few years after the prostitution boom, along site of the normal female dominated online dating sites, there will be an equivalent \"dating service\" for all of these men, at a price, that will still be prostitution at it's core, but more like escorts or temporary girlfriends. Not the $10,000/night escorts that politicians use, but more like the $200/weekend type escort girls. In 20-30 years, there will be tons of these services around, and most guys will just sign up for these and just pay for \"weekend girlfriends\" instead of joining the actually dating sites. This will become completely normal, while the top 10% of attractive guys and rich guys stay on the dating sites where there are an abundance of women who will date/sleep with them.\n\nThis, of course, will cause a big population bust in the far future.\n\nAs for women, a lot will stay on the dating sites and cycle through the 10% of guys on there, but a lot will just go into prostitution due to the boom of the industry.\n\nYes this future of society sounds dystopian, so CMV.\n\nSources: http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/10/23/online-dating-game-goes-mainstream http://www.businessinsider.com/likelihood-of-getting-a-response-in-online-dating-men-vs-women-2013-7 http://www.timeout.com/chicago/things-to-do/does-dating-frustration-fuel-demand-for-prostitution\n\nAuthor: t3_2uonaj\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

In the job market today, those majoring in math related fields always get the higher pay than those majoring in the arts. It seems to me, though I may be wrong, that only the most talented writers, artists, actors,etc get a very high pay. Those that are about average can't really get a stable job, whereas average engineers can get a stable job. It just seems to me that society values mathematical intelligence the most. Also, I think that all those technological innovations like cars, internet,etc have impacted society and it's economy the most. So when I see people with good language skills, when compared with people with good mathematical skills, I tend to view the people with good mathematical skills as more intelligent. Since those in math related fields earn on average a higher pay, I conclude that they are more valued by society, and therefore have more worth than those that are not so mathematically inclined.\n\nBasically, I need help changing this two views of mine that are interconnected, because those are the roots of a problem that I have. I will be very happy indeed if anyone here can help me in my problems, since you all seem very intelligent. \n\nGrowing up, my parents and teachers place the utmost importance on academic achievement and I seem to get the message that if you are not smart enough, then you are just not good enough. Smarter people are just better in some absolute sense. So I place my entire self worth on my intelligence and naturally, because of that, I would like to be smarter than average, because it boosts my ego. Although, I'm well aware that I'm not even clots to the smartest people out there,I find this constant comparison with my peers extremely narcissistic. One part of my mind wants to view myself as equal to everyone else, while the other doesn't because it diminishes my own self importance. So, I don't know how to deal with these two very conflicting thoughts of mine. \n\n\nI do hope that you smart guys can help me out on my problem, though I know it is not a view.

You shouldn't even try to change my view because what I speak is a truth manifested by the movement of all mankind throughout history. That said, it ain't easy defending skipping as the most underutilized, underappreciated, and underrated form of human travel due to it's ostracization throughout history. One quick example is noted in JRR Tolkien historic novella, \"Lord of the Rings,\" as the orcs, the bad guys, NEVER skip (no citations needed). Not once. That's why they're so angry: because they never experienced the magic of skipping. And that's why we went to war: lack of skipping. If they had skipped into battle then they would've canceled the war altogether and ate lembas bread and watch Gandalf shoot fireworks. The middle ages would've be a better place. Therefore, skipping is more than just an efficient form of travel: it's an opportunity to change ones lifestyle.\n\nThe first lifestyle change lies in the efficiency of skipping, because you're using the power of science to momentum yourself around from Point A to Point B through Z (Z because you saved so much energy from not running that you can actually go all places you couldn't go before). Dan Carlin of Hardcore History notes in his lesson on Alexander the Great that the armies would often times march at a constant pace, and eventually his men were bitter because they were so far from home. If they had skipped, they would've traveled THRICE as far and actually circled the globe and would've been back home already. \n\nAdditionally, skipping helps the heart. It's more functional than other natural movements. Walking is lumberous, crawling hurts on sidewalk, moonwalking is too slow, and running makes you elitist and then you spend money on shoes and heartrate monitors and eventually you leave for some triathlete. But skipping would never do that, because skipping doesn't cheat. Skipping doesn't lie. Skipping doesn't hurt. Skipping is an opportunity to feel again. It lets you feel the wind upon your face after nights alone in the dark. Skipping let's you feel like you're going places and not stuck in second gear all the time. It let's you feel like there's more to life than just... being left behind. Skipping makes you feel alive, again. \n\nNext in line for the True Facts Report on this vehicle of the human body is that skipping fills your body with joy. It's what the Grinch should've done to originally make his heart grow three sizes bigger, because it makes even the most curmudgeonly of folk feel better about life. A man once said, \"motion changes **e**motion.\" The body can't help but release chemicals whilst skipping, causing us to feel elation, euphoria, excitement, and excitement, and other e-words. \n\nLastly, it's contagious. You throw in a bit of whistling and some arm back-and-forth and you got yourself a regular ole ballyhoo that others will see as an opportunity to shed their blanket bitterness against life and actually do something to curb their frustrations. It's a physical activity that others can't help but join in, like a Conga Line or a spontaneous riot. Imagine the streets filled with skipping whistlers, with men who dream, with folks who actually care again. Men, women, and elderly locked arms and skipping, whistling show tunes and making life a better place to be.\n\nNot only is skipping the most underutilized and unappreciated form of human travel, but it's opportunity to be happy again, and that's why it's the most underrated form of travel.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2eqqn4\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

One of my frustrations when trying to discuss feminism or equality is that as a man i feel my ideas or opinions are largely ignored or attacked by women. I often get a  \"your a guy so you wouldn't understand\". Not only is this aggravating but is hypocritical since equality would mean we all have an equal voice in the discussion, i digress. \n\nAnyways in trying to understand why these discussions so often breakdown i came to the conclusion that what one person considers equal another does not. This seems obvious but I don't mean that a chauvinistic man who believe all women should be house wives thinks that that is equal. Instead i mean to say that me someone who wants equality for all people, believes that requires vastly different things than the women i'm talking with. \n\nTo better illustrate this point i think that equality would mean that everyone is given the same opportunity without bias; this means if your black and you are a better applicant than a white person you get the job, similar situation no matter the relation. Same goes for the law, if a man is held responsible for his actions while intoxicated shouldn't a woman be as well. (I'm not saying if someone got her drunk against her will i mean if she made the decision to drink alcohol) But many would disagree with me and say this is not fair, that minorities and women need to be protected under the law so that the majority (us white men) don't take advantage. \n\nSo i don't think we can ever reach \"equality\" because due to peoples different opinions on what that means there will always be those who are not equal in someones mind, and discussions to reach it will not go far, at least not as quickly as they should. \n\nTo change my view should not be hard since i am not emotionally attached to this idea since i just thought of it.

Many Republicans would ban gay sex entirely if they could.\n* Conservatives wish to restrict my fellow Americans' ability to access healthcare. It's logical, in my opinion, that this will result in preventable deaths and patients who will live the rest of their lives in debt.\n* On a similar note, Republicans would also like to take away the ability to have safe, clean abortions from my friends who are ciswomen.\n* Southern Republicans often spout rhetoric about shooting immigrants on sight. Those who don't seem to think isolationism is the answer.\n* Christian Republicans want to legislate their religion and try to do so constantly. As a non-Christian queer, this angers and terrifies me.\n* The GOP started the War On Drugs, a policy which is obviously a gross mismanagement of taxpayer dollars and racist to boot. Never mind the fact it's none of the government's business if I smoke weed, as long as I'm not driving afterward.\n* The last Republican president started two wars that killed thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of foreigners.

This is a capitalist society, and LGBT folks are allowed to vote with their dollars.\n\nIf a company fires their CEO who publicly donated to conservative causes that restrict the rights of minorities, isn't it just a reaction to the market?

I would argue males have it much worse. [Batman](http://imgur.com/3jutEgJ,JnShAYB#0) and [Superman](http://imgur.com/3jutEgJ,JnShAYB#1) are prime examples of this.

In other words - this kind of physique is just not possible for 99.9%. No wonder there are so many kids using steroids these days. They're bombarded with images like this when they open a comic book, watch tv, and play videogames. Men just don't bitch about it as much as women. Here's a look at a recent game called [enslaved](http://imgur.com/uGWhula). You tell me which physique is more unattainable - the males or the females. Personally, I enjoy the cartoon-like bodies because I've never felt pressure to fully attain them... But obviously some can't handle it and I understand that. Feminists always preach that they fight for 'equality' not just women's issues. If that's truly the case they should be fighting for both men AND women's image issues in videogames.

My enquiry is why don't both sides work together on this issue since it's the same thing. It just seems like a lot of social media is focused solely on the women regarding an issue that both men and women are affected by. A lot more would be accomplished if both of these issues were tackled at the same time.\n\n\nP.S. When people are rude (especially about this subject) it only reinforces the negative stereotypes already perceived by the other party. This goes for MRAs and feminists.

Obama is *definitely* not a socialist and that a little more socialism in the U.S. will help our country prosper.\n\nIn addition to the socialized institutions we have now: police, fire department, public schools, postal service, etc.  we should also have socialized health care, higher education, and utility services that everyone depends on like electricity, natural gas, and water.\n\nI have heard interviews that expanding the Medicaid program for more families to be eligible to 'buy in' would be much cheaper than the 'Obamacare' bill as it stands now.  New York already had a similar program in place with Family Health Plus and Child Care Plus, but I think broadening the income eligibility would be a great solution, even if buyers had to pay the full premium. I had to pay the full premium as part of a child support order ($78/week) and would gladly pay that for myself or other members of my family.\n\nSome communities already have co-ops (publicly owned utilities) that are much more reasonable in price than private or corporate-owned utilities.  I have yet to find someone in the service area of a co-op complain about their service.  The city I live in sold their publicly-owned (municipal) water company to a private entity.  No change in service, yet the cost of water and sewer service has literally tripled since the change.  I think these are essential to public well-being and should not be monopolized by a for-profit corporation.\n\nThe only compelling argument against this I have heard so far is that private corporations will spend more money on R&amp;D and innovative technologies.

There's a few main points to my view that I will try to outline as clearly as possible.\n\n1) Nintendo botched the launch of the Wii u by not providing titles people wanted.\n\nNintendo has three games that get more attention than the others. Mario Kart, Smash Bros, and Mario Party, none of these games existed for the first 18 months of the consoles life. The wii u launched in November of 2012, Mario Kart arrived in May of 2014, Smash Bros in November 2014 and Mario Part is coming in March of 2015. The Wii u does little besides games so for the first 18 months there was no reason to buy the console and hype fizzled and died. These games should have been available on launch so they could build as much hype for the console as possible. They had a good lead on the Xbox One and PS4 and could have captured many more sales if the console actually had games.\n\n2) Nintendo doesn't seem to care about third party developers and as a result you pay the cost of a full console to play a few games.\n\nWith the Wii U not doing much besides games I essentially wrap the price of each game into the console. After buying the console and controllers I spent roughly $500 on the console, and I currently have 2 games for it (Mario Kart and Smash Bros). At $50 a game if I end up with 4 games I enjoy I have spent $700 for 4 games, or $175 for each game. As someone with a full time job I can handle this cost as I really love Nintendo games. If you play console games exclusively you still face that dilemma of few third party games being made available on the Wii u and may still want to buy an Xbox or PS4.\n\n3) Because Nintendo has to compete against the Xbox One and the PS4 they are forced to implement features without having Dozens of developers paying to use them.\n\nNintendo is trying to make fully featured online and social communities for their games. With the exception of scale they are trying to implement the same things Microsoft and Sony do, however Nintendo does not have dozens of publishers providing money through licensing and royalties. Just as the limited games inflates the cost per game (when taking the console into account) the limited games carry a much higher share of the cost of the features they require. The tens to hundreds of millions of dollars that go into online services become much easier to bare when spread across 100+ games as the Xbox 360 and PS4 eventually had. \n\nAs much as I love Nintendo and enjoy their consoles I feel that the Wii U should be their last console. It simply does not make sense to put all the resources into building their own console. If games like Mario Kart and Smash Bros were available on the Xbox, PS4 and PC Nintendo could make significantly more money with much less overhead in their business. \n\nI hate thinking that Nintendo is so horribly mismanaged, but I cannot see another side to this, so please Reddit, change my view.\n\nAuthor: t3_2sjck6\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

CMV\n\nComment: This is a quandary of logic that I discovered a while back. Put simply the idea is put forward that any religion that calls for the sharing with and converting of others not in your religion means that your deity unfairly punishes certain people. While this is primarily targeted at Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, it can apply to any religion where humans are judged and then receive an eternal reward/punishment. When you have a religion that calls for a \u201cspreading of the gospel\u201d, to use the Christian term, you have a deity that has whether or not you're a member of his church in his list of qualifications for getting your eternal reward. Most religions explain that it is necessary (or even mandatory) for receiving the reward. \n\nThis is when I would ask what about people that never knew your religion? My usual example is people that lived in either Ancient Egypt, Greece, or other prehistoric societies, or native populations that live far remote from your church. Most explain these as either \u201cThey get a free pass\u201d or \u201cThey never knew *My Deity*, so they receive eternal punishment.\u201d \n\nThis leads me to say this: Either you have a deity that is willing to punish whole civilizations that never got a chance to view \u201cthe truth\u201d, or one that let's anyone in who never had to make a choice. If it's the first, why would you want to worship someone like that? If it is the latter, why tell anyone if ignorance is a free pass?\n\nTL;DR: Either you have a massively unfair deity, or one that you wouldn't want to share the religion about.

CMV\n\nComment: Good day to you reading this,\n\nFirst off, before you start hating read my arguments and reflect upon them.\n\nMulticulturalism is the latest politics-hype with which elections are won. Sometimes based solely on that topic. What we are told everyday is that diversity is good, keeping to oneself bad. And that is nonsense. Since this is a very delicate topic I'd like to point out that there exists no black and white and some arguments might be misunderstood/formulated/etc. Constructive criticism is always welcome in that case.\n\nNow. The reason why we have many different cultures is because every culture has different customs and levels of tolerance. Whereas level of tolerance will be the main focus since it is a large part of customs. These differences in tolerance towards certain things, might it be eating habits, couples interaction, acceptance of a political view (e.g. capitalism or socialism),etc are the core differences between societies. By trying to enforce a multicultural environment you are basically destroying cultural difference. Of course there will always be some stereotypical things for each country but in the big picture there won't be such a big difference. We see this happening on a world scale when it comes to economical systems. The West is of one single opinion: capitalism is good, socialism bad. Israel good, Muslim countries bad (a bit old example i know). Not the best examples but I think you get the idea. \n\nIf you try to accommodate everyone in every country than what are the differences between different countries? Would be sad if the last means of differentiating between cultures and thus people would be their language. Thus we need to stop to accept and accommodate and leave it at tolerating! This means that we tolerate somebody asking what kind of meat we are serving in a food but putting up a sign would be acceptance and accommodation, (I'm talking about the religious aspects regarding pork.) which is not acceptable. (Sounds harsh but a slippery slope is very likely if you don't start with the most mundane things.) The country you are living in has a predominant culture to which you have to assimilate for the most part. You cannot expect that culture assimilating to you. Thus Muslima walking around in a Burka in the US or Europe is as unacceptable as a western woman running around in hot pants and spaghetti shirt in a Muslim country. This ALWAYS goes both ways, which most ignorant and arrogant Westerners like to forget. I find it outrageous that Muslims can go to court and sue a school for having crosses hanging in classrooms. This is unbelievable behavior that cannot be accepted. A country with a Christian heritage DOES NOT have to bend to the wishes of a Muslim. If they dont like it then there are enough Islamic countries in the world she can emigrate to. (Very controversial point. Don't start picking on the cross hanging there in general, the point here is about religion!)\n\nNow I'm not hating Muslims in general I'm just hating against particular individuals and where I come from it is morally unacceptable to speak up against the \"needs\" of minorities, even if it means breaking with our own historic traditions.

CMV\n\nComment: I'll start by saying that I think that a rape victim is NEVER even slightly to blame for his/her rape. It is always 100 percent the rapists fault. Anyone should be able to dress how they want, go out and get as drunk as they want, and walk home alone without fear of being assulted, etc.\n\nHowever, the world that we live in has bad people in it. We tell people not to steal yet we have thiefs. We tell people not to kill but murders exist. People who commit crimes typically know what they are doing is wrong.\n\nI'll give a relevant example. I worked behind the counter at a golf course that just happened to be adjacent to a police station. At least one time every two weeks over the summer I worked there, someone would have the window in their vehicle broken and their computer/suitcase/extra golf bag was stolen. There was one thing in common with every incident: the victim left valuable things in plain sight.\n\nNow, was it ever their fault? No. Absolutely not. After a few break ins, we put out a warning that thiefs were in the area and to hide valuable things out of plain sight. The number of break ins plummeted, and the only people who got hit were people who ignored the warning and left their computer bag in the front seat. It STILL wasn't their fault, but they could have done things to not have been a victim of theft.\n\nThis example is not perfect because I'm not advocating for \"covering up\" (like it may sound).  Thiefs will go for easy targets.  For a theif, that means they can look in a window and see a computer, so they break the window.  A rapist may go for an east target.  That has no connection to anything visual.  \n\nI agree with the idea of \"teach people not to rape\". You will never get rid of rapists, though. Male or female. Teaching people how to avoid situations where they have a higher chance of being raped is SMART, not victim blaming. I think there are ways we can improve \"consent education\". There are ways we can improve societal awareness. We will Never eliminate people who ignore right vs wrong.\n\nAuthor: t3_1q8hil\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

Most of my kids are about 7. I never imagined I would like working with children, because I believed they would not be logical enough for me to enjoy talking to (that sounds incredibly snobby, but really, we all like conversations to more or less make sense). After spending a few months in the classroom, mostly helping kids with homework, I started to feel that most of the disadvantaged, poverty-ridden kids were quite a bit smarter and more logical than I was. \n\nMost of our kids are English language learners. I often found myself describing common words to them, and they would rephrase it back until we reached the point of clearly talking about the same thing (because I don't speak their language). I tried to describe a boat once: \"A boat floats in the ocean or rivers, and can carry people and things. It can have sails or paddles to move.\" The child I was speaking to then asked if logs were a kind of boat. I said they weren't, realizing they did fall into my definition. I explained boats were man-made, and she told me logs were too (they're cut down trees). This went on for some time, and I did eventually convey what a boat was, and she was able to explain it far better than I did (although unfortunately I don't remember her wording). This type of thing happens all the time, and not just with defining words. I'm \"smart;\" high IQ, good grades in school, high SAT score, blah blah, but \"average\" kids outsmart me all the time.\n\nI think people assume kids aren't very logical because kids often reach incorrect conclusions, but those conclusions make a lot of sense if you have the knowledge level of a child. For example, a friend commented to me how she knew a guy who set a field on fire as a young kid. He wanted to make a campfire in a grassy field.. He drew a circle with a stick in the dirt, and built his fire, assuming the circle would contain the fire. Of course, it didn't, because there was grass on both sides of the circle. It burned the whole field. Silly kid!\n\nExcept, not from his perspective. He saw his parents make campfires lots of times before. They always drew a circle around the fire area and explained to him that he must not stand inside the circle, but outside it he was safe from its reach. Sometimes they cleared away plants near the circle, but not always (because sometimes it was already clear, but he wouldn't know this was why). Their campfires never spread. Naturally, he assumed the thing they always did prevented the thing that never happened, not the thing they only sometimes did. If you didn't know how fire worked or what was flammable (and he'd probably never seen grass burn), the hypothesis that the circle somehow prevented the fire from spreading isn't too crazy. What hypothesis makes more sense, given the knowledge he had?\n\nThis is just one example, but I don't feel the need to waste your time with more. I think kids are pretty smart and reasonable thinkers, even if their brains are far from fully developed. We usually think they aren't, because we don't understand their perspectives well.

CMV.\n\nComment: I fail to see how any conscious being--even somebody in excruciating, untreatable pain--can be thought to benefit from dying. Sure, when a person dies, their suffering stops. But *they* stop, too. Their consciousness vanishes. Nobody's *there* to enjoy not suffering. For this simple reason, I think euthanasia never benefits the person whose life is ended.\n\nBut might it be morally beneficial *overall*? If morality is a total measure of happiness and suffering over time (with happiness counting positively and suffering counting negatively), then if we cut short the life of someone who was only going to lower the overall balance with his misery, don't we raise the total? It seems so. But this same logic would tell us to euthanize anyone whose lifetime suffering was bound to outweigh his lifetime happiness, and that's\u2026 certainly counterintuitive. And at any rate, even if the overall happiness/suffering balance is improved, this still plainly fails euthanasia's professed purpose, which is to relieve the suffering *of the person whose life is ended.*\n\nI'm trying to see an angle from which euthanasia makes moral sense, but I just can't.

CMV please.\n\nComment: I live in America and do not vote. I feel it is a waste of time and energy for me to vote. I understand democracy is important and am glad to live in a country that allows me to vote but I choose not to exercise that right. In theory democracy is great but in reality it is not... here's why I feel that way. Please CMV.\n\n1. **A single vote does not make a big difference.** I'm talking about only one single vote (my vote)... not the collection of all single votes put together. I can spend hours watching presidential debates, doing research, vetting candidates before finally deciding who I want to vote for but then my vote could easily be nullified by the next person who didn't do any research or thinking and decides to vote for someone else just because that candidate is republican/seems like a nice guy/is catholic/has nice hair/is african-american, etc. I think George Carlin said it best..., \"the best case against democracry is to just talk to the average voter\". I feel like voting in america is just a step up from your high school elections... high school students vote for whoever is the most popular, is the best athlete, or promises to cut the school day in half (hah!).\n\n2. **People are too easily swayed by the unimportant things** To add onto point #1 I think too many voters are swayed but unimportant things. They do not take the time or effort to really research their candidates and instead use superficial reasons to vote for someone (nice hair, nice personality, etc). Presidential candidates these days spend way too much money on hair stylists, fashion consultants etc. Sure you want to look presentable at least but why do you need fashion strategists? It's ridiculous that people would be swayed by which side you part your hair towards but apparantley there are people out there this affects if candidates are willing to allocate budget for their fashion strategy.\n\n3. **The American voting system (for presidential elections at least) has turned into a game.** Apparently not everyone's importantance is equal in America. Candidates know California is a strong democratic state so why go campaign there? California is pretty much locked up for democrats so candidates will go elsewhere to sway votes. So are Californians not important enough for a visit? I guess so.\n\n4. **Those with more money/power/influence can influence the vote more strongly than a single voter.** This country was bought and paid for a long time ago. Those with the money  and power can influence those in government to be on their side by voting for specific legislation by donating  \"gifts\" to them.\n\n5. **The American political system is set up so people feel it is a career track rather than a public service.** These people get paid highly, get many great perks, are generally the last to feel budget cuts, and are able to influence their compensation. All these things combined will attract the wrong kind of people... greedy people rather than people that want to help the American public. It also makes it harder for incumbents to want to \"give up\" this lifestyle so they are willing to do whatever it takes to keep their jobs (e.g. flip flop on a position to garner more votes).\n\n6. **Politicians jump to the side that get them the most votes.** To expand on point #5... politicans need votes to win office so why would they ever support an unfavorable platform? They generally wouldn't. They \"strategize\" in their back offices on which platforms would get them the most votes. I would prefer they do what's best for the country and it's people but I guess that's asking for too much.\n\nI could give more points but I'm too flustered right now but I think this is enough.\n\nPlease CMV because I am cynical and hate thinking the worst but this is what I see in the American politcal system.  But don't get me wrong, I think Democracy is still better than other forms of government but sometimes I feel a benevolent dictatorship is better than a corrupt democracy.\n\nAuthor: t3_1n1fb8\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

I have never studied art formally. I dabble as a hobby in painting, writing, and singing + some instruments.\n\nBy **work of art**, I mean any creative physical or abstract expression. Paintings and sculpture, composition and rendition of music, prose, performance art, etc.\n\nBy **message**, I mean a sentiment or emotion or other method of provoking conscious thought. Messages don't have to take a particular form; \"melancholy\" is a very abstract concept but my idea of melancholy and your idea of melancholy are isomorphic to some degree. Messages usually, but not always, have an intended audience.\n\nBy **value**, I mean the success of the artist - if you could somehow compare the content of the message received by the audience to the content of the artist's intended message, \"valuable\" art would have perfect sync between artist and audience. \n\nBy **valid value judgments**, I mean to say that an audience who does not come to the artist's intended conclusion (or an approximation) has not *understood* the work of art. To critique a work of art with a valid judgment of its value, one must understand the art on a similar level that the artist understood the art.\n\n\nAny work of art can be interpreted in different ways.

Their sentiments begin to converge as the artist does a better job.\n\nThis isn't to say that the message that *you* receive from the art is any less valuable. If you look at Warhol's can of soup and feel awash with an invigorated understanding of society, that's awesome! Your interpretation of art is a highly personal experience, and lots of people have very positive (or negative) psychological experiences after viewing a work of art. \n\nHowever, I believe the best works of art - those with the most value, from a holist perspective (as in, the best when objectively analyzed as a whole - how did the artist do in hir attempt, given the infinite possibilities s/he faced?) - are the works of art that evoke strong, similar responses from the intended audience.\n\nCreating a work of art is a skill just like building a house. A great house does what it was intended to do - and if other people discover unintended benefits, great! A great work of art does what it was intended to do - deliver a message from the artist to hir audience; but the greatness is not dependent on unintended benefits. \n\nA great artist tells you something; a shoddy artist sells you something.\n\nAuthor: t3_2d1fim\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

CMV\n\nComment: Of course it's impossible to make such generalizations about every case all the time with something as messy as human relations - but I'm talking most cases here.  \n\nFirst I'll define what is referred to as the 'friendzone.'  Broadly I define this as a situation where a man has romantic or sexual desires for a women he socializes with, but those desires are not reciprocated.  This creates a situation where the relationship remains on a platonic friendship level, despite the man's desires.  I'll divide those into two broad categories.  \n\n1) A situation where the women gives indications that at some point in the future the relationship can be taken to a more romantic level.  In return the women receives attention, emotional support, or material goods from the man, despite no intention of follow through.  In other words 'leading on' the man.  \n\nOf course this happens, and it can be emotionally painful.  But ultimately the man has control of his own actions.  Once he realizes that it's happening he can choose to limit or eliminate contact. There are jerks in every category of population, women included.   It is part of having effective social skills to deal with these jerks in a mature way.  Blaming all women for their actions is immature and a inaccurate generalization.  \n\n2) The other type of 'friendzone' situation, is where a man and women are friends and the man has romantic desires and the women doesn't, and she gives no indication to him that she will ever reciprocate this desire.  I believe this is the vast majority of cases, even some that men will write off as 'leading on.'  Think about it - it's almost as hard to reject someone as it is to be rejected.  We are socialized to avoid direct confrontation where ever possible.  Therefore, outside of some confession of love from the man in this kind of situation, the woman doesn't want to create a scene by using strong language - 'I don't like you like that' - out of the blue because if she does she is the asshole.  In fact I think men who complain about the friendzone are particularly effective in avoiding any situation which will lead to an outright rejection because it's emotionally painful.  I shouldn't have to say it but a women doesn't owe a guy to sleep with him just because he is nice or offers her friendship or emotional support.  \n\nFor straight men, imagine a situation where you are friends with a gay guy.  He is a nice guy, and offers you emotional support.  You enjoy having fun with him.  But you aren't attracted to him.  Sometimes you suspect he might be attracted to you, and sometimes he is flirty.  But he never comes out and says it.  Suddenly confronting him and saying 'Look, I'm not attracted to you like that' in the middle of a social situation would be extremely uncomfortable.  Besides you shouldn't have to, you've made it pretty clear you're not attracted to him and never gave him any indication otherwise.  \n\nBottom line, rejection and emotional pain is part of dating.  Dealing with this pain is part of having effective social skills.  Women don't owe guys to sleep with them simply because they are nice.  \n\nI think that men who complain about the 'friendzone' or that 'girls don't like nice guys' are unfairly blaming women for their own poor social skills.

Thankfully this forum allows us to speak candidly about our thoughts so here's mine.\n\nI believe that we as Americans have progressed to unprecedented new levels of tolerance in our country. Looking 20 years back one might not have ever believed that we would evolve to a place where America actually feels like \"one for all, and all for one\".\n\nI know there are people that still feel that discrimination based on sex, race, sexuality or whatever else exist, and I can concede that we have not eradicated it completely.

Any of those things 20 years ago would have seemed like they were decades if not centuries away, but here we are in a 2014 that is more accepting then ever before.\n\nI believe we've been able to evolve to this state in America because people have realized that a lot of the reasons they hold prejudices was do to lack of information. With the expansion of the internet, endless amounts of information is now accessible to every American. I believe this information is what has led us to become more tolerable, which is not something that can be measured. \n\nSomething that can be measured that I think correlates to information is religionism. If we look at the statistics, atheism and agnosticism is on the rise since the expansion of the internet. I don't think this is a coincidence, since like prejudices, belief in religion also often stems from lack of information.\n\nWith that said, why do I believe that hating people can bring America together? I believe that we need to start hating the same people, and that our hate should be derived from information, not lack of it.\n\nWho should we hate? I believe that we should hate those who refuse to live in America under these 3 rules. \n\n**1. Do not cause harm to anyone; treat others how you would want to be treated.**\n\n**2. If you want to be a part of this society you have to contribute to it (if you are physically able to); you cannot just leach off of it.**\n\n**3. Do not impose on people's free will; if they are not hurting you or anyone else, you do not need to worry about them.**\n\nThese are my 3 rules, and I believe regardless if you are gay, straight, black, white, male, female, dinosaur or whatever else that if you live by these 3 rules your OK in my book. \n\nI believe that most Americans would agree with those 3 principles. Maybe there is one or two that you might oppose or rephrase but I think that those 3 principles is what's allowed us to progress to the point that we are at now. \n\nSo looking at these 3 rules who are the biggest violators?\n\nRule 1- Criminals. Hate criminals, they are the ones who have taken the liberty to cause harm to you. If we collectively chose to hate criminals, we would not segregate them based on race or gender, but simply off of their actions.\n\nRule 2- People who steal, take advantage of the system, live by the notion \"the working man is a sucka\". These people should be hated, and exposed for stealing your hard earned money, while contributing nothing to the betterment of our society. \n\nRule 3- Politicians who support things like the NSA or the war on drugs. These are people who believe that your rights need to be diminished, so their control can be increased, all under the guise of keeping us safe. \n\nThese 3 people, criminals, moochers &amp; control hungry politicians are who we as Americans should hate, and that hate is fully defensible by information. So next time someone tells you they hate Jamie, and you look at Jamie ask yourself if he fits in any of those 3 categories. If he does, then exclude the fact that Jamie might be black, or that Jamie might be gay, or that Jamie might be a woman, and think that maybe he doesn't like Jamie because Jamies an asshole.\n\nI think if we as Americans did this, we can unite under a new scale of acceptance. One based off of logic and information, not mindless prejudice and ignorance. Change My View.\n\nTL;DR Hate people who treat you bad, mooch of the system &amp; violate your rights. Don't hate them based off of historic labels.\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_26vz94\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

We see this system used in many things like in tv shows. (The Voice, for example) I think that this is a wonderful and fair system which works well when all voters have sufficient skill to judge candidates. In The Voice, the audience is adequately equipped to decide who is the best singer. People are fully capable of voting on things like their favorite ice cream, or their favorite tv show.\n\nThis system breaks down when the voters do not have the necessary skills or knowledge to make a proper judgement. Take for example, a boxing match. Many matches go to the judges, and most members of the audience do not have boxing experience. If the audience were allowed to vote for the winner, it would often result in the winner being chosen via a popularity contest rather than by the rules of the ring. Most people watching a match would not be able to give an accurate judgement of the match simply because their seat in the stadium or their seat in front of a tv does not permit them to reliably count the number of clean punches.\n\nLet's take another example, Net Neutrality. Most people probably spent 10 minutes reading an article by someone who spent 10 minutes googling the subject before writing. And now they think they know everything there is to know. The Net Neutrality documents are hundreds of pages and would take weeks to read through and analyze. Industry experience would be a requirement in making a proper decision. See the danger of letting the average person cast a vote?\n\nFinally, let's address the voting of political candidates. Each candidate represents an allegiance to a bundle of different policies, which represents thousands of pages of documents, which can represent years of reading and analysis. Understandably, citizens are not allowed to vote on individual policies.\n\nThe only alternative to an equal weight system is to weigh the votes differently. I believe that each person should have a number of votes equal to the amount of federal taxes paid for the previous year (or some variation, like average of past 3 years).\n\nThis would be the effects:\n\n1) Any attempt for the wealthy to reduce their taxes will result in destroying their own voting power. This is key and many people don't get this. The system is self correcting in that you cannot choose to not pay tax and also control the government at the same time.\n\n2) You would get a vote size proportional to your contribution to society. It seems rather fair that you should have a bigger say of what to do with the money if you contribute more.\n\n3) There is a high correlation between intelligence and income. Weighing votes this way would help to put more voting power into the hands of people who are more likely to make better decisions.\n\n4) We'll finally be able to have smart politicians instead of popular politicians in office. From what I've seen, the smartest politicians who can actually address issues are not popular. Any time a politician goes into specifics of why something has to be a certain way, the audience doses off. Most of America wants to be entertained with buzzwords and \nit often results in candidates manipulating the voters into voting against their own interests.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2e3t22\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

Or is David Cross right in that [\"Life begins when you first smile\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyl5RgybB4#t=0m32s)? If life begins at conception, then aborting that entity is by definition murder. And this is how most pro-life people see it. But pro-choice people don't see it exactly like this. \n\nMany pro-choice women say \"It's my body and I can do whatever I want with it\", a sentiment I completely agree with. But I think it becomes tricky when dealing with something that, for the most part, everyone agrees is **inherently wrong**. Self-damaging things like smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are inherently bad. However, they are not illegal because every person has the right to do whatever they want with **their own body**. Murder, on the other hand, is illegal, because it is affecting **another person**. So this brings us to the definition of life. At what point does the fetus become more than just the mother's cells and become its own living entity?\n\nWhile the \"my own body\" claim is very strong and in my opinion very true, it's hard to use that to convince the other side. Just as it's hard for pro-life to say \"Abortion is wrong because it's murder! Don't murder people!\" when pro-choice people don't exactly see it that way. A fair discussion can't be had between the two parties because they're not arguing with the same facts, i.e. a concrete definition of what constitutes a human life with rights of its own.\n\nOnce the definition of life is established, then there can be arguments made regarding religion, women's rights, etc.\n\nI rest my case and yield the remainder of my time to the chair.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2ku5xf\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

Its an ideology that is pretty hard to pin point exactly, but I would like to focus on a few of its core tenants.\n\n[Here's](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism) the Dictionary definition, though I'm going to elaborate on my own view of what it is, and how it relates to Reddit. Again, these are just the general core of fascism which may be a simplified version, but this is what I'm basing my argument from. \n\n[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/22ox1w/what_is_fascism/) AskHistorians thread is very useful in its explanation of the ideology.\n\nFascism originated from a European intellectual movement which criticized the alienating effect that industrial society had on the modern human being, as well as late 19th century critiques of Liberalism, and democracy. After WW1, and in the 1930s the movement successfully harnessed people\u2019s frustration from the damaged modern systems of government and society which it directed through political means.\n\n\nThis is what I would consider one of the most important fundamentals of fascism. The idea that the populace of society is irrational, and misinformed, thus society needs strong leadership figures (the elite and educated) to \"whip\" the ignorant masses in line with the \"right\" track. \n\nIf you browse any of the default subreddits that focuses on politics like /r/worldnews, or any other subreddit that may have a political discussion, the general consensus that tend to be upvoted the highest are the ones stating that the people are too \"stupid\" to know what's good for them.\n\nAny thread discussing democracy would usually have higher upvoted comments like \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the Redditors are almost entirely similar in context to the origination of fascism. They tend to blame the social ills of society on democracy and liberalism, and also tend to express their frustrations with the current system by advocating more authoritarian measures and even the glorification of dictators.\n\nSome times when a global warming thread comes up, you'd see high upvoted comments suggesting...\n\n\n\nAlong with the idea that elite figures are needed to \"Shepard\" the masses, there also seems to be a generally accepted tenancy to favor cold pragmatism even if they know it compromises individual rights and liberties. This is also a core fascist idea.\n\nAnother reflection of Reddit's leaning towards very fascist ideals is its favor of ethno-cultural and national identity. Ethnocentrism is a universal among all people, but Redditors seem to praise and glorify the us-vs-them tribal nationalistic mentality. Going off of the defaults, there is an incredible amount of racism, and xenophobia among Redditors, with an open hatred to diversity and liberalism. They hold white western culture on a pedestal, and even go as far as to advocate the legal exclusion of all other cultures based on their ethnocentrism and nationalism. Any time there is a thread about immigration, there will always be comments hating on liberals and the idea of multiculturalism, a general lack of sympathy towards foreigners, an idea of \"this is my country and I deserve to live here more than you, because my ancestors lived here,\" and a mentality of us-vs-them. All people have slight irrational ethnocentric and xenophobic tendencies, but the problem I see with Redditors is that they openly embrace them as good qualities.\n\nThough these views may not reflect the entirety of Reddit, it does reflect the general consensus. \n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_24sr4k\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

I submit that our use of imprisonment as a punishment for criminals is absurd: not only is it a tremendous public expense, but it manages to combine the worst aspects of soft-headedness and brutality, resulting in a system that amounts to a factory farm for breeding hardened criminals.\n\nI am not here to suggest that we should treat crime as a public health issue and send all our criminals to asylums where they can be worked over with drugs and therapy. There is a place for that, when one is dealing with genuine insanity, but in general I think that criminals ought to be treated as volitional agents who are responsible for their actions. Therefore, I think the *primary* aim of the criminal justice system (after making sure the victims are compensated), should be *punishment*, with rehabilitation being the responsibility of the individual.\n\nBut speaking of insanity, it's really hard to think of a more deranged way of punishing criminals than what we have now. As I see it, there are three main arguments for the widespread use of prisons:\n\n* **It is an effective form of rehabilitation.**\n\nNow *that* is a sick joke. Every kind of social situation has its own subculture, formed by how those who are part of it interact with one another. There's an army culture, the \"ivory tower\" culture of academia, the culture of Washington bureaucracy, and so on. There's also a prison culture: the culture of hardened criminals. Sending people to prison socializes them into that culture. The longer they're there, the more they are socialized into it. If going to college teaches you how to be an educated member of the middle class, going to prison teaches you how to be a criminal.\n\nI need hardly add that, when a person is sent to prison, the years of his life that are taken are typically the prime years of his life, the years which are most crucial for gaining work experience. When he is released, the criminal knows nothing of how to work in any honest trade. Yes, prisons do have certain educational facilities and some even have work-release programs, but I seriously doubt that the positive socialization they provide counteracts the anti-socialization of the prison environment.\n\nI'm not going to focus too much on this, since I believe it is so incredibly obvious that prisons fail at rehabilitation. But I will also add that I dispute even the goal of rehabilitation as something the state should strive for. Rehabilitation implicitly places the responsibility for a person's behavior with the state, and not with the individual himself. If a person wants to rehabilitate himself, great. But the state's role should only be to ensure that people suffer the consequences of their actions.\n\n* **It is an effective form of punishment.**\n\nThis has more plausibility, since the thought of being sent to prison is terrifying for any normal person. But the real question is: how effective is imprisonment versus other potential forms of punishment, such as corporeal punishment? I submit: not very.\n\nFirst of all, concerning the deterrent factor, I daresay that the average person does not even *know* what sentence he is likely to receive for a particular crime outside of a *very* general sense. For example, under federal law, a rapist can be [\"imprisoned for any term of years or life\"](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2241). That is, the sentence can literally range from zero to infinity. Even if criminals were disposed to coolly consider exactly how much \"time\" they will do for a crime and determine whether it's worth it (and they're not so disposed), they can't.\n\nSecond, the terror of going to prison is significantly diminished by the fact that many of the worst criminals, such as the members of gangs, see it as a sort of \"rite of passage\". They know that when they are sent in, they will be backed up by members of their gang, and in many cases will practically be allowed to \"run the asylum\".\n\nThird (and closely connected with the first), it is well known that criminals do not carefully weigh the relative sentences of various crimes when deciding how to act. Let's say we doubled every prison sentence for rape, starting today. Everyone who was slated to get 10 years would get 10 more years (at state expense, never forget!). Just how many rapists, previously undeterred, would now shrink away at the thought of an increased sentence? Not very many.\n\nFourth, it's hardly as if prisoners spend every waking moment quaking with terror and regret for their crimes. I'm sure they're pretty traumatized for...a month or two, perhaps? Then they get used to it, just like human beings can get used to any situation, no matter how bad it is.\n\nWith all of these considerations, I think that rapists would be equally well punished and deterred if, immediately after sentencing (or with a short delay for the filing of injunctions), they were taken outside the courthouse and administered whatever corporeal punishment the court deemed fitting. In the case of rape, that could be anything from a few lashes with a whip for cases with mitigating factors to castration or worse in severe cases. A few brief moments of pain, enough to instill someone with fear at the thought of it, but then an end to it. Then, a period of brief imprisonment (as I said, no more than around six months) to allow him to \"cool off,\" and release into society.\n\nCorporeal punishment unnerves people because it's a visible and bloody form of suffering, but I really think it is far more humane and civilized than the years of invisible suffering that prison causes. And if you think it is *too* humane, then one need only to increase the severity of the punishment. Make it as bloody a form of torture as you think necessary to instill the same level of fear, it's still better both for the criminal and society than wasting billions for the purpose of robbing men of years of their lives which could be put to productive use.\n\nMoreover, corporeal punishment is far more fair and precise in its application than imprisonment as a form of punishment. While it is true that some people feel pain more intensely than others, this slight disparity pales in comparison to the situation inside prisons. Many prisons have such an atmosphere of rampant lawlessness that assault, rape, and even murder are commonplace and often tacitly tolerated by the public, which views this as part of the punishment. But this creates the perverse effect that the worst criminals within a given prison are the most lightly punished. *They* run the gangs, *they* bribe the guards, *they* force themselves on men who are too weak to resist. If people really think that the appropriate punishment for child rapists is to be forcibly sodomized, then they ought to stand up and admit it. Not *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge* \"don't drop the soap!\"\n\n* **It keeps the criminals contained.**\n\nThis, I will grant, is a legitimate purpose of prisons. It is the *only* legitimate purpose of long-term imprisonment. There are some criminals who are so vicious that they cannot be trusted to be let back into society. They have to be separated from it, either by death (which I do think is the just punishment for some crimes, but which is not essential to my point) or by being locked away from it. But this ought to be the very last resort.\n\nIt is also not a punishment. When you shoot a rabid dog, it is not because the dog did something wrong, but because it must be killed to protect society. A criminal, to be sure, has done something wrong, but the fact that he may need to be imprisoned should not be considered part of his punishment.\n\nFor example, let's take the case of \"white collar crime\" (leaving aside the fact that many of them, like Martha Stewart, have done nothing wrong). There is no reason for someone like Bernie Madoff to be in prison. Beat the shit out of him, cut off one hand (or both!) for stealing, or administer whatever punishment you think is necessary to \"give the bastard what he deserves\". But are our streets really safer at night because Madoff isn't out there prowling them? With his reputation ruined, the chances of him pulling another scheme are basically zero. If he is not an objective threat to society, then we should not be paying to have him live at public expense.\n\nIf, in the judgment of a court, a criminal presents too great a threat to society to be released after his punishment is administered, then he should be given an indefinite (that is, life with parole) sentence. Every year (or two years, or whatever period is deemed best), a parole board should evaluate him to see whether he is still a danger to the public. If he is not a danger to the public, he should be released immediately, no matter what his crimes were. (For example, a former serial killer who is now 90 years old, paraplegic, and dying of cancer would not, in any normal case, be a threat to society.)\n\nIf you think that someone's crimes are so great that he should never be released even if he is no longer a danger, then that person should be sentenced to death in the first place. (Again, whether that is by execution or the \"slow death sentence\" of life without the possibility of parole, is immaterial.)\n\nAnd, as I said, indefinite (life) sentences should be a last resort, saved only for recidivists and the most extreme offenders. It may seem unusual to us to take an armed robber and let him go six months after receiving some form of corporeal punishment, rather than keeping him for 5-20 years, but recidivism rates could hardly be worse: [70.2% for robbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism#Recidivism_rates), for example, are arrested again (granted, as of 1994). Those long years do essentially nothing, besides making the criminal older and literally less able to commit crimes. A sharp but brief punishment (perhaps even the loss of a hand, in the case of robbery with the threat of deadly force) deters just as much and leaves the criminal far more able to get his life back on track than even five years in prison.\n\nFinally, and this could be its own topic, any criminals that do need to be locked up should *never, under any circumstances*, be allowed to interact with one another. If they want to meet with lawyers, family members, volunteer workers, fine. But they should never be allowed to congregate or talk to a fellow prisoner. The fact that this is allowed is pure madness to me. Deliver food to the cells. When grouping them together can't be helped, such as with showers, enforce a strict rule of no communication. Give them books so they don't go crazy in their cells. But the point should be isolation, not \"criminal community college.\"\n\n* **What about \"paying off one's debt to society\"?**\n\nI am all for criminals paying off their debt to society, but this certainly doesn't add to the case for prison. I think that, when a victim demonstrates a provable harm that was caused to him by a criminal, the state ought to immediately pay out that sum to the victim. Then, that sum ought to be issued as a debt that the criminal owes to the state, to be taken from any income the criminal may receive in the future. There is no need for people to be locked up on chain gangs, or even on work-release programs, in order to do this. In fact, those programs cost more than they make in revenue. As Robert Nozick pointed out, there is really no difference between taking someone's labor by force and taking his wages by force, except that the latter is far more efficient. No one can repay his debt to society if he is literally living on the dole, costing more than he brings in.\n\n**Anyway, I know this was a long post, and I expect that it will be divisive. All I ask is that you consider what really *is* best, and not just what is sanitized and makes people feel comfortable.**\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2elclm\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

A few examples of this phenomena are the idea that \"Fox news is brainwashing its viewers\", \"the media is trying to force everyone in America to become consumers\", and \"Media is trying to force women to conform to one specific ideal of beauty\".\n\nI do not believe this. I think that the people who watch Fox news are already convinced that they're right, and simply want to see a TV show which shows a variety of highly credentialed talking heads grimly agreeing with them. They want to feed their bias, and they want to feel like they're ahead of the curve. And to be clear, this goes equally for people who watch MSNBC for the same reasons. People who consume drive-by journalism do so because they like how it makes them feel, and because they likely didn't have a strong affinity for correctness in the first place. Not because the media is stamping out their critical thought.\n\nSimilarly (for my second example above), people love being consumers. Nobody needed the media to want instant gratification - that is simply our nature. This is backed up by a dozen studies in primate behavior. All animals (us included) seem to prefer a bird in the hand over two in the bush, regardless of the cost of the one in hand. Further, individuals don't buy nice furniture and brag about their 57\" TVs because the media tells them to, they do it because they want to feel like they've got something special. Something that others ought to pat them on the back for. This isn't new, the entire concept of luxury goods extends back as long as human history.\n\nTherefore, i believe that the idea that the media is forming our expectations and behaviors is ludicrous.

And peaceful resistance. And daring displays of forbidden love.  \n\nAnd while many people were responsible for this, the relevant one to X-Men, is Martin Luther King Jr. A flawed man, he was a bit of a womanizer...\n\nThe symbol of the opposition, of anger, was another man. Charismatic, charming, and very logical - if you ever see interviews with Malcolm X, it's amazing how reasonable he is, while talking about his enemies, and his belief that there will always be war. \n\nI can't do justice to their lives here, but I encourage anyone to read up on them, or watch Youtube clips. It's worth the time. History books really don't do justice to it all. \n\nWhich brings us to X-Men: First Class. \n\nXavier is King. Magneto is Malcolm X. And due to some really tone deaf decisions, there's no other characters worth mentioning, except Mystique, and her struggles to fit into a world that's sexist and racist, while being caught between these two powerful men.  \n\nSure, that's kind of...not how she came across anywhere, ever, but...it's still an actual sympathetic character arc, even if it belongs to a mostly neutered, suddenly passive character.\n\nUnfortunately, she's the only woman with an actual character arc. While the sexism throughout the movie was very deliberate, co-writer Jane Goldman has said in interviews that there was supposed to be a subplot for CIA agent Moira MacTagger about normal unpowered women of the time being outsiders outside of their homes. Unfortunately, that part was edited out in the final cut, while the playful sexism from the men remained...\n\nAnd the rest of the women? The retro-sexuality from nearly every woman in the story makes sense if you know that the writer used to write for Cosmo and they were trying to pay tribute to old Bond style narratives. But again, decisions made by the filmmakers sabotaged the (very questionable) intentions of the script. January Jones' poor performance as the White Queen meant that the most powerful woman in the entire movie was reduced to a calender girl status that was cringe inducing. Unlike the more complicated anti-hero in the comics, she never demonstrates the dangerous intelligence to establish herself as a genuine threat, before Magneto dominates her in a scene that's far too kink friendly... \n\nYou don't include reto sexism and then forget to counter it. You especially don't forget to counter it, if you have a movie with mutually agreed upon consensual for fun objectification, when you're going to include a disturbing non-consensual domination of the half naked woman in a later scene, and portray it as a good thing. \n\nSuddenly, it's suffering from the same problem as American History X, the touching story of how black people will just randomly fucking shoot those close to you, if you ever turn your back on racism. At least that's what a lot of skinheads got out of the movie. Whoops. Speaking of racism...\n\nDarwin and Angelique, newer mutants from this decade, were added to the original team for the sake of racial diversity. Darwin, while visually amazing on screen, is anything but charismatic in the comics. It was the safe bet to kill him off, since there was little fan attachment compared to the more established characters. Angelique could become a villain, so that Banshee had someone to fight in the air. \n\nHow did nobody notice that this meant a film about civil rights in the 60's killed off the only black hero just to establish how badass the villain was? And only the black hero? Why did the film editor think it was a good idea to focus on the black hero, when the villain talked about being kings or being slaves? \n\nIt's a serious problem for a movie about minority experience in the 60's, which is using the ideological war between Malcolm X and King to give itself intellectual credibility...\n\nSeriously, any racist could watch this movie, and be entertained too. It doesn't matter whether it's deliberate or not. Unconscious ignorance is still a problem.\n\nI know calling this movie racist and sexist might be offensive to those who responded to the character driven conflict at it's heart. In some ways, this is the X-Men's The Dark Knight. \n\nBut it's also the X-Men's Showgirls. And the X-Men's \"Just kill the black guy\" piece of shit. It may be a good movie, but it's also one of the worst. There's really no excuse for mistakes like this to exist... \n\nCMV, if you can. \n\nAuthor: t3_1v1wsu\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

However, as a member of both fandoms (although I've only read the books in the case of Game of Thrones, as I don't have cable or pirate), I've often seen these same aforementioned behaviors for which Doctor Who's fandom is so criticized in the Game of Thrones fandom (especially arguments over whether the books or TV series are superior), yet I've not seen any such criticism of Game of Throne's fandom upvoted nearly as much as ones of Doctor Who's fandom. Is there some obvious reason for this that I'm missing, or is it just the fact that there are proportionally far more GoT fans on Reddit than Doctor Who fans?

They may drop their morals and eat meat if they're vegetarian, for example, or cheat on their partner when in a relationship. As much as it is shameful for doing this, there's a good chance they would never have done it while sober.\n\nThis is the point in the discussion where people normally say \"But they *chose* to get drunk, therefore they need to deal with the consequences!\" and this may be true for a lot of cases - they will often have to deal with their partner breaking up with them for cheating, but they can move on from this easier than say; being put to jail for drunk driving.\n\nSo, in what way do people change when they get drunk? I know of quite a few people who suddenly become easily led, despite being strong and independent while sober. I know of people who become forgetful, they literally *forget* that they're a vegetarian, or that it's wrong to flirt with someone when in a relationship. Also, what if someone has 100% forgotten the incident due to drunkenness -- is it fair to say that it's as if *it wasn't actually them*?\n\nSo, if someone is peer pressured into driving while very drunk, I don't think they should be so heavily prosecuted, as people can become more susceptible to peer pressure or can even forget what they're doing is wrong.\n\nChange my view. \n\n\nYou have one drink. This effects you ever so slightly, but not enough to change how you act significantly. So you have a second through *almost* sober choice. Then maybe a third or even a fourth, still reasonably unaffected. Then you become a bit more \"slurred\" and blas\u00e9 about your actions, so I believe any further drinking is no longer a consequence of the sober and sensible mindset you had at the start. Your opinion of when you've had enough is different when you're sober to when you're drunk. Your first drink was taken by your sober mindset, the second by the mindset created by the first, the third by the second, and so on. Your sober mind doesn't have control over every drink as soon as you've had your first.\n\nAuthor: t3_1b4ngo\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

They break the fourth wall, if you will.\n\nPeter Jackson agrees with me:\n\n\n\nThe main objection to this, of course, will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books, and are therefore better.  Personally, I think it's a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material, rather than by the strength of it's story telling.  The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time *precisely because* they left a whole lot of the books un-filmed, and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor.  They stretched some scenes from brief chapters into center pieces (Helms's Deep) and cut out some of the more... esoteric portions completely (Tom Bombadil).\n\nBasically, I'm glad Jackson opted to make excellent **movies,** instead of attempting a shot for shot visualization of a **book,** and I think the extended cuts subvert his success in that regard.\n\nBooks and movies are not the same, and in general, **the more an adaptation respects the inherent differences between the various media it's adapting to and from, the better the final product will be.**  This is much more important than it's faithfulness to the source material.  I believe this is true for all adaptations, not just LOTR.

Prison rates, violence, homelessness, homosexuality, law, sexuality and sexual crime, fatherhood and fatherless homes, depression and suicide, transgenderism, circumcision, soldiers, mental illness, cultural and societal norms, masculinity and how it's defined, identity. \n\nThese are all amongst the prevailing issues men face. It would be false of me to say that some of these issues are singular to men; however, the majority of these are the issues that disproportionately affect, and are regularly discussed by, men. There are also ones listed above which affect both men and women, in different ways. If I felt like being really contentious, I'd argue that issues that 'only' affect men or women don't exist - we live in shared societies, and issues that affect one will have affects on the other - but for brevities sake I'll leave this point alone.\n\nThird Wave feminism has moved towards intersectionality - that is, including other factors into it's analysis and discussion regarding women and gender such as race, class and so forth. Often, feminists will claim that feminism will help men, by discussing and deconstructing things such as gender roles. I also would not claim that there aren't male feminists who have found feminism entirely useful and helpful in their lives, and happily consider themselves feminists.\n\nBut when I look to popular feminist websites (Jezebel, NOW, feministing) - I don't see the issues men face, especially those listed above, being discussed. In fact, I often see these issues mocked, or furthermore, a statement regarding men's issues or rights as being unimportant. When I look to popular entertainment, I see nothing; unless, again, it's a dismissal of the whole idea, such as Parks &amp; Rec stating \"You're ridiculous and Men's Rights is nothing\". As someone who studied English Literature, feminist academia heavily (and rightly so) leaned towards exploring femininity and female representation and so forth.\n\nYet, whenever this is brought up, the response is typically something akin to, \"those are just radfems\" or \"that's not real feminism, feminism helps men too!\". Where? In what proportion to how it helps women?\n\nAnecdotally, an entertainment blog I visit with a heavy slant of feminism recently posted this article:\n\nhttp://www.pajiba.com/miscellaneous/its-my-birthdaylets-have-a-misandry-party-.php\n\nThis is a blog that has often stated how feminism benefits men too, and how men's rights is useless. But if I were to be a transgender/homosexual/minority/victimized/divorced-father-fighting-to-see-his-children/depressed/suicidal/traumatized man, how exactly am I meant to believe that statement when men's issues are so widely mocked?\n\nI guess my thoughts are that men need their own movement/identity/group to discuss their own issues and problems, just like women had their own. Just like how feminism and women have their own spaces, men also need the same thing. For some men, feminism is an answer, but I don't think it is for the majority of men; especially poor, low class, minority, those in prison, those who suffered sexual abuse, soldiers, and mentally ill men, due to how often their problems are minimalized and ridiculed by feminist's (often, inadvertedly reinforcing traditional gender norms (men should be strong and deal with their problems) in the process).\n\nAm I wrong? Should men not have their own movement, study, and ideology developed to help deal with their issues? Should feminism be the only way we look at gender issues, especially considering it's emphasis and background on the female? Am I incorrect in asserting that the most popular feminist blogs minimize and ridicule male issues, that it get's no mention in popular media, and yet feminist's still expect men to believe it will help them?\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2xk11d\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

If you can't see it, it's a picture of a woman taken in new york with the caption that she only believes her hair and hands to be beautiful. Unsurprisingly, the thread has been inundated with comments from people (most of them women) telling her that she is being too hard on herself, that she is gorgeous, that she should appreciate youth, and other platitudes. While I get that these people are coming from a good place, I don't think it's the right thing to do for the following reasons.\n\nIt's ultimately very condescending. What the commenters are saying when they say \"You're wrong, you're beautiful!!!11!!\" is that is in capable of objectively analyzing herself and that she has to defer to strangers for that information that she can't discern for herself. I think it's very clear to her that she is not a runway model and that she is a little obese, so trying to tell her that she can't see herself properly in the mirror comes off more as an insult, or a \"you're just saying that to make me feel better\" moment.\n\nI also think that it's a good thing when people can look at themselves in an objective way. Very few people face their own flaws and never do anything about them because they are fed this \"love yourself no matter what\" BS, so they go on with a bad personality or a bad diet and never wonder what they are doing wrong, but instead blame other people (Or in this case, the media) for their problems. \n\nI can appreciate people who see the flaws in themselves because then they can take the next step and work to improve themselves. In terms of beauty, I believe that most of it is controllable through dress, hairstyle, and most importantly, maintaining health. They are all controllable things and we all have the power to take control of that. This is what I believe people should put more emphasis on if someone questions their appearance. Tell them that if they don't like how they look, then they have the power to change it and that you believe that they can. \n\n\nAuthor: t3_2o66aa\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: True."}]}

The label was meant to express the notion that I was willing to pursue circumstances that were beneficial to me. Living in a capitalistic society (I'm from the U.S.) I believe that it benefits me to be this way, and should not be interpreted as a negative quality.\n\nThe argument against being an opportunist is that you are not a loyalist. Now granted their are things that you would want to be loyal to and not take the opportunity that may exist. Say for example the ability to date a friends ex, or being able to exploit someone for your own benefit. However, overall I think if you want to be successful in a capitalistic society you have to be an opportunist.\n\nThe whole concept of capitalism reflects around the notion that opportunity exists and is there for the taking. Those who do take it are the ones that are going to be successful. To try to suggest that these people are immoral for such actions is an unfair qualifier in a system that teaches us to be this way. \n\nBeing an immigrant further solidifies my belief that being an opportunist is a good thing. My family pursued the opportunity that the U.S. afforded them and took advantage of coming here and building a better life for themselves. I see no reason why they should have a negative feeling about this opportunity that they have taken, and I think we should motivate more people to be opportunists. That way they too can pursue circumstances that will help better their lives.\n\nIn regards to the new rule: I am looking for a reason why being an opportunist is considered a bad thing. I don't want a circumstantial response. Meaning I don't want scenarios in which opportunity should not be seized, as I have already conceded that those situations exist. However in regards to living a lifestyle of either seizing opportunities vs. not seizing them, I would like to understand why the latter would be considered better and why the former should be considered a negative quality. \n\nChange My View.\n\nP.S. If you don't believe this is a black and white issue, meaning there is no reason to be one or the other, and there should be a healthy blend of the two, then I would agree with you. I also don't think you would have the perspective that being an opportunist is a bad thing if you feel this way. Since I have been labeled this in a negative way, I'm looking to engage in discussions with people who truly believe that being an opportunist is a bad thing, be it for societal reasons, personal reasons or other reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: t3_2phbhy\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

CMV.\n\nComment: I've observed that there are two basic types of people. Please take note that I don't consider neither of them to be better nor worse than the other, I just think that these two groups differ, but both need themselves to live.\n\nThe first group are the most common people. They are the typical pedestrians that you see everyday. They may have boring jobs, as well as fascinating jobs, or none at all. The thing about them is that they don't think about living, they just do it, therefore these people are better suited for living in societies. But they are also easily influenced by the prime instincts that humans have. Their point of life is to find an attractive partner to start a family with, and breed an optimal for their area amount of children.\n\nThe second group are the thinkers, they're the eccentric types that may seem somewhat socially impaired. They think about every purpose of what they do in their lives, and try to find a logical explanation. Because of that, they wonder why should they follow the fashion, do what is \"socially acceptable\" and adapt to their environment. The thinkers don't have to be more intelligent or capable than the common people, they don't have to invent any revolutionary designs. What makes them that group is that they have a skeptic attitude to life.\n\nI feel kind of wrong for dividing people into two basic groups like these, so CMV.\n\nA lot of people get me wrong. As I stated before, I do not believe that any of these groups is better that the other in any way. A lot of people concentrate on particular words I used. For example when I said \"drones\", I didn't literally mean it, what I meant however is that those \"drones\" are not mindless creatures at all, they're normal people just like everyone else. They are not the ones that are different, or should be focused on. The people who are different are the second group, what defines them is their individuality and ability to neglect the \"socially acceptable\" way of life. When I meet a person for the first time, I know nothing about them, and I'm aware of that. I don't make any assumptions about people because that's simply illogical. I can't tell whether a person fits to the first or second group even though I might know them for a longer time, because I can't crawl into anyone's mind and read it.\n\nAuthor: t3_1c8hmr\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

I believe the idea of continuing to increase our debt with out significant decreases in our spending to be pointless and harmful. I also believe that the US government should not have the freedom to operate on a \"do what it thinks is best for the people policy\" (NSA, drone strikes on americans, etc).

CMV\n\nComment: \"The FDA doesn't approve of little tested substances.\"\n\nPeople act like these alternative meds come out of the blue and without any history. Little tested by our white man 1st nation approved science labs... yes true. But these substances have been tested by humans, sometimes for centuries and millenniums. Sort of the same way animals know what not to eat in the wild.\n\nScience is a good objective tool, but could only gain from shedding this ignorance of its environment. Still pretty naive in that aspect IMO, and I think it has a lot to do with the monetary dark ages we're going through.\n\nYes we're seeing more breakthroughs than ever before, so why call dark ages on this one? Well okay let's call it the dim ages instead, to be more precise. This pointing directly at the science for hire, and propaganda from big industries. It fucks good things up, and leads us into the wrong paths, and only a few brilliant minds can sometimes come alone and suggest \"hey wait, where the fuck are we going?! It's actually this way! Come on!\".\n\n\nAuthor: t3_1ia3nb\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

I have had debates with them, and found that all of their arguments make some kind of economic sense, as they have used historical precedent to make their points, which I respect greatly. I also live and go to College in extremely conservative areas, leading to a lack of liberal thinking or decent examples why it wouldn't work. But as I turn more libertarian, I at the same time can't help but find glaring issues with it, a paradox I really want to solve.\n\nI also want to change my view because much of my family is liberal, and I have been very liberal previously.\n\nSo, can anyone change my view on the libertarianism with cold, hard facts rather than emotional responses?\n\nAuthor: t3_1aoscp\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

CMV!\n\nComment: A little backstory first. I am a musician, a small unknown one mind you, but a musician nonetheless. Me and my band are thinking about recording an EP this summer and we are struggling to decide on how we will pay for it. Recording is expensive as fuck. \n\nEven though we wouldnt be making a ton of money from legal downloads, it sickens me to think how most of our music downloads would most likely be pirated, therefore stealing the work that we have spent years writing and putting together.\n\nI think that people like to blame the recording industry, saying that they dont make it accessible enough- and that by doing so people would stop pirating. I think that this is bullshit and most of these people would pirate it either way, because people are greedy. What is the difference between stealing a candy bar and stealing music? I guarantee that I have spent a lot more time and money to produce a 99 cent song than it takes to make a hersheys bar. \n\nHowever people call me the asshole when I say that pirating music is immoral. Why should I embrace people blatantly ripping off my work?\n\nAuthor: t3_20358g\n\nIs this author malleable to persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The malleability status of this author is: False."}]}

The people around her, and her doctors who tell her \"Yeeah... you need sugery 658 for Sure!\" are all enablers that helped cause this death as much as the \"doctor\" who gave Jackson too much of his favorite drug and ODd.\n\nI have nothing against a person who was injured, say caught in a fire, and getting 700 plastic surgeries to try and remove the burn.
